    "pre_caption": "The video presents a static scene against a solid black background that fills the entire frame, viewed from a direct, eye-level perspective. Positioned in the foreground, a cream-colored, ornate rectangular border with decorative corners occupies the majority of the screen, framing a central black area. At the top center of this border, also in the foreground, a logo consisting of a cream-colored stylized bird above the word \"DECLA\" is visible. Centered within the confines of the border, and also in the foreground, is a block of cream-colored text. All visual elements remain fixed in their positions throughout the duration of the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video presents a static title card from an early film, featuring a black background. A simple, cream-colored rectangular border with curved corners frames the card, with a central element at the top containing a logo. This logo consists of a cream-colored stylized bird with spread wings, facing left, positioned above the word \"DECLA\" in a bold, sans-serif uppercase font. Centered within the border, cream-colored text reads: \"A spur provides supplies to a government meteorological outpost, where tests are conducted with weather balloons.\"**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video displays a static intertitle card, characteristic of silent films. The background is solid black. A decorative, light-colored border with simple, curved corners frames the central text. At the top center of this border, a small logo features a stylized bird above the word \"DECLA\" in capital letters. The main text, presented in a cream-colored, sans-serif font, is centered within the frame and reads: “A spur provides supplies to a government meteorological outpost, where tests are conducted with weather balloons.” This text is an overlay on the black background.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
