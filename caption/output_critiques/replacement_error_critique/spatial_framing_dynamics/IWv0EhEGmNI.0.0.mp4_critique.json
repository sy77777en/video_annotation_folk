    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a white sedan, showing the rear and part of the side of the car occupying the right and center portions of the frame in the foreground, with its tail lights and light bar clearly visible. The camera is positioned at the same height as the car, capturing it from a level angle. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to an extreme wide shot, with the car moving away from the camera and becoming much smaller within the frame. In this wider view, the car is positioned near the center and slightly to the right in the background, while the wet road extends horizontally across the lower part of the frame and open fields and distant trees fill the middle ground and background. The camera remains at road level throughout, and no other vehicles or elements are present. The primary spatial movement is the car gradually receding into the distance along the road, emphasizing its motion away from the viewer.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-colored sedan is shown from the rear on a dark road at night. The car's red taillights and license plate are illuminated. The road surface appears wet, reflecting the vehicle's lights. In the background, a tall streetlight is also visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place outdoors at night along a rural road bordered by open fields and distant trees. The environment is dark, with limited visibility except for the glow of the white sedan's headlights and red taillights as it travels away from the viewer. The car’s lights cast reflections on the wet pavement, indicating ongoing rain. The sky is overcast, contributing to the subdued lighting and muted color palette. No other vehicles or pedestrians are visible, and the road appears empty and quiet. There are no overlays, text, or additional visual elements present in the video.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to an extreme wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
