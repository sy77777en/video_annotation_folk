    "pre_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a nighttime landscape, captured from a static, low-angle position. A snow-covered plain occupies the bottom of the frame, extending from the foreground to the middle ground. In the bottom left, a lit building is situated in the middle ground, with a plume of steam rising from it. A line of trees forms the horizon in the background, stretching across the scene. The upper portion of the frame is dominated by the green aurora borealis, which appears as broad bands of light stretching from the top left across the sky and receding into the background. In a time-lapse effect, these bands of light shift and flow across the sky. Stars are visible in the darker sky on the right, and two small red lights are positioned in the center-right, just above the background treeline.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a dramatic landscape scenery shot. Luminous, curtain-like bands of the green aurora borealis dominate the star-dusted night sky, appearing to stretch across the entire frame and disappear in the far distant sky on the left. Below, a flat, expansive snow-covered landscape is sparsely populated with small, brightly lit white buildings that emit plumes of white steam or smoke. A line of dark coniferous trees forms the distant horizon, punctuated by two small red lights on unseen towers.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **At night, a vibrant green aurora borealis fills the sky with broad, shifting curtains of light over a vast, snow-covered landscape. The snow-covered landscape extends from the bottom foreground to the line of dark coniferous trees in the background. In the middle ground, a single-story white building with illuminated windows has a plume of white steam rising near it. A line of dark coniferous trees stands on the horizon, with two distant red lights visible just above them. Stars are visible in the dark portions of the sky not obscured by the aurora.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
