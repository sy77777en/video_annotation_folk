    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of two posters hanging from black binder clips against a dark background. Initially, both posters are dimly lit, with the left poster positioned in the center-left of the frame and the right poster in the center-right. The left poster is in the foreground, while the right poster is slightly behind it in the middle ground. As the scene progresses, a spotlight turns on, illuminating the left poster, which features the word \"Glue\" and a photograph of a metallic object. This poster becomes the focal point, with its bright white surface contrasting against the dark surroundings. The right poster, labeled \"Dry Spell,\" remains in shadow, maintaining its position in the middle ground. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout, emphasizing the posters' details and their spatial relationship within the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Two posters hang from black binder clips against a dark background. The spotlight suddenly turns on. The poster on the left is brightly lit by a spotlight and features the word \"Glue\" in a large, black, sans-serif font on its upper half. Below the text is a color photograph of a short, cylindrical, metallic-looking object with a hole in its center, resting on a dark, gridded surface.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, indoor setting, two posters hang from binder clips against a black background. The poster on the left is white and brightly illuminated by a spotlight. It displays the word \"Glue\" in bold, black letters above a photograph of a reflective, cylindrical object with a central hole. To the right, a second poster is mostly in shadow, showing a black rectangular space. Light-colored lines are visible in the background from which the posters are suspended.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
