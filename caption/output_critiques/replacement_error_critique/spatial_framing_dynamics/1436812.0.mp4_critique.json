    "pre_caption": "The video uses an extreme wide shot to capture a vast canyon landscape from an aerial perspective. The winding road is positioned in the lower left and center of the frame, occupying the foreground and middle ground as it curves along the edge of the plateau. The steep cliffs and rocky terrain extend from the bottom left to the center and right, also in the foreground and middle ground. Sparse green vegetation and clusters of trees are scattered along the cliff edges and slopes, mainly in the middle ground and lower half of the frame. The wide river appears in the upper right and center background, running parallel to the cliffs and bordered by additional plateaus and rolling hills that stretch across the top and upper right of the frame. The camera is positioned high above the landscape, looking down from an elevated angle, and remains steady throughout, maintaining a consistent spatial relationship between the elements. No major subjects are present, and the shot emphasizes the scale and layout of the natural scenery.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a landscape scenery shot, capturing an aerial view of a dramatic canyon with rugged, sunlit cliffs and a winding road that curves gracefully along the edge of the plateau. The terrain is characterized by sparse vegetation, with patches of green trees accentuating the contours of the land. In the distance, a wide river glimmers under soft daylight, bordered by layered hills and expansive valleys.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone shows an expansive outdoor landscape during daylight, featuring a winding paved road that curves dramatically atop a high, rocky plateau with steep cliffs. The terrain is mostly covered in patches of green shrubs and clusters of trees along the cliff edges and lower slopes. In the middleground, a wide river with calm blue water flows parallel to the cliffs, bordered by additional plateaus and rolling hills that stretch into the distance. The sky is clear, and the lighting suggests early morning or late afternoon, casting soft shadows across the scene. A few vehicles are visible on the road, their shapes and colors contrasting with the natural earth tones of the environment. No overlays or digital elements are present in the video.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
