    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective, a rifle is held in the bottom-center foreground. The scene initially frames a large column on the left in the middle ground, with a walkway extending into the center. The camera pans slightly to the right and then moves forward along the walkway. As it advances, the building with its columns occupies the left side of the frame, while dense bushes on the right remain in the middle ground. The rifle stays fixed in the bottom-center foreground throughout the movement. Various heads-up display elements are positioned around the screen: a compass is at the top-center, an objective marker is on the left, the main objective text is in the top-center background, and a \"Checkpoint reached\" notification briefly appears in the top-left. The camera maintains a character's eye-level height.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A first-person perspective from a video game shows a player character holding a modern assault rifle equipped with a holographic sight. The character's hands are covered in light-colored gloves. The entire scene is rendered in a green-tinted night vision mode. On-screen text displays the objective \"Find Hadir.\" A waypoint marker on the left indicates a location named \"Search Church\" at a distance of 114 meters. A compass is visible at the top of the screen, and a \"Checkpoint reached\" notification appears briefly.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves through a dark, outdoor location at night, with the entire scene cast in a monochromatic green hue from a night vision perspective. The camera proceeds along a stone walkway that runs alongside a large building featuring prominent columns and windows. To the right of the path are dense bushes and trees. The character's gloved hands and a rifle with a sight are visible at the bottom of the view. Several heads-up display elements are overlaid on the screen, including a compass at the top, an objective marker on the left indicating 'Search Church' at a distance, and a primary objective stating 'Find Hadir.' A 'Checkpoint reached' notification briefly appears.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
