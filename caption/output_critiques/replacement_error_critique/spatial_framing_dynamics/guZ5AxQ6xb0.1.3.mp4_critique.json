    "pre_caption": "In a full shot captured from below the subject, a surfer is positioned in the center-right of the frame, situated in the middle ground. The surfer is viewed through the translucent, turbulent water of a wave's barrel, which occupies the foreground and the top half of the frame. The surfboard extends from the surfer's position towards the bottom-left corner. The bottom portion of the frame is filled with churning, foamy water. Throughout the shot, the surfer and surfboard maintain their general position while moving slightly within the dynamic, shifting water.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From an underwater perspective inside a breaking wave, a person in a dark, full-body outfit is seen surfing. Their figure is blurred and distorted by the turbulent water. The surfer is standing on a dark-colored surfboard, the underside of which is visible, revealing at least two black fins as it moves across the water.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An underwater view from inside the barrel of a large, breaking ocean wave captures a surfer in motion. The water is a translucent blue, with bright sunlight illuminating the scene from above, filtering through the curved, bubbly surface of the wave. A silhouetted figure on a dark surfboard with visible fins glides through the water. The water's surface is textured and distorted, while the area below the board is darker and more turbulent with white foam. The seawater churns vigorously, creating swirling patterns and eddies that add to the dynamic energy of the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned below the subject.",
