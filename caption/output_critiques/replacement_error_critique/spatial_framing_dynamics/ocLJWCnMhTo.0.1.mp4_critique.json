    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a bird's-eye view, looking straight down at a black-and-white checkered floor that fills the frame. A figure in a white shirt is positioned at the bottom of the frame, while a second figure is partially visible at the top right. A reflective disc with a glowing golden ring is located in the center of the shot, with a metallic chair in the top left. As the camera cranes and tilts, the perspective gradually shifts, causing the entire scene to rotate until it becomes completely inverted. In the final upside-down composition, the checkered floor occupies the top of the frame, and the figure initially at the bottom is now seen inverted at the top. The central disc now appears to hang from the \"ceiling,\" and a red stream of light flows from it toward the bottom of the frame, where the room's walls and framed pictures become visible in the background. The camera's position changes from being high above the subjects to a lower, inverted angle.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The scene begins with a standard overhead view that gradually shifts to an inverted perspective. On the black-and-white checkered floor, two figures in white short-sleeved shirts are visible: one is light-skinned with short blond hair, and the other has darker skin, visible only from the shoulders down, wearing a silver wrist accessory similar to a watch strap. At the center of the composition is a reflective silver disc, reminiscent of a mirror, surrounded by a glowing golden light effect. A red, ribbon-like stream of light flows between the two figures.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place in an indoor room with a distinctive black and white checkerboard floor, beginning as an overhead view and craning up into an inverted perspective. The walls are a mix of white and green tiles, with a couple of framed pictures visible. Metallic chairs are present in the space. A reflective silver disc resembling a mirror is encircled by a glowing golden ring of light. Figures in white short-sleeved shirts are positioned around the room. A red ribbon-like flow of light extends between the figures. The footage has a grainy, low-fidelity aesthetic.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a bird’s-eye view, looking straight down at a tiled floor with figures and objects arranged below. As the camera cranes, the perspective gradually shifts until the scene flips into an upside-down angle, inverting the composition. The checkered floor dominates the background, while figures and objects remain visible. Two people are wearing white shirts. The woman in the far shows her full body initially, while another person on the right only show part of their body.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject and then changes to at the subject's level.",
