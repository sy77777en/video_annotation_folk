    "pre_caption": "This video presents a static wide shot of a city square, focusing on the scenery. A large, white cathedral is centered in the background, framed by trees. A black iron fence with a central gate spans the middle ground, with art displays attached to it—paintings on the left and photographs on the right. A seated artist is positioned in the left middle ground next to the paintings. In the foreground, a man walks from the left side of the frame toward the center along a paved walkway. The camera is positioned at a standard height and remains stationary, capturing the entire scene without any movement or change in framing.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a cityscape scene on an overcast day, focusing on the ambiance of a street with a grand, white cathedral featuring classical architecture in the background, framed by a black iron fence. The fence serves as an open-air gallery, with one side displaying colorful paintings next to a seated artist under a small red umbrella. The artist, seen from behind, wears a black hat, a black shirt, jeans, and brown shoes. The other side of the fence features a collection of photographs, some in black and white and others in color. In the foreground, a man in a hat, blue jacket, and brown pants walks along the sidewalk, passing by the art displays. The camera's wide, static perspective captures the overall environment and atmosphere, distributing focus across the architecture, the street culture of the artists, and the passersby to create a rich sense of place, rather than highlighting a single focal point.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene unfolds at a square in a city on an overcast day, with the white facade of a cathedral visible in the background. A black wrought-iron fence separates the cathedral grounds from a paved walkway where artwork is displayed. To the left of a central gate, colorful paintings, including portraits of animals, are hung on the fence, where a person sits in a folding chair next to a small red umbrella. To the right, a collection of black-and-white photographs is arranged. A man in a tan hat and blue jacket walks across the foreground, passing between the two art displays. Bare-branched and evergreen trees frame the cathedral.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
