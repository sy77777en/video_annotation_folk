    "pre_caption": "This is a full shot from inside a refrigerator, with the camera positioned at a person's level, looking out. A large, round glass bowl sits in the center of the frame, occupying the foreground and middle ground. Inside the bowl, a dark shoe is submerged at the bottom center. In the background, a red bottle is visible in the top left, and green vegetables are at the top. A plastic container is in the bottom left foreground. Initially, a reflection of a person wearing a beanie is seen in the top center of the bowl's surface. The person then opens the refrigerator door, and their figure appears more clearly in the background, framed by the opening of the bowl in the top center. They lean forward into the middle ground, their reflection growing larger, before reaching for an item and beginning to move back as the door starts to close.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The central focus is a large, round glass bowl, resembling a fishbowl, situated on a wire shelf inside a refrigerator. This bowl is filled with water, containing a submerged dark blue or black high-top sneaker with a white tag on its side. Small pieces of green moss are also present in the water. A young man with light skin, wearing a dark beanie and a black jacket, is initially seen as a reflection on the bowl's surface. He opens the refrigerator door, leans in to look at the contents, and then reaches for an item before starting to close the door.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a perspective inside a refrigerator, a large, round glass fishbowl rests on a wire shelf. Submerged in the water within the bowl is a dark-colored high-top sneaker, accompanied by small clumps of green moss. The curved glass of the bowl reflects a person wearing a dark beanie, who is looking into the refrigerator. The scene is illuminated by a cool, blue-toned light, revealing other items on the shelves, such as a red bottle and green vegetables in a drawer above.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This video shows a full shot of a round glass object inside a refrigerator, containing water, a shoe, and some small plants. The camera is positioned inside the refrigerator, facing the door of it. A person then opens the refrigerator, takes some items, and is about to close the door.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
