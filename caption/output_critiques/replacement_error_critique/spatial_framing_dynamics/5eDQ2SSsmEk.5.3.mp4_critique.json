    "pre_caption": "The video displays an extreme close-up shot of a textured surface, likely paper, with handwritten numbers. The shot size remains consistent throughout, focusing tightly on the details of the surface. The numbers \"87,000\" and \"90,000\" are positioned towards the center-left of the frame, with the latter becoming more prominent as the camera slightly shifts. These numbers are in the foreground, while the icy texture and reflective particles are scattered across the entire frame, creating depth. The camera maintains a steady height relative to the surface, capturing the intricate details without any noticeable change in angle. The bluish lighting enhances the contrast, keeping the focus on the numbers and the icy texture. There are no significant changes in the spatial position of the elements; they remain static within the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a close-up view of a red, textured surface resembling paper or fabric, with handwritten numbers prominently displayed. The numbers \"87,000\" and \"90,000\" are visible, written in bold, black ink. The surface appears to be wet, adding a glistening effect. The lighting casts a bluish tint over the scene, enhancing the contrast between the red background and the black writing. The focus is on the numbers and the wet texture, creating a visually striking composition.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a close-up view of a textured surface, possibly paper, with handwritten numbers and text. The setting is indoors, with a focus on the material's surface, which is marked by dark ink and appears to be slightly crumpled. The lighting is low, casting a bluish tint over the scene, creating a contrast with the reddish hue of the paper. The surface is speckled with what looks like small, reflective particles, adding a shimmering effect. The numbers \"87,000\" and \"90,000\" are prominently visible, suggesting a focus on these details. The overall atmosphere is intimate and detailed, emphasizing the texture and markings on the paper.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: Lacking background information, making it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",
