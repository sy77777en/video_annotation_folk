    "pre_caption": "A woman is captured in a full shot, positioned in the center foreground on a surfboard that occupies the bottom of the frame. The camera is at her level. Initially, a wave curls around her in the middle ground, and a distant, tree-covered coastline is visible in the background at the top left under a cloudy sky. As she surfs, the entire frame, which is locked onto the board, rotates approximately 90 degrees counter-clockwise. During this rotation, the woman remains in the center of the frame, while the background coastline shifts to the top right, and the horizon line becomes vertically oriented along the right edge of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with light skin and wet, blonde hair is shown surfing on a white surfboard. She is wearing a bright pink bikini top and patterned bikini bottoms. She is crouched low on the board, balancing with her arms extended out to her sides as she rides a wave, creating a large splash of white water around her. The camera captures a full shot, initially positioned at a level angle, then briefly shifts to a high angle before returning to a level angle, rotated 90 degrees.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot, with the camera mounted to the front of a surfboard, captures a ride on a large, curling ocean wave during the day. The water is a deep blue-green, with white foam and spray splashing around the board. In the background, a distant coastline covered in green trees is visible under a partly cloudy sky. A person wearing a pink bikini is balanced on the white surfboard, which is cutting through the water.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
