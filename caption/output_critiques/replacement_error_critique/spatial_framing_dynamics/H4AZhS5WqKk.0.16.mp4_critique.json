    "pre_caption": "In a static wide shot, the scene is framed from an exterior perspective, looking through a dark window frame that occupies the foreground. In the middle ground, positioned on the windowsill in the bottom center of the frame, an animated mouse stands between a bowl of olives on the bottom left and a coupe glass on the bottom right. The interior of the apartment is visible in the background. The mouse reaches to its left, picks up a skewer of olives, and tosses them into the air directly above its head before catching them, with the olives moving from the bottom left, up into the center of the frame, and back down. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features an animated mouse standing on a windowsill. The mouse is anthropomorphic, with large ears, a small nose, and a tail, holding a stick in one hand. It is positioned between a bowl of green olives and a tall goblet containing a clear liquid. Initially, the mouse faces sideways to the camera and only turns to face the viewer at the end. The mouse's expression is alert, and its atypical, cartoon-like appearance is the main focus.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents an urban nighttime scene, focusing on a high-rise building in a bustling city. The setting is with a view of a dimly lit apartment exterior, where one window glows warmly, contrasting with the dark facade. The cityscape in the background is illuminated by numerous lights from other buildings, indicating a lively urban environment. Inside the lit apartment, visible through the window, is a cozy interior with a bed and a small table. A glass and some green olives are placed on the ledge. It appears to be raining outside, with occasional lightning illuminating the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with an extreme wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
