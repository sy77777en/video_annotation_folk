    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a full shot of a man standing in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground of a parking garage. He then walks directly toward the camera, moving from the middle ground into the foreground. As he approaches, the framing transitions into a medium-full shot, showing him from the head to his thighs, while he remains centered in the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned man with a full head of medium-length brown hair, a beard, and a mustache stands facing forward. He is wearing a black tank top and black pants. He holds a knife in his right hand, with the blade pointing downwards, and has a serious or intense expression.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene unfolds in an indoor parking garage, characterized by its concrete construction. Rectangular concrete pillars support the low ceiling, from which numerous pipes and fluorescent light fixtures are suspended. The concrete floor is marked with yellow painted lines, delineating parking spaces. The overall illumination is provided by these artificial lights, casting a utilitarian glow throughout the expansive, empty area. A man, dressed in dark clothing, stands centrally in one of the wide lanes between rows of potential parking spots.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
