    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium-long shot capturing the reflection of a hunched person, positioned in the middle ground, slightly left of center. In the background center, a vertical strip of white light illuminates a wall section featuring a wire hanger and a small shelf. A large, dark silhouette dominates the right foreground. The camera pans right, transitioning to a medium shot that frames the upper body of a hunched person directly, now located in the middle ground towards the right side of the frame. Red curtains are visible in the background right, near a circular drying rack. A dark silhouette now occupies the left foreground. Throughout the shot, the camera maintains a position level with the subject.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In the video, a person is depicted in a dimly lit room with prominent red lighting. Initially, the person is seen mostly as a reflection in the mirror, hunched over. The view then pans to show the person's upper body directly, with their hands resting on a table as if attempting to stand up. The low lighting obscures detailed features, rendering the person largely as a silhouette.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures the interior of a room where soft daylight filters through the curtains, tinting the incoming light with a subtle red hue, creating a dark atmosphere. A single, vertical strip of white light cuts through the dimness, illuminating a section of a wall where a wire clothes hanger hangs and a small shelf holds indistinct items. In the background, red curtains cover the balcony window, a  circular clothes hanger is also attached to the clothesline is also attached to the clothesline. Silhouetted figure and the objects on the table beside him occupy the foreground and midground, contributing to the sparsely furnished appearance of the space.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a person hunched over in a dimly lit room, seemingly injured. It begins with a shot of the reflection in a mirror, displaying nearly the entire body of the person. As the camera pans right, it reveals the person's upper body in the real scene.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
