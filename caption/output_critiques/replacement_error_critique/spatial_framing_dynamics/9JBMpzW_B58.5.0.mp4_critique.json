    "pre_caption": "This video presents a static, extreme wide shot of a seascape captured from a high-angle perspective on a container ship. The ship's deck, filled with containers, occupies the bottom half of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground. The ocean fills the horizontal center of the scene, stretching from the middle ground to the background horizon. The sky populates the top half of the frame in the background, where dark clouds are seen in a time-lapse moving rapidly across the stationary stars. A yellow glow is positioned on the right side of the frame along the background horizon, while a green airglow is visible in the upper left of the sky. Text and logo overlays are fixed in the center-right of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a dramatic time-lapse seascape captured at night from the bow of a large container ship. The composition emphasizes the immense scale of the environment, making the atmosphere the primary focus rather than a specific subject. The foreground is occupied by rows of shipping containers, leading the eye out towards the vast, dark ocean that meets a star-filled sky. Dark clouds drift rapidly across the celestial expanse, which is illuminated by a bright yellow glow on the distant horizon and a subtle green airglow, creating a breathtaking and dynamic nocturnal scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high vantage point on a container ship at sea, a time-lapse captures the night sky. A vast expanse of stars is visible between dark, fast-moving clouds. A bright yellow glow illuminates the horizon on the right, while a faint greenish hue is present in the upper left sky. In the foreground, the deck of the ship is laden with rows of shipping containers. The dark ocean stretches out ahead toward the horizon. Overlays on the right side of the screen display the text \"JEFFREY.HK\" next to an Instagram logo and \"JEFFHK\" next to a YouTube logo.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
