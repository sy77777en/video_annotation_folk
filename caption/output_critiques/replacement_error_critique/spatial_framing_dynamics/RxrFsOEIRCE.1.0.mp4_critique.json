    "pre_caption": "The video begins with an extreme wide shot, where a light brown, unpaved path occupies the foreground center, extending into the middle ground. Rolling green fields flank the path on both the left and right, stretching from the foreground to the background. A prominent group of green trees is positioned in the middle ground left, with additional scattered trees and a more distant tree line visible in the background. The bright blue sky, dotted with white clouds, fills the top portion of the frame in the background. As the camera moves forward along the path, the foreground elements, including the path and the immediately adjacent fields, continuously recede towards the middle ground and background, while new sections of the path and landscape enter the foreground. The trees initially in the middle ground left shift further left and towards the background as the camera advances.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a landscape scenery shot. There is no main subject because the focus is on capturing the expansive rural environment, characterized by rolling green fields, scattered trees, a dirt path, and a bright blue sky with fluffy white clouds, emphasizing the atmosphere and scale of the natural setting rather than a specific object or entity. The rapid movement further contributes to an immersive experience of the landscape itself.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a daytime journey along a light brown, unpaved path that winds through a sunlit rural landscape. The scene is characterized by rolling green fields, some appearing as cultivated land and others as grassy meadows, under a bright blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds. Groups of green, leafy trees are scattered throughout, bordering the fields and path, with the drone's forward movement creating a sense of progression through this pastoral setting.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
