    "pre_caption": "A man is captured in a full shot, positioned in the center-right of the foreground from an initial high-angle perspective. He is surrounded by snow-covered trees that occupy the middle ground and background, filling the upper and side portions of the frame, while the snowy slope extends from the foreground into the middle ground. As the man snowboards forward and down the slope, the camera, which is attached to him, moves with him. During this forward motion, the camera's height transitions from being positioned above the subject to being at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man is snowboarding down a snowy slope, captured from a high-angle, forward-facing perspective. He wears a blue and olive green hooded winter jacket, a black vest-shaped harness in front of his chest, and olive green snow pants. On his head is a grey beanie with a red stripe, and he is wearing large, dark-lensed ski goggles with an orange and black strap. He also has on black gloves and a black backpack. The man is leaning back on his snowboard, which has a blue and black design on its surface, as he carves through the powder, raising up snow.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A selfie POV shot captures a snowboarder moving down a steep, snow-covered mountainside during the day. The wide-angle perspective shows the person carving through deep powder snow, which sprays up from the board. The setting is a dense forest of tall, thin coniferous trees, each heavily coated in a thick layer of white snow. The ground is completely covered in untouched powder, and the sky above is bright and overcast. The snowboarder is wearing a blue and green jacket under a black vest-shaped harness, a grey beanie with a red stripe, and goggles with an orange-tinted lens.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",
