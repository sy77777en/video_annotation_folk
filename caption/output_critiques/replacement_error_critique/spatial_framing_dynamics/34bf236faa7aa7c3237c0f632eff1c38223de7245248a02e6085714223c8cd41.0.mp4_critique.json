    "pre_caption": "This close-up, overhead shot centers on a light-colored basin filled with water, which occupies most of the frame. In the middle ground, various colorful flowers float scattered across the water's surface, initially positioned in the top left, top center, left-center, bottom right-center, bottom right, right-center, and bottom center areas. Green grass is visible in the background around the top edge of the basin. A hand enters the frame from the bottom left foreground, holding a flower. It moves towards the bottom center and places the flower onto the water in the middle ground. The hand then retracts slightly before moving towards the bottom right-center, where it briefly touches a purple flower floating in the middle ground. Finally, the hand exits the frame towards the bottom left. The flowers drift slightly on the water throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a light-colored, round basin filled with water, in which numerous colorful flowers are floating. These flowers include varieties in pink, orange, yellow, purple, white/cream, and dark red, resembling roses, marigolds, clematis, and daisies, scattered across the water's surface alongside a single pink petal. A light-skinned human hand, wearing a ring, appears in the video. It first gently places a white and pink speckled rose onto the water, then withdraws in the direction it came from. The rose drifts toward the lower left with the rippling current. A few seconds later, the hand reenters the frame from the lower left and picks up the purple clematis flower.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An overhead POV shot shows a light-colored, round basin resting on green grass outdoors during the daytime. The basin is filled with water, upon which float several colorful flowers, including orange, pink, purple, and yellow blooms, along with a single pink petal. A hand enters the view, gently places a pinkish-white and pink speckled rose onto the water's surface, and later reaches towards a purple flower already floating among the others. The flowers drift slightly in the water throughout the video.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
