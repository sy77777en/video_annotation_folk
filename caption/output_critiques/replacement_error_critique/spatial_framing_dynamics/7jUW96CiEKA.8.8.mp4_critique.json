    "pre_caption": "In a static shot taken from above, a crocodile is positioned horizontally across the bottom of the frame, occupying about 60% of its width. Its front half rests on a sandy bank in the foreground, with its head near the bottom left, while its tail is submerged in the water to the right. A small clump of earth sits on the bank in the left foreground. In the middle ground, a second crocodile is partially visible in the upper right of the frame, swimming in the calm, green water that fills the center and background. The upper portion of the frame is filled with the blurry reflection of green reeds from the distant shore.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In the middle ground, a light greenish-brown crocodile with scaly skin lies at the water's edge, with the front half of its body resting on a muddy bank and its tail submerged. It is oriented towards the left, and a small, dark object is floating on the water beside the crocodile. Further back in the calm, green water, a second crocodile is stationary and floating, with only the top of its head, bumpy back, and tail visible above the surface.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a sunlit, natural setting, a small, light-green crocodile with dark markings rests at the edge of a calm body of water, its body half on the sandy bank and half submerged. A second, similar crocodile remains still in the greenish water, its back and snout breaking the surface. The water reflects the blurry, tall green reeds that line the distant bank. Beside the first stationary crocodile, a small ball floats on the water. To the left, a small clump of earth and sparse vegetation sits on the shoreline.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video captures crocodiles in a lake from the shore. The crocodile close to the camera has about half of its body above the water, occupying 60% of the frame's width, with the rest submerged. In the distance, another crocodile is visible, with only a small portion of its body above the water.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
