    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot of a gymnast positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground as she executes a flip. The camera, positioned at her level, dynamically tilts and rotates to follow her movement, causing the background gym apparatus to spin and blur. As she moves through the air, her body travels from the center toward the top of the frame. The shot then cuts to a stable view of the gymnast standing in the center-right of the frame, still in the middle ground, with her arms raised. A blue floor mat with a red border occupies the foreground and middle ground, while various pieces of gymnastics equipment are visible in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A Black woman with a muscular build is shown performing a gymnastics routine. Her long, black hair is styled in a high ponytail. She is dressed in a grey sports bra and black shorts, and she wears small white earbuds. Throughout the sequence, she is seen in various dynamic poses, flipping through the air.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place inside a spacious gymnastics training facility under bright, even lighting. A large blue floor mat with red and white boundary lines covers the ground. In the background, various pieces of gymnastics apparatus are visible, including balance beams and uneven bars with blue and red elements. Rolled-up mats are stored against a light grey wall, which features a grid-like pattern on its upper section.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
