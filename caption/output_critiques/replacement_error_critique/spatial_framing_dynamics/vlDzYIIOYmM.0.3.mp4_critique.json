    "pre_caption": "The video presents a dynamic medium shot of the main snowboarder, who initially occupies the center-left foreground. As he moves, his framing fluctuates, sometimes tightening to a medium close-up focusing on his head and shoulders, then relaxing back to a medium shot showing more of his upper body, while he generally stays in the central foreground due to the selfie perspective. Snow-covered evergreen trees are visible in the middle ground, appearing on the left and right sides and rushing past, as well as in the background further up the slope. Another snowboarder is briefly seen in the background center, moving towards the background left. Powdery snow covers the ground in the foreground, middle ground, and background, with plumes spraying into the foreground and middle ground around the main snowboarder. A bright, partially cloudy sky occupies the top background. The camera maintains a position at the subject's level throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man in a yellow and black hooded jacket is snowboarding. He wears a dark beanie with a \"Red Bull\" logo and a GoPro camera mounted on top. He has large, reflective ski goggles on, and his mouth is open with his tongue slightly visible, showing a focused expression. In the background, another person, also wearing a yellow jacket, can be seen snowboarding further up the slope.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A selfie POV shot, where the camera is facing the person holding it, shows a dynamic descent through a sunlit, snowy mountain environment. The outdoor scene unfolds during the daytime, with a bright, partially cloudy sky visible above. Tall evergreen trees, their branches heavily laden with white snow, populate the sloping terrain. The ground is entirely covered in a deep layer of powdery white snow, which billows and sprays as the perspective moves rapidly downhill. In the background, another figure is briefly visible moving through the same snowy conditions.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subject’s framing (shot size) is not stable** throughout the video, so the description should emphasize this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
