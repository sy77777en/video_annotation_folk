    "pre_caption": "A medium shot frames a man in the left foreground, with a paved path in the middle ground and a forest in the background. The man swings a tennis racket from the left toward the center of the frame. A red bell pepper appears in the center foreground, positioned on the racket. As the racket continues its swing across the frame to the right, the pepper explodes in the center foreground, sending a cloud of red fragments scattering primarily toward the left and bottom of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young man with light skin, wearing a blue short-sleeved t-shirt, black shorts, and a gray baseball cap, swings a black and red tennis racket with white strings. The video captures the moment the racket strikes a whole, bright red bell pepper, causing it to explode into a cloud of small red pieces and seeds.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place outdoors on a concrete path in a jungle setting, under bright sunlight, suggesting it is around dusk. A person in a blue t-shirt and black shorts swings a tennis racket with a dark red frame and white strings. A vibrant red bell pepper is struck by the racket, shattering into a spray of small red fragments and pulp that disperses into the air. Clearly defined tree shadows on the ground indicate the area is well-lit by ample sunlight.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
