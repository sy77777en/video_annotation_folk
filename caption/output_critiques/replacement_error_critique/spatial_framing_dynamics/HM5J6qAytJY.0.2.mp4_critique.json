    "pre_caption": "This video is presented as a first-person point-of-view shot from the driver's seat of a race car. In the immediate foreground, the driver's hands and a steering wheel are centered in the bottom half of the frame. A white roll cage is visible in the bottom left and bottom right corners, also in the foreground. The car's dashboard and a central digital display occupy the middle ground, just above the steering wheel. Through the windshield, a road extends from the bottom center into the background, flanked by a desert landscape in the middle ground. In the background, mountains are visible on the horizon, with the sun positioned in the top left of the frame. The entire car moves forward, causing the exterior scenery to rush from the background toward the foreground, while the driver's hands make slight turning adjustments on the steering wheel. The camera is positioned at the driver's eye level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video shows a first-person perspective from inside a race car, looking out the front windshield. A person's arms, clad in a white racing suit and white gloves with black accents, are visible holding a black, yoke-style racing steering wheel. The steering wheel has a silver Mercedes-Benz logo at its center and is equipped with numerous multi-colored buttons and dials. The car's interior is stripped down, featuring a white structural roll cage with crisscrossing bars on both the left and right sides. A small digital display screen, showing vehicle data, is mounted on the dashboard in the center. Through the windshield, a paved road stretches forward through a flat, arid landscape with mountains visible in the distance under a clear sky, illuminated by the golden light of a sun low on the horizon.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures the view from inside a race car driving on a paved track through a desert landscape at sunset. The interior of the car features a white, crisscrossing roll cage, and a driver's hands in white gloves are visible on a complex racing steering wheel with a Mercedes-Benz logo. A digital dashboard is mounted in the center of the console. Through the windshield, the sun hangs low on the horizon, casting a warm light over the flat, arid terrain and distant mountains as the car moves forward.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
