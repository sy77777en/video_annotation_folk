    "pre_caption": "This medium shot follows a woman from behind, keeping her centered in the frame as she walks through a flower farm. She is positioned in the middle ground, carrying a bucket of flowers. The path she walks on is flanked by rows of green plants and flowers on the left and right, which extend from the foreground into the middle ground. In the background, a line of trees stands before a distant mountain range. The camera moves with her, maintaining a position at her level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with long brown hair tied in a ponytail is shown from behind. She wears a dusty pink tank top, dark shorts, and a light-colored baseball cap worn facing forward. She is walking and carrying a large, black, cylindrical bucket in her left arm, which is filled with a large bouquet of long-stemmed, light-colored flowers and green foliage.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A woman viewed from behind walks through a large outdoor flower farm, carrying a black bucket filled with light-colored flowers. The path winds through a blend of green foliage and flower beds, with tall plants and pale flowers interspersed throughout the scene. In the distance, beyond more rows of yellow and red flowers, a line of evergreen trees stands before a hazy mountain range under an overcast sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
