    "pre_caption": "This video is a scenery shot capturing a large cathedral. Initially, a low-angle wide shot frames the ornate facade, which occupies the center and right portions of the frame in the middle ground. A portion of another building is visible on the far left, with a deep blue sky in the background at the top of the frame. The camera then executes a slow, continuous upward tilt while panning slightly to the right. This movement shifts the composition, causing the building on the left to move out of the frame and bringing the upper, more detailed sections of the cathedral's central facade, including its large rose window, into full view. The shot concludes with the upper-central part of the facade filling the majority of the frame from a more pronounced low angle.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video is an architectural scenery shot, capturing a low-angle, panning view across the highly ornate facade of a massive cathedral. There is no single main subject, as the camera's deliberate movement across the vast, detailed surface is intended to convey the overwhelming scale and artistic complexity of the entire structure. The focus is on the grandeur of the environment itself, showcasing the building's intricate polychrome marble work in shades of white, green, and light brown, set against a brilliant, clear blue sky. The Gothic facade is densely decorated with pointed arches, numerous statues set within elaborate niches, detailed carvings, and large, circular rose windows, creating a powerful impression of historical and artistic significance.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides an upward-tilting view of the ornate facade of the Florence Cathedral under a clear, deep blue sky during the day. The Gothic structure is adorned with a polychrome marble pattern of white and green. The intricate facade features multiple pointed arches, detailed carvings, and large circular rose windows. Statues are situated in niches across the building's front, with a prominent relief sculpture and a mosaic positioned above the central arched entrance. In the middle of the video, a portion of another building is visible to the left in the city square.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

It begins with a low-angle wide shot that highlights the ornate facade, positioned in the center and right portions of the frame against a deep blue sky. On the far left, a portion of another building is visible. The camera then moves forward and slightly to the right, altering the composition by removing the building on the left from view and revealing the intricate upper sections of the cathedral's central facade, including its impressive rose window. The video concludes with the central part of the facade dominating the frame from a more subtle low angle.",
