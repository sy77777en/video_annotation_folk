    "pre_caption": "This is a medium full shot featuring a person in a spacesuit positioned slightly left of the center in the foreground/middle ground. The subject faces towards the right side of the frame. In the background, stacked horizontal layers fill the middle, right, and far-left portions of the frame. A reflective floor occupies the bottom of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level and remains static, with no changes in framing or subject position during the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a person wearing a space suit, characterized by a helmet and a dark, padded jacket with light-colored stripes. The suit includes gloves and pants that match the jacket's color scheme. The person is oriented with their back to the viewer, leaning slightly forward with arms extended, suggesting movement or interaction with something out of view. The setting appears to be a dimly lit, enclosed space with reflective surfaces, enhancing the futuristic and technical appearance of the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows an indoor setting characterized by a dark, abstract environment. The walls are composed of numerous stacked, horizontal layers with varying colors and textures, creating a dense, library-like or data-storage appearance. Lighting is predominantly dim, with isolated brighter areas illuminating parts of the background structures. A figure wearing a grey and white spacesuit, complete with a helmet, stands facing away from the viewer towards the right. The suit features a dark jacket over lighter pants and white harness straps. The figure's left arm is slightly outstretched.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
