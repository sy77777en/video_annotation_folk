    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot capturing a woman in a dynamic action pose, mid-air in a stadium setting. She is positioned centrally in the frame, with the stadium and spectators forming the background. The camera captures her from a low angle, emphasizing her leap against the clear sky. The scene transitions to a cozy bedroom, where a close-up shot focuses on a wooden bedside table in the foreground. The table holds a framed photo of the woman in action, a white lamp, and an alarm clock. The background features softly lit string lights and a plush toy on a bed with light green sheets, creating a warm atmosphere. The transition links the dynamic outdoor action with the intimate indoor setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a woman with dark skin and black hair in a dynamic action pose, wearing a blue soccer jersey with the number 9, white shorts, and red socks. She is captured mid-air in a stadium setting, suggesting she is playing soccer. Her hair is tied back, and she appears to be leaping or kicking. The scene transitions to a cozy bedroom where a framed photo of the same woman in action is placed on a wooden bedside table next to a white lamp. The room is softly lit, with string lights visible in the background, creating a warm and personal atmosphere.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video begins in an outdoor stadium during the day, showcasing a soccer player in mid-air against a backdrop of a clear sky and a large, modern stadium filled with spectators. The scene transitions to a cozy bedroom with soft lighting, where a wooden bedside table holds a white lamp, an alarm clock, and a framed photo of the soccer player, linking the two environments. The room is adorned with string lights, a plush toy on the bed, and light green bed sheets, creating a warm and personal atmosphere that enhances the overall aesthetic.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of a woman arching in a soccer field. As the camera moves backward, it becomes apparent that the scene is within a picture frame that appears to move. The camera continues to pull back, revealing the picture frame resting on a small table in a bedroom.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: \nThe camera initially seems to be positioned below the woman soccer player as she arcs in the air. However, as the video reveals the picture frame is moving while resting on a table in the bedroom, it becomes evident that the camera is actually level with the picture frame.",
