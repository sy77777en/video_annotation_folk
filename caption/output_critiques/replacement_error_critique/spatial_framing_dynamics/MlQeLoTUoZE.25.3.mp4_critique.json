    "pre_caption": "The scene begins with a medium over-the-shoulder shot, with a translucent blue woman positioned in the right foreground, her back to the camera. A man in green armor stands in the left-center of the frame, located in the middle ground, facing her. In the background, the indistinct shapes of vehicles are visible within a dimly lit hangar. The armored man then walks forward, moving toward the viewpoint and the woman. As he advances, the framing transitions into a medium close-up, showing him from the chest up and making him more dominant in the frame. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level throughout the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man in bulky, green, metallic armor stands holding a large, dark-colored rifle. His head is completely enclosed in a helmet with a reflective orange visor, and the armor shows signs of damage and wear. He faces a woman who is seen from behind. Her body is translucent and glows with a blue light, with intricate patterns of light, resembling circuitry, visible on her back and neck. She has short, dark blue hair cut in a bob. The man in armor walks closer to the woman during the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An over-the-shoulder POV, where the camera is positioned behind a character, shows their upper body and the scene ahead within a dimly lit, futuristic indoor space resembling a hangar. The environment features dark, metallic walls and structural elements, with the indistinct shapes of vehicles visible in the background. Facing the viewpoint is a figure clad in green, scuffed metallic armor with a reflective orange visor, holding a large, dark weapon. The back of the foreground character, who has short, dark hair, is translucent blue and marked with glowing, circuit-like patterns. During the scene, the armored figure takes several steps forward.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
