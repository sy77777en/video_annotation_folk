    "pre_caption": "This close-up shot features a person, seen from a side-rear view, primarily occupying the left and central area of the frame and positioned in the foreground to middle ground. They hold a dark green phone to their right ear; the phone is located in the center-left of the frame, also in the foreground to middle ground. To the right and slightly behind the person, a computer monitor is visible on the right side of the frame, situated in the middle ground to background. The camera maintains a position at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person with brown, wavy hair and light skin, wearing a light-colored t-shirt, is shown from a side-rear view. They are holding a compact, dark green, rectangular phone with rounded edges to their right ear; the phone's earpiece and a small, dark, circular indentation on its back near the top are visible. To the right and slightly behind the person, a portion of a dark computer monitor is visible, its screen displaying an indistinct interface. The entire scene is illuminated by a strong yellowish-green light, affecting the coloration of all subjects.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An objective POV shot captures an indoor scene illuminated by a distinct yellowish-green light. A person with brown, wavy hair is depicted from the back and side, holding a small, dark green, rectangular phone to their ear. To the right, a computer monitor is visible, displaying a complex, light-colored interface against a dark background. A small text overlay displaying \"27\" is located in the very bottom left corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
