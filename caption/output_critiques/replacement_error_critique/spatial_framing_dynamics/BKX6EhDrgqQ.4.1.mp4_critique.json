    "pre_caption": "In a full shot captured at the subjects' level, a line of stylized figures occupies the middle ground, stretching from the right side of the frame towards the left. At the front of the line, a kiosk is positioned in the right middle ground. A text overlay is fixed in the bottom-left foreground. During the scene, the figure at the far-left end of the line, located in the left middle ground, turns and walks out of the frame to the left. The other figures in the line and the kiosk remain stationary throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A line of stylized, low-polygon human figures stands on a tiled floor, waiting to use a kiosk. The figures, all rendered in a uniform light gray, include several men and one woman. The woman, at the front of the line, wears a skirt and high heels. Behind her, five men, all approximately the same height and evenly spaced, stand still. From right to left, the sequence is as follows: a man with his arms crossed, a man carrying a shoulder bag, a taller man with his hands in his pockets, another man with his arms crossed, and a man wearing a hoodie with his hands in his pockets. At the back of the line, another male figure walks to the end and then turns away from the queue. The white, rectangular kiosk at the head of the line stands on a black base and features a large screen displaying a hamburger ordering service. A white text box with the words \"up to 70% leave\" is visible in the lower-left corner.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a minimalist, monochromatic indoor setting with a light gray tiled floor, a line of stylized, low-poly human figures waits. The figures, all rendered in shades of gray, stand facing a tall, white, rectangular kiosk at the front of the queue. The kiosk features a large white screen displaying a hamburger ordering service. During the scene, a figure at the end of the line steps back and turns away. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays the text \"up to 70% leave\" in black font within a white box, alongside a small white overlay with the text \"[27]\".**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
