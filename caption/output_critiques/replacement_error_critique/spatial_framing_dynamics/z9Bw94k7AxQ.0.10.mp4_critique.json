    "pre_caption": "In a medium tracking shot, a man is consistently framed in the center of the screen and occupies the middle ground. He walks directly away from the camera, moving deeper into the background down a narrow alley. The alley walls are positioned on the left and right sides of the frame, extending from the foreground to the background and creating strong leading lines that converge toward the center. As the man progresses, the brighter end of the alley, located in the center background, becomes more prominent, revealing a perpendicular street where a bus moves from left to right and other pedestrians walk. The camera, positioned at the man's level, moves forward at the same pace, maintaining a constant distance and keeping him centered in the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man walking forward in an alley, with the camera tracking from behind. The man is centered in the frame, showing his upper body and occupying about half of the frame’s height. He is wearing a dark jacket with his hands in the pockets, and the collar of his jacket is flipped up. He has short hair. The alley is narrow, with tall buildings on either side, and the man is moving towards the brighter end of the alley. The focus remains on the man as he walks, with the surroundings providing context to his movement.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a third-person over-the-shoulder POV shot showing a character from shoulder height, set in a narrow urban alleyway. The environment is outdoors, with tall buildings on either side, creating a confined space. The alley is lined with textured brick walls, one side featuring signs of wear, while the other has a more uniform, tiled appearance. The ground is concrete, with scattered debris and puddles suggesting recent rain. Overhead, fire escapes add to the urban atmosphere. The time of day appears to be overcast, with diffused light casting soft shadows. The scene transitions smoothly as the character walks through the alley, moving towards a brighter street visible at the end, where more modern buildings and a stop sign can be seen. A bus passes by on the perpendicular street at the end of the alley.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This video shows a man walking forward in an alley, with the camera tracking from behind. The man is centered in the frame, showing his upper body, but only occupying about half of the frame’s height, leaving more room for the surroundings.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
