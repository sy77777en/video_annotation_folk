    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of a wine cabinet in the background, filled with various bottles arranged on illuminated shelves. The camera employs a rack focus, transitioning the viewer's attention to the foreground. Here, a medium shot reveals half of a wine glass containing light blue wine positioned on the left side of the frame, while several pieces of white-grey cheese are centrally placed on a sleek countertop. The spatial composition shifts from emphasizing the depth and arrangement of the wine cabinet to highlighting the elegant presentation of the wine glass and cheese in the foreground. The scene is framed at eye level, maintaining a sophisticated and contemporary indoor setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video initially focuses on a wine cabinet in the background, filled with various bottles arranged on shelves. As the focus shifts to the foreground, it reveals half of a wine glass containing light blue wine on the left side. Next to the glass, there are several pieces of white-grey colored cheese placed in the middle. The scene transitions from the detailed view of the wine cabinet to highlighting the wine glass and cheese, emphasizing the change in focus from background to foreground.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting with a focus on a modern, stylish wine cellar. The environment features a tall, illuminated wine rack filled with bottles, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. In the foreground, a sleek countertop holds a glass container with a light blue liquid and a small plate with white snacks, adding a touch of elegance to the scene. The lighting is soft and ambient, suggesting a calm and sophisticated ambiance, likely during the evening. The overall composition highlights the refined and contemporary design of the space.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with the wine cabinet in focus in the background. A rack focus then shifts the attention to the foreground, revealing half of a wine glass with light blue wine on the left and a white-grey colored food item, possibly cheese, in the middle.",
