    "pre_caption": "A close-up, low-angle shot centers on an ostrich's head and neck in the foreground, set against a background of blurred green foliage and a bright sky. The ostrich initially looks directly down at the camera before turning its head to its right, shifting its gaze to the side. A white text box with the word \"OSTRICH\" appears in the bottom-left corner of the foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A close-up shot features the head and long neck of an ostrich. The bird has large, dark, round eyes with long, prominent eyelashes. Its beak is flat and dark-colored. The ostrich's head and neck are covered in short, fuzzy, light brown feathers. Initially, it looks directly at the camera from a low angle, and then it turns its head to its right. A white text box with the word \"OSTRICH\" in capital letters appears in the lower-left portion of the view.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A close-up, low-angle shot captures an ostrich's head and long neck against a soft-focus outdoor background. The environment features blurred green foliage under a bright, pale sky. The ostrich, with large dark eyes and fine feathers on its head, looks around its surroundings. A white text overlay with the word \"OSTRICH\" in capital letters is present in the lower-left corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
