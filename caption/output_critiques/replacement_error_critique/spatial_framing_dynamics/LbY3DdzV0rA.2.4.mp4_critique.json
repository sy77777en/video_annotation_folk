    "pre_caption": "This scenery video is captured in an extreme wide, static shot. A dark, empty field occupies the foreground across the bottom third of the frame. The middle ground consists of a flat plain stretching to a distant horizon line. The background is dominated by a vast sky filled with storm clouds, which take up the upper two-thirds of the frame. A prominent, lower-hanging shelf cloud extends horizontally across the middle of the sky, with a curtain of precipitation falling beneath it, primarily on the left and in the center. In the far background on the right, a mountain range is visible on the horizon. The camera is positioned at a low angle, level with the plain, looking across the landscape as the cloud formations slowly shift across the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases a dramatic landscape scene, capturing a powerful weather event unfolding over a vast, open plain. The sky is dominated by immense, churning clouds tinted in ominous shades of orange, brown, and muted yellow, with a prominent, lower shelf cloud suggesting the leading edge of a severe storm. At the bottom of the video lies an open field, with the horizon marked by the silhouette of a road and scattered utility poles, where a few vehicles pass by. Distant mountains are visible on the right side, adding depth to the scene. The composition's intent is to immerse the viewer in the powerful and awe-inspiring atmosphere of the natural environment, emphasizing the sheer scale of the atmospheric display.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A wide, fixed but slightly shaking shot captures a dramatic storm system at sunset over a vast, flat plain. The sky is filled with immense, turbulent clouds tinged with shades of orange, yellow, and dark brown. A distinct, lower-hanging shelf cloud stretches horizontally across the landscape, with a curtain of rain or dust falling beneath it in the distance. The foreground consists of a dark, empty field, while the silhouette of a distant mountain range is visible on the right horizon.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
