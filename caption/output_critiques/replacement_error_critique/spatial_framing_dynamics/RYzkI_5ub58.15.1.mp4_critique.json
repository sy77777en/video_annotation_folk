    "pre_caption": "The video features a close-up shot of a vibrant underwater scene with various marine life and coral formations. In the foreground, several fish, including those with black and white stripes and darker hues, swim among the corals. These fish are primarily positioned in the bottom left and center of the frame, moving gracefully through the scene. The corals, displaying a range of colors and textures, occupy the middle ground and background, with branching structures in the top left and bulbous formations in the top right. The camera is positioned at the height of the corals, capturing the dynamic movement of the fish as they navigate through the reef. The clear water and sunlight enhance the vivid colors and details of the scene, creating a lively and dynamic underwater environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases a vibrant underwater scene featuring a variety of marine life. Several types of fish, including those with distinct black and white stripes and others with darker hues, swim around a colorful coral reef. The corals display a range of textures and colors, from branching structures in shades of reddish-brown and white to bulbous formations in brown. The fish move gracefully among the corals, creating a dynamic and lively underwater environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an underwater scene in a vibrant coral reef environment. The setting is outdoors beneath the ocean's surface, showcasing a diverse array of coral formations and marine life. The corals display a variety of colors, including russet, white, and shades of brown, with intricate textures and branching shapes. Fish of different species swim around the corals, adding movement and life to the scene. The water is clear, allowing sunlight to illuminate the vivid colors and details of the reef. The overall atmosphere is serene and colorful, highlighting the natural beauty of the underwater ecosystem.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
