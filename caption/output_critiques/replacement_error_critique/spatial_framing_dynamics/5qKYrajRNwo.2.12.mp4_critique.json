    "pre_caption": "The video shows a close-up shot of a pair of small hands holding a framed photograph. Initially, the hands are centered in the frame, holding the photograph in the foreground. The photograph itself is positioned centrally within the frame, depicting a group of five individuals. The hands and photograph occupy the middle ground, while the open trunk and its contents form the background. Various items, such as folded clothes and personal belongings, are arranged around the edges of the trunk, with a green cloth on the right side and a red pouch near the center. As the video progresses, the hands move the photograph downward and place it into the trunk, shifting the photograph from the foreground to the middle ground. The trunk's interior, lined with checkered fabric, remains consistently in the background throughout the sequence. The camera is positioned above the subject, providing a top-down view of the action. There are no significant changes in shot size or camera height during the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a pair of small hands holding a framed photograph and then putting it into a container. The photograph within the frame depicts two individuals in dark tops holding a red object, with three additional people behind them in a group photo. The photograph is set against a vibrant background. Surrounding the hands and photograph are various items, including multiple cloth pieces, suggesting the setting is a storage space or drawer.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, set indoors. The scene features an open trunk filled with various items, including neatly folded clothes and a few personal belongings. A framed photograph is prominently held in the foreground, showcasing a group of people. The trunk's interior is lined with a checkered fabric, and the items inside include a green cloth, a red pouch, and a closed book. The lighting is soft, suggesting an indoor setting with ambient light, and the overall color palette is warm and muted, with earthy tones dominating the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
