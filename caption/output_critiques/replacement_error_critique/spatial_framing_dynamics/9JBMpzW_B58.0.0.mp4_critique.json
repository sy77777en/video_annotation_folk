    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide scenery shot is captured from a high, static vantage point on the bow of a ship. The foreground and middle ground are occupied by the ship's deck and the tops of shipping containers, which fill the bottom third of the frame. In the middle ground, the dark ocean stretches towards the horizon, which is positioned centrally. The background is dominated by a vast, star-filled sky that occupies the upper two-thirds of the frame, with a green and red aurora glowing along the horizon. Throughout the timelapse, dark clouds drift from left to right across the middle of the sky, partially obscuring the aurora and stars. A text overlay is consistently present in the bottom right corner.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a breathtaking night-time seascape scenery shot, captured from the bow of a large cargo ship. The primary focus is on the immense and dynamic environment rather than a specific subject, emphasizing the vastness of nature. The camera looks out over a dark, calm ocean towards a horizon where a faint, ethereal green and reddish glow of an aurora dances beneath a sky blanketed with an incredible density of brilliant stars. Dark, low-lying clouds drift across the frame, partially obscuring the celestial display and adding a sense of movement and depth to the atmospheric scene. Both the foreground and middle ground are occupied by the deck and the tops of shipping containers, which serve as a stable vantage point, grounding the viewer within this spectacular natural light show.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a vantage point on the bow of a large ship at sea, a timelapse captures a night sky filled with countless bright stars. A green and faint red aurora glows on the horizon, partially obscured by dark clouds that move swiftly across the scene. In the foreground and middle ground, the tops of stacked shipping containers in shades of blue, red, and white are visible on the deck of the vessel, which sits on the dark, calm ocean. An overlay at the bottom right of the screen displays the text \"JEFFREY.HK\" next to an Instagram icon and \"JEFFHK\" next to a YouTube icon.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
