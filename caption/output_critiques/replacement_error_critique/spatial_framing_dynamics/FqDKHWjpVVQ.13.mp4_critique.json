    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective at eye-level, a weapon is consistently held in the foreground, positioned at the bottom center and extending towards the middle of the frame. Initially, a large, light-colored concrete wall occupies the middle ground, stretching from the center to the right side of the frame; this wall features a small dark window and a green rectangular icon towards its center-left, and a red diamond icon marked \"76\" towards its center-right. An opening to the left of this wall, also in the middle ground, reveals a brighter outdoor area with green foliage and rocky terrain in the background. A mini-map is overlaid in the bottom left foreground, and a blue rectangular display with numerical data is in the bottom right foreground. Another red diamond icon is visible on a distant structure in the far right background. The view pans slightly to the right, causing the concrete wall to shift more centrally and the left opening to move further towards the left edge of the frame. Subsequently, the view pans slightly back to the left, largely returning the elements to their initial positions within the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a first-person perspective from a video game, showcasing a virtual environment with a focus on a concrete building and a metal staircase. The player's view includes a weapon with a digital display indicating ammunition count. On-screen graphics display a map and various game-related icons, suggesting objectives or player positions. The setting includes multiple trees and a tank in the background, indicating an outdoor, possibly military-themed scenario. The overall scene is characterized by a mix of natural and man-made elements, with a focus on navigation and interaction within the game environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, depicts an outdoor urban setting during daytime. The scene is characterized by light-colored, blocky buildings; one such building has a small, dark, square window, and a nearby wall section is rough-textured and a combination of white and light brown. A dark-colored firearm is held in the foreground. In the distance, visible through a gap between structures, a brighter area contains green foliage and rocky terrain. The perspective shifts slightly. Overlay elements include a mini-map with icons and text names in the bottom-left corner, a blue rectangular display with numerical data in the bottom-right corner, and red diamond-shaped icons with letters, superimposed on the walls and in the distant view.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
