    "pre_caption": "The video presents a static medium shot of a person positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. In the background, a large wooden sign is located in the upper center, mounted on a stone wall that fills the rest of the background. A text caption is overlaid in the foreground at the bottom center of the screen. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young person with light skin and a light-colored ponytail stands while holding a light blue umbrella over their head. They are wearing black-framed glasses, a purple long-sleeved shirt under an orange safety vest, and dark-colored pants. The person is looking down at a book, which they are holding with both hands.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene is set at the entrance to Odin Finch National Park, indicated by a large, dark wooden sign with white lettering mounted on a wall of large, grey, rounded stones. To the left of the main sign is a smaller emblem for the Department of the Interior. A person wearing glasses stands in front of the main sign under a light blue umbrella, looking down at a book. The entire scene is presented with a vintage, sepia-toned filter and framed with rounded corners, resembling an old film projection. Yellow text at the bottom of the screen reads, \"I will never forget this weekend, Dad.\" Additional overlay elements include numerical scales along the right and bottom edges of the frame.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
