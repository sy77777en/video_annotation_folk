    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a dark gray sedan positioned in the center middle ground, driving away from the camera. In the middle ground to the left, an explosion creates a large plume of smoke and fire, while a building is visible in the background on the right. As the car moves away, receding into the background and shifting slightly toward the center-left of the frame, the shot transitions into a wide shot, revealing more of the street. The camera is positioned at the car's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A dark gray, four-door sedan, resembling a Ford Crown Victoria, is shown from a rear three-quarter perspective. The car appears to be an unmarked police vehicle, indicated by two small, flashing lights on the interior rear deck below the back window: a yellow one on the left and a blue one on the right, flashing alternately. The rear license plate is partially visible. The car drives slightly away from the camera on a paved road, near an explosion that contributes to the flames, dust and smoke around it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A dark gray sedan drives down a paved city street. To the left, a building is obscured by thick plumes of gray smoke and bright orange fire. The building on the right, and the distant building on the left, are both possibly made of stone, illuminated by warm, golden light, suggesting either sunrise or sunset. The car is in motion, passing by the fiery scene, with some black explosion debris on the ground to the right of the car.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
