    "pre_caption": "The video is a medium close-up shot focusing on a woman and a man. Initially, the woman is in the left foreground with her back to the camera, and the man is in the right foreground, his face angled towards her and partly visible to the camera. Glittery star decorations are suspended in the top background, accompanied by colorful, out-of-focus lights and indistinct vertical lines in the background. The couple engages in a continuous spin, which dynamically shifts their positions within the frame; for example, the man's back briefly occupies the center-right foreground while the woman's face turns towards the left foreground. As their rotation progresses, the woman is positioned on the left, looking up at the man who is on the right, his profile visible. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with long, straight, light-colored hair is dancing closely with a man. The man has curly, light-colored, shoulder-length hair and is wearing a dark blue suit jacket with a white corsage on the lapel and a dark bowtie. They are seen embracing and spinning together.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors, likely at a dimly lit party or dance, with colorful, out-of-focus lights in red, green, and blue creating a festive atmosphere. Glittery, star-shaped decorations hang from above, catching the light. The background features indistinct vertical lines, possibly from striped wallpaper or curtains, and the overall lighting is soft and somewhat hazy.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
