    "pre_caption": "In a medium close-up shot, a man is initially positioned in the right middle ground of the frame. To his left, a grey wall with two small metallic plates occupies the left foreground. In the background, a door with a rectangular air vent is visible to the right of the center. As the man moves slightly from the right toward the center, the camera pans left, keeping him framed in the right half of the shot. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young, light-skinned man with short, neat brown hair and a clean-shaven face is shown from the chest up. He is wearing a dark, scoop-neck t-shirt. In the dimly lit setting, with one side of his face illuminated and the other in shadow, he looks directly forward with a startled expression, his eyes wide and his mouth slightly open.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a dimly lit room with dark, plain walls and a similarly dark corner. A cool, directional light source casts deep shadows throughout the space. On the left, a large, white cabinet features two small, rectangular metallic plates. A rectangular air vent with horizontal slats is set into the wall in the background. The environment has a cool-toned color scheme. A person is present in the room, and after they pass the corner, the wall with the air vent goes out of the frame.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
