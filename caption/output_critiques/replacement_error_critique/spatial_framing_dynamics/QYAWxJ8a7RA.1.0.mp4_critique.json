    "pre_caption": "The video presents a close-up of a miniature mine scene. A rocky mound occupies the left side of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground. The wooden mine entrance is positioned in the center-left of the frame, in the middle ground, built into this mound. Metal tracks emerge from the mine entrance, running diagonally towards the bottom right foreground, where a small minecart filled with dark material is situated. A wooden crate is visible in the center-left, in the middle ground, beside the tracks near the mine entrance. The ground, a textured brownish-purple, covers the foreground and middle ground across the bottom half of the frame. A textured, brownish backdrop fills the background, visible across the top and right side of the frame. The camera is positioned slightly above the miniature scene, looking down at a gentle angle.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a close-up of a detailed miniature scene depicting a mine entrance. The scene includes a rocky mound with a textured surface, giving the appearance of rugged terrain. A wooden entrance structure is built into the mound, featuring weathered planks and a small overhang. In front of the entrance, a small minecart sits on metal tracks, positioned as if ready to enter or exit the mine. The minecart is simple in design, with a boxy shape and a metallic finish. The overall composition captures the essence of a mining environment on a miniature scale, with attention to detail in the textures and materials used.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene depicts a miniature model of a mine entrance set against a textured, brownish backdrop. A weathered wooden structure with a sloped roof forms the mine opening, nestled into a grey, rocky mound. A small, light-colored mine cart, filled with dark material resembling coal, rests on a set of parallel metal tracks leading out from the dark mine entrance. A wooden crate sits beside the tracks near the entrance. The ground is a textured brownish-purple, simulating dirt or gravel.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up of a detailed miniature scene of a mine entrance, with a rocky mound, a wooden entrance, and a small minecart on metal tracks.",
