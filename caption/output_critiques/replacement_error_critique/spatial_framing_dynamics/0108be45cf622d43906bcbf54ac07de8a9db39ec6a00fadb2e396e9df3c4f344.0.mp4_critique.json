    "pre_caption": "This over-the-shoulder shot positions a woman's out-of-focus head and shoulder in the foreground on the left side of the frame. The main subject, a man, is in focus in the middle ground, centered within the frame and captured in a medium shot. He is positioned inside a black power rack, which is also in the middle ground. In the background, a colorful mural spans the wall behind him, with a wooden pegboard mounted to his right. The man initiates movement by lifting a barbell vertically from his waist to his shoulders, then lowers it and repeats the motion, all while remaining in the center of the frame. The woman in the foreground and the camera, which is at the subjects' level, remain stationary throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows two people in a gym setting. In the foreground, out of focus and seen from behind, is a woman with dark hair tied back in a ponytail, wearing a dark tank top. The primary focus is on a man in the middle ground, framed in a medium shot. He has curly dark hair, is wearing a grey t-shirt and patterned blue and grey shorts. He is actively lifting a barbell with weights, bringing it from a lower position up to his shoulders.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From an over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind a character, showing their upper body and the scene ahead, the setting is an indoor gym. A man performs a weightlifting exercise with a barbell in front of a vibrant wall mural composed of red, yellow, and black abstract patterns. The man is positioned within a black metal power rack. Behind him, a light-colored wooden pegboard is mounted on the wall, marked with the words \"EAST WEST\" stenciled vertically in black. The barbell is loaded with black bumper plates that also feature white lettering.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: An over-the-shoulder shot shows a girl's head in the foreground, out of focus, seemingly watching a man in the middle ground, who is in focus and framed in a medium shot, lifting weights.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
