    "pre_caption": "This is a scenery shot that begins as an extreme wide shot and transitions to a wide shot as the camera moves forward. The Horse Guards building is positioned centrally in the background, with a large, sandy parade ground occupying the entire foreground and middle ground. A line of posts extends across the middle ground, with two equestrian statues also in the middle ground, flanking the building's central entrance. The London Eye is visible in the background to the top left, while the sky fills the top of the frame. A watermark is overlaid in the bottom-right foreground. As the camera, positioned at a straight-on height, advances, the building in the background grows larger within the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a wide cityscape shot of a grand, classical-style building, captured with a forward-moving camera. The symmetrical, light-stone structure features a prominent central clock tower and is viewed from across a vast, empty, sandy courtyard under a partly cloudy sky. The composition lacks a specific main subject, as the focus is on capturing the impressive scale and historical atmosphere of the architectural environment itself. The wide perspective emphasizes the building's grandeur and its place within the larger setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a dynamic scene of the Horse Guards building and its parade ground in London during the day, with the camera moving forward. The large, symmetrical building is constructed from light-colored stone and features a central clock tower, with the London Eye visible in the distance to the left. The courtyard, covered in light brown sand, spans both the foreground and middle ground, bordered by simple posts situated entirely in the middle ground. Two dark equestrian statues stand on either side of the building's central section. The sky is blue with scattered white clouds, and an overlay of a white, stylized watermark is visible in the bottom-right corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with an extreme wide shot of the scenery. It then changes to a wide shot.",
