    "pre_caption": "The video displays a medium shot, focusing on a man located in the center of the frame and the middle ground. Occupying the foreground are two hands: one holding a comb on the bottom left and the other holding scissors on the bottom right. The background features the barbershop setting, encompassing the central subject. The camera maintains a static position at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man with medium brown skin and a voluminous afro hairstyle, wearing a bright red textured sweater. He is the main subject, positioned centrally in a barbershop setting. In the foreground, two hands are visible, one holding a white comb and the other a pair of pink scissors, suggesting a haircut is about to take place. The setting includes a checkered floor and mirrors, enhancing the barbershop atmosphere. The focus is on the interaction between the man and the person holding the grooming tools.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, set in a vibrant barbershop. The environment is indoors, featuring a checkered black-and-white floor and walls adorned with mirrors and shelves. Neon lights in warm tones add a colorful glow to the scene. The setting is lively, with a focus on a person in a bright red sweater standing in front of the viewer. The person’s expression changes, indicating interaction. The viewer's hands are visible, holding a comb and scissors, suggesting a haircut in progress. The overall atmosphere is dynamic and engaging, with a clear focus on the barbershop's bustling activity.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
