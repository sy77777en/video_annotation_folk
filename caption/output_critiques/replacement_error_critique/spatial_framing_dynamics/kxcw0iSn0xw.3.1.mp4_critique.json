    "pre_caption": "The video is captured in a medium close-up shot from a level angle, focusing on a pair of hands and a balloon submerged within a water tank that fills the frame. The hands and lower arms enter from the top of the frame, with the left hand positioned on the left and the right hand on the right, both in the foreground. They hold a twisted, light-blue balloon that occupies the center of the frame in the middle ground, set against a plain white background. The left hand moves a pin from the left side to puncture the balloon. Following the puncture, the balloon's skin rapidly shrinks from left to right across the center of the frame. The water that was inside the balloon momentarily holds its shape in the center before dispersing, sending a large splash and bubbles moving upwards and outwards through the middle ground. The hands remain relatively stationary in their positions on the left and right sides of the frame during this event.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a pair of hands and the lower half of the arms, which have visible arm hair, interacting with a twisted long light blue balloon submerged in a water tank. The hands, with light skin tone, are positioned to press the air-filled balloon into the water. The right hand holds a pin, used to puncture the balloon, causing its outer skin to shrink rapidly. Despite the puncture, the air inside initially retains the balloon's shape before dispersing, and the burst creates a large bubble. The hands are engaged in a precise action, demonstrating controlled and deliberate movement.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an underwater scene in a clear tank filled with water, focusing on a pair of hands interacting with a flexible, light blue object that resembles a tube. The water is clear, allowing for a detailed view of the hands and the object. The background is a plain white surface, enhancing the visibility of the elements within the tank. Bubbles are present, indicating movement and interaction with the water. The lighting is bright, highlighting the smooth texture and glossy surface of the blue object. The scene conveys a sense of clarity and focus on the interaction between the hands and the object within the water.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a pair of hands pressing a twisted long balloon into a water tank. The left hand uses a pin to puncture the balloon, causing the outer skin of the balloon to shrink rapidly. The water inside the balloon still maintains the original shape of the balloon, and then disperses.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
