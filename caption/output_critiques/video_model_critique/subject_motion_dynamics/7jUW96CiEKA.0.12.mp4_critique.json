    "pre_caption": "A group of buffaloes is standing in a grassy field with trees in the background. One buffalo on the right side of the group begins to move forward, gradually joining the rest of the group. The moving buffalo continues to walk forward, aligning itself with the other buffaloes. The group remains mostly stationary, with the moving buffalo now fully integrated into the group.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the salient motions and dynamics of the primary subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary movements, or describe all subjects' collective motion if that is more appropriate.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good because it fails to accurately describe the content of the video and violates the core instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is factually incorrect. It describes a buffalo on the right moving forward to join and align with the group. In the video, the entire herd of buffaloes is already grouped together and remains almost completely stationary throughout the clip. There is no discernible forward movement from any individual buffalo to \"join\" the group. They are simply standing still in the tall grass, looking towards the camera.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is incomplete because it fabricates a narrative of movement instead of describing the actual scene. The most significant aspect of the \"motion\" in this video is its absence. The caption fails to convey that the subjects are static.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption directly contradicts the instruction: \"If the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\" Instead of noting the lack of movement, the caption invents a sequence of actions that do not occur.",
