The column is dramatically illuminated with a cool, greenish-blue light, standing in contrast to the warm, golden glow from the windows of the elegant surrounding buildings. Ornate street lamps cast bright, starburst-like light across the square.\n\nThe camera performs a slow, upward tilting motion, gradually emphasizing the height and grandeur of the monument against the dark night sky.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption should be revised to focus solely on motion as per the instructions. The entire first paragraph is a static description of the scene (the location, lighting, and buildings) and contains subjective adjectives (\"stunning,\" \"iconic,\" \"dramatically,\" \"elegant\"), all of which should be removed. The second paragraph correctly identifies the camera motion but includes the interpretive phrase \"emphasizing the height and grandeur,\" which should be replaced with a more objective description. The final output should be a single, concise paragraph describing only the camera's movement.",
