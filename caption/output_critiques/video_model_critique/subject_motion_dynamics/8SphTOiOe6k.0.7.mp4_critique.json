  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly describes the video as a static scenery shot and completely omits the description of motion, which is a key requirement of the instructions. The video is not static; the camera pans to the right to reveal more of the street. Additionally, there are salient subjects—multiple people—walking along the street and sidewalk, but their movements are not described. The caption should be revised to describe the camera's panning motion first, followed by a description of the pedestrians walking through the scene. The current focus on static architectural and background details should be reduced to prioritize the description of movement.",
