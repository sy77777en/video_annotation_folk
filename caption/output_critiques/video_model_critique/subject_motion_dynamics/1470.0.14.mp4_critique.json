    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a person with a distinctive appearance. The individual has medium-length, straight red hair and is wearing a white dress shirt paired with a blue and white striped tie. Their face is marked with unusual, exaggerated features, including a prominent, wide smile and large eyes, giving an artificial or mask-like impression. The person is standing upright, and the setting appears to be indoors. In the latter part of the video, the person is shown wearing dark pants, with their hands relaxed by their sides. The overall appearance is striking due to the combination of formal clothing and the unique facial characteristics.**",

  "generated_critique": "**Feedback on the Caption:**\n\nThe provided caption is inaccurate and incomplete.\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description of the subject's and camera's motion is incorrect. The person does not turn their head to the right, nor does the camera move downward to show their torso and legs. The subject remains facing forward in a medium close-up shot throughout the video.\n*   **Completeness:** The caption completely omits the most significant action in the video. There is a quick cut where the person's eyes abruptly turn completely white, which is a crucial visual event that should be described.\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption fails to adhere to the core instruction of providing an accurate description of the subject's motion. By inventing movements that do not occur and missing the key visual change, it does not faithfully represent the content of the video.",
