The only visible motion in the video is the steady flow of water down the waterfall and stream, and two people in the distance who stand still for most of the video, with one briefly raising a camera to take a photo. The caption should be revised to concisely describe the water flowing over the rocks and the minimal movement of the people, omitting unnecessary details about the gardenâ€™s appearance and atmosphere.",
