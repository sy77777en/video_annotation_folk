    "pre_caption": "A wooden cutting board is shown with a pile of chopped cucumbers, a large knife with a white handle, and some green onions, tomatoes, and lettuce placed in front of the board. A person moves from the left side of the frame to the right, partially visible in the background. The person continues to move out of the frame, leaving the chopped cucumbers and the vegetables on the cutting board.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the salient motions and dynamics of the primary subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary movements, or describe all subjects' collective motion if that is more appropriate.",

  "generated_critique": "The provided caption is good. Here is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the instructions:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the static objects in the scene (a wooden cutting board, chopped cucumbers, a knife, green onions, tomatoes, and lettuce) and accurately describes the motion of the partially visible person moving from left to right in the background and exiting the frame.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is complete. It describes both the static elements that make up the main subject of the shot and the only movement that occurs in the video, providing a full picture of the content.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Chronological Order:** The caption correctly presents the person's movement in chronological order: first moving from left to right, then continuing out of the frame.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** It successfully focuses on the motion of the person after setting the initial scene.\n*   **Objectivity:** The description is objective and factual, avoiding any emotional, subjective, or speculative language (e.g., \"the person seems to be in a hurry\").\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple and clear. While it could be slightly more concise by combining the two sentences describing the person's movement, it is not overly wordy and effectively communicates the action. The final phrase \"leaving the chopped cucumbers...\" is slightly redundant but does not detract significantly from the overall quality.\n*   **Format:** It adheres to the single-paragraph format.\n\nIn summary, the caption is effective, accurate, and follows the provided instructions well. It clearly describes the scene and the limited motion within it.",
