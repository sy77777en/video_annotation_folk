    "pre_caption": "In a room with wooden walls, a brick fireplace, and a sofa with a patterned blanket, a man in a yellow sweater and dark pants is seen holding a woman with a towel wrapped around her head and a white robe. The woman in the checkered dress is pulling the child in the red hat away from the scene. The man continues to hold the woman as the woman in the checkered dress and the child move further away. The woman in the checkered dress and the child are now further from the scene, while the man and the woman with the towel are still in the same position. The woman in the checkered dress and the child are now out of the frame, and the man and the woman with the towel are still holding each other.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a group of people in a room with wood-paneled walls and a brick fireplace. There are four people including a man in a yellow sweater and dark pants. A woman with short blonde hair, wearing a blue and white checkered dress. A child in a suit with many patterns and  wearing a red hat. Another woman with a towel wrapped around her head and a white robe is visible. All four individuals are moving in a panicked manner. The setting includes a sofa with a patterned blanket and a floor lamp with an orange shade.**",

They seem to be dancing or struggling. The man is lifting her and spinning her around.\n    *   A woman in a blue and white checkered dress is pulling another person, a child in a red hat, away from the man and woman.\n    *   The woman in the checkered dress and the child move towards the left side of the frame and eventually out of view.\n    *   The man and the woman in the robe continue their interaction, which looks like a chaotic dance or a struggle. The man spins her.\n    *   The camera is a bit shaky, following the action.\n\n2.  **Analyze the provided caption:**\n    *   \"In a room with wooden walls, a brick fireplace, and a sofa with a patterned blanket, a man in a yellow sweater and dark pants is seen holding a woman with a towel wrapped around her head and a white robe.\" - This sets the scene and identifies the subjects. It's accurate but doesn't describe motion yet.\n    *   \"The woman in the checkered dress is pulling the child in the red hat away from the scene.\" - This is accurate. It describes the motion of two other subjects.\n    *   \"The man continues to hold the woman as the woman in the checkered dress and the child move further away.\" - This is also accurate. It describes the ongoing state of the first pair and the continued motion of the second pair.\n    *   \"The woman in the checkered dress and the child are now further from the scene, while the man and the woman with the towel are still in the same position.\" - \"Still in the same position\" is inaccurate. The man is actively moving, spinning the woman he's holding. They are not static.\n    *   \"The woman in the checkered dress and the child are now out of the frame, and the man and the woman with the towel are still holding each other.\" - \"Still holding each other\" is true, but it misses the key motion. The man is spinning her. The caption makes them sound static, which is a major flaw.\n\n3.  **Evaluate against the instructions:**\n    *   **Concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion:** The caption is more of a play-by-play of who is where, rather than a description of the *motion*. It fails to capture the dynamic movement of the central pair (the man spinning the woman).\n    *   **Chronological order:** The order of events is correct.\n    *   **Focus on motion rather than repeating details:** It repeats the state of \"holding\" multiple times but misses the actual *movement*.\n    *   **Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain:** The caption does this well.\n    *   **Simple, natural English:** The language is simple.\n    *   **Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives:** The caption does this well.\n    *   **Avoid speculative statements:** The caption does this well.\n    *   **Return only one-paragraph video description:** The caption is one paragraph.\n    *   **Describe individual subject actions with clarity, specifying how they move:** This is the main failure. It says the man is \"holding\" the woman, but not that he is spinning her or lifting her. It says they are \"in the same position,\" which is false. It correctly describes the woman in the checkered dress \"pulling\" the child.\n    *   **Interactions between subjects:** It describes the interaction of \"pulling\" and \"holding,\" but misses the more dynamic interaction of spinning.\n    *   **Multiple subjects:** It attempts to describe all subjects, but the description of the main pair's motion is severely lacking.\n\n4.  **Formulate the feedback:**\n    *   **Accuracy:** The caption is inaccurate in its description of the central pair's motion. It describes them as static (\"in the same position,\" \"still holding each other\") when they are clearly in motion (the man is spinning the woman).\n    *   **Completeness:** The caption is incomplete because it omits the most significant motion in the video: the man spinning the woman he is holding. It correctly identifies the woman pulling the child away.\n    *   **Adherence to instructions:**\n        *   It fails to \"Describe individual subject actions with clarity, specifying how they move\" for the main subjects. Instead of describing the spinning motion, it uses the static verb \"holding.\"\n        *   It fails to \"focus on the subject's motion\" for the central pair, instead repeatedly stating their static relationship (\"holding\").\n        *   It correctly follows the other instructions (chronological order, no speculation, one paragraph, etc.).\n\n5.  **Final check:** The feedback should be detailed, pointing out specific phrases in the caption that are problematic and explaining *why* they violate the instructions.

It repeatedly describes the man and the woman in the robe as static, using phrases like \"still in the same position\" and \"still holding each other.\" In the video, the man is actively and continuously spinning the woman around. This is a significant misrepresentation of their motion.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is incomplete. It fails to mention the most prominent action in the scene: the man spinning the woman. While it correctly notes that a woman in a checkered dress pulls a child away, it omits the dynamic interaction of the central pair, which is the main focus of the video.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption fails to adhere to several key instructions:\n*   It does not \"Describe individual subject actions with clarity, specifying how they move.\" Instead of describing the man spinning the woman, it uses the generic and static verb \"holding.\"\n*   It does not \"Focus on the subject's motion.\" For the main subjects, it focuses on their static state of contact rather than their dynamic movement.\n*   The inclusion of excessive scene-setting details (\"In a room with wooden walls, a brick fireplace, and a sofa with a patterned blanket\") detracts from the primary goal of describing motion.",
