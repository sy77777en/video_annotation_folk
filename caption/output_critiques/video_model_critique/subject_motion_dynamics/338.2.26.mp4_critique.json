    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video depicts a bustling restaurant scene. Initially, a man with short dark hair, wearing a light-colored short-sleeve shirt, is seen eating noodles. He is positioned in the foreground, holding chopsticks and a portable electric fan. In the background, other diners are visible, including a server in a maroon shirt standing and a woman with long hair seated at a table. The camera then pans to reveal a robotic vacuum cleaner on the patterned carpeted floor, moving amidst the dining area. Several tables are occupied by diners engaged in conversation, including a woman in a colorful sleeveless top and a man in a hat. The setting is lively, with a mix of seated patrons and waitstaff moving around.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains several significant factual errors. The man holding the blue object is not eating noodles; the man to his right is. The object is not a portable electric fan but a blue retractable dog leash, which he is waving around his face. Furthermore, the camera does not pan to the left, and there is no robotic vacuum cleaner on the floor. The description should be corrected to accurately reflect the subject's actions. A more accurate caption would describe the man in the foreground waving the end of a dog leash around his head, while the man next to him eats with chopsticks and another man walks in the background.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a bustling restaurant with ornate wall carvings, a man in a light-colored shirt sits at a table and waves the end of a blue retractable dog leash near his face. To his right, a man in a yellow shirt and glasses eats with chopsticks. In the background, another man in a maroon shirt walks past their table.",
