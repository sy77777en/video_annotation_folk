    "pre_caption": "In a dark, pixelated environment, two glowing cranes stand in shallow water, with one crane slightly ahead of the other. The cranes begin to move to the right, with the rightmost crane turning to face left. A blue-grey blob with eyes appears at the top right, moving left and jumping over obstacles. The blob successfully climbs a wall and jumps through a gap in the ceiling.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the main subjects in this video exhibit **atypical motion, posture, or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video showcases two stylized, pixelated cranes with glowing white and blue hues, standing in shallow water within an underground or cave-like setting. Their bodies are illuminated, creating a striking contrast against the dark surroundings. The cranes are positioned side by side, with one slightly ahead of the other, both initially facing to the right. As the video progresses, the rightmost crane turns to face left. Their long necks are gracefully curved, and they stand on thin legs. A blue-grey blob with eyes appears at the top right of the screen, moving left and jumping several times to overcome obstacles. Eventually, the blob jumps to climb a wall towards a gap in the ceiling. The scene has a digital, retro aesthetic, emphasizing the vibrant colors and pixelated design of the cranes.**",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback on the caption is as follows:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is partially inaccurate. The main character, described as a \"blue-grey blob,\" does not \"appear at the top right\"; it is already on a platform near the center at the start of the video. The description of its movement is also not entirely correct; it first moves left, then turns and moves right to jump over a gap. The action of \"climbs a wall\" is also an inaccurate description of the character jumping up to a higher platform. The description of the birds' movement is accurate.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption mentions the key subjects and their general movements. However, it lacks precision in describing the platforming sequence of the main character, omitting the initial leftward movement and the turn before the jump.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Chronological Order:** The caption fails to present the main character's actions in the correct chronological order.\n*   **Clarity of Action:** The phrase \"climbs a wall\" is an imprecise and inaccurate description of the character's jumping motion.\n*   **Avoid Non-Visible/Uncertain Information:** Stating that the blob \"appears\" is incorrect, as it is visible from the beginning of the clip.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The caption appropriately focuses on motion but leads with a static scene description, which could be integrated more smoothly with the action.\n\nIn summary, the caption fails to accurately describe the main character's starting position and the chronological sequence of its movements. The language used to describe its actions could also be more precise.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a dark, pixelated environment, a small, round, greyish character with eyes stands on a platform above two large, glowing cranes in the water. The character moves left, then turns and moves right, jumping across a gap. It then jumps up to a higher platform and subsequently jumps left through an opening in the ceiling. As this happens, the two cranes below begin to move to the right, and the rightmost crane turns to face left.",
