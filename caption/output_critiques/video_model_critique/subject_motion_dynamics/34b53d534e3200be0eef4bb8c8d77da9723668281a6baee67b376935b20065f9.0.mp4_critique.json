    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up of a path covered in yellow leaves, with a hedge of green foliage and yellow flowers in the background. As the camera moves forward, a woman sitting on the ground against the hedge becomes visible. She is wearing a dark jacket and black pants with white stripes. Two men are crouched near her, one in a white shirt and the other in a yellow shirt, both appearing to be focused on something on the ground. The background includes a fence and some parked cars, indicating an outdoor setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the subject is revealed through either subject movement or camera movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video reveals a scene along a path covered with yellow leaves. Initially, the focus is on the leaves and a hedge covered with yellow leaves that have fallen onto it. As the scene unfolds, a woman is shown sitting on the ground, leaning against the hedge. She has medium-length dark hair and is wearing a dark jacket and black pants with white stripes. Nearby, two men are facing her. One man is wearing a white shirt and navy jeans, and the other is wearing a yellow shirt. Both men have a fair skin tone. The setting suggests a quiet, outdoor area lined with hedges and a fence, with multiple cars visible in the distance.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good. It contains factual inaccuracies and fails to adhere to several key instructions, particularly regarding the focus on motion and the avoidance of speculation.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption incorrectly states that the camera \"moves forward.\" The camera actually pulls backward and pans slightly to reveal the full scene.\n*   It inaccurately describes the man in the white shirt as being \"focused on something on the ground.\" He is clearly holding a device (likely a phone) and taking a photograph of the woman. This is the central action of the video.\n*   It identifies a person in a \"yellow shirt,\" which is an assumption. The person has a yellow backpack, but their shirt is not clearly visible.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption completely misses the main event of the video: a photoshoot. It fails to describe the interaction between the photographer and the model (the woman).\n*   It omits the specific action of the man in the white shirt crouching down and using a device to take a picture. It also misses that he briefly arranges the yellow petals on the ground.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The caption focuses heavily on static descriptions (the path, the hedge, the woman's clothing, the background) rather than the subjects' movements, which is the primary requirement. The key motions of the camera pulling back and the man photographing the woman are either described incorrectly or omitted.\n*   **Avoid Speculation:** The caption uses the phrase \"appearing to be,\" which is explicitly forbidden by the instructions.\n*   **Describe Specific Actions:** Instead of the specific action \"a man crouches to take a photograph of a woman,\" the caption uses the vague and inaccurate description \"focused on something on the ground.\"\n*   **Describe Interactions Between Subjects:** The caption fails to describe the clear photographer-model interaction, which is a core element of the scene.\n*   **Chronological Order:** While it follows a basic chronological order of revealing subjects, it misses the key actions that occur within that timeline.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens on a low-angle, close-up shot of yellow petals scattered across a paved path beside a flowering hedge. The camera pulls backward and pans right, revealing a woman in a dark top and pants sitting on the ground, leaning against the hedge. As the camera continues to pull back, a man in a white t-shirt crouches in front of her, holding a phone horizontally to take her picture from a low angle. He briefly uses his hand to arrange the petals on the ground. Another person with a yellow backpack is partially visible, crouched next to the photographer. The scene takes place outdoors along a chain-link fence, with parked cars in the background.",
