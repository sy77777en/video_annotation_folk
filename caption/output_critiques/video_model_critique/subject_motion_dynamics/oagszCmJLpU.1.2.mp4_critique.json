  "generated_critique": "The caption fails to describe the subject's motion, which is the central requirement of the instructions. Instead of detailing the cloud's movement in the time-lapse, the caption provides a static description of its appearance (\"brilliantly lit by the sun, contrasting with its dark, shadowy base\") and includes explanatory meteorological terms (\"cumulonimbus cloud, also known as a thunderhead\"). The description should be revised to focus on the visual action, such as how the cloud billows and its top expands horizontally over time.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In this time-lapse, a massive storm cloud undergoes dramatic growth. The main body of the cloud billows and churns with immense energy as its brilliantly lit top spreads out horizontally, forming a vast anvil shape against the deep blue sky. Below, the dark, shadowy base constantly shifts and changes over the flat horizon.",
