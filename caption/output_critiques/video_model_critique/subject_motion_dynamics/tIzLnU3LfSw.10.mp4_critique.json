    "pre_caption": "A group of hockey players in dark blue jerseys celebrates near the boards. One player embraces a teammate wearing number 27, and another player with the number 9 skates in to join the group hug. The players pat each other on the back and raise their arms. A fourth teammate, wearing number 25, skates in from the right to join the celebration. An opposing player in a white and gold uniform skates away from the group, and a referee skates into position nearby.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A group of hockey players in dark blue jerseys with red and white trim, red pants, and dark blue helmets celebrates on the ice. The players, including one with the number 27 and another with the number 9, gather in a group hug near the boards, patting each other on the back. Another teammate, wearing number 25, skates in from the right to join the celebration. An opposing player in a white and gold uniform skates away from the group. A referee in a black and white striped shirt and a black helmet is positioned near the celebrating players. Behind the protective glass, a crowd of spectators, consisting of men and women in casual clothing, watches from tiered seating. One man in the crowd wears a grey sweatshirt with the word \"PENGUINS\" on the front.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly states that the player wearing number 25 is the \"fourth teammate\" to join the celebration. In the video, there are already four players in the huddle when number 25 skates in, making him the fifth. This should be corrected by changing \"A fourth teammate\" to \"Another teammate.\" Additionally, the description of the celebration's start could be more precise. Instead of stating that a group celebrates, the caption should describe the initial action of one player skating to the boards and embracing the teammate wearing number 27, which then leads to the group forming.",
