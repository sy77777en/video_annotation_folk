    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A person's light-skinned hand, emerging from the sleeve of a white shirt, is poised to turn the page of an open instruction manual. The manual's white pages feature numbered, technical diagrams illustrating the step-by-step assembly of a model. The drawings show small, gray, brown, and black mechanical components being connected, with some steps highlighted against a light tan background.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is good. Here is a detailed breakdown of the feedback.\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies that a person's hand is holding the corner of an instruction manual's page and that the primary motion is a slight lift.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption fully describes the single, brief motion that occurs in the video. It captures the subtlety of the action with the word \"slightly.\"\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Motion Description:** The caption successfully describes the subject's motion (\"holds... and slightly lifts it\") in chronological order. It is specific and clear.\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The description is concise, well-written in natural English, and easy to understand.\n*   **Objectivity:** The caption is objective and avoids emotional or subjective language. The phrase \"preparing to turn it\" is a minor inference of intent. While the action shown is indeed the preparation for turning a page, the instruction is to \"Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain.\" A stricter adherence would focus only on the visible lift. However, in this context, the inference is logical, adds clarity to the action's purpose, and doesn't feel overly speculative.\n*   **Formatting:** The caption adheres to the single-paragraph, no-markdown format.\n\nOverall, the caption is excellent. It provides a clear, accurate, and concise description of the video's content while adhering very well to the provided guidelines. The minor inference of intent is a reasonable one that improves the description's readability.",
