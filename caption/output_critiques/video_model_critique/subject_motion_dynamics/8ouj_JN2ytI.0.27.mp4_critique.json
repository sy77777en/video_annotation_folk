The first sentence focuses on describing the static shot type and location rather than the motion, which goes against the instruction to \"Focus on the subject's motion.\" The description of the camera movement and the explosions should be integrated into a single, concise statement that prioritizes the action. A better approach would be to start the description with the camera's movement and then describe the explosions that occur within the moving frame.",
