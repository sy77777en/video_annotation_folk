  "generated_critique": "The caption fails to follow the primary instruction, which is to describe motion. It focuses almost entirely on describing the static scenery (dilapidated corridor, graffiti, debris), which the instructions explicitly state to avoid in favor of describing movement. The instruction for a scenery shot without salient subjects is to briefly note this, but the caption provides a detailed environmental description instead. The caption should be rewritten to focus only on the camera's movement. Additionally, the phrase \"appears to be leading\" is speculative and violates the instruction to avoid such statements. A correct caption would simply describe the camera's steady forward movement through the corridor.",
