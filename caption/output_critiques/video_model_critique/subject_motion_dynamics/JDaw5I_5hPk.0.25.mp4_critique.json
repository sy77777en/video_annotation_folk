However, the instructions state, \"If the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\" The current caption describes the scene but fails to explicitly mention the complete lack of movement. Additionally, it assumes the perspective is \"of someone,\" which is speculative. The caption should be revised to state that the shot is static and remove the speculation. A more appropriate description would be: \"This is a static, point-of-view shot looking forward along a rope and wood suspension bridge in a forest. The bridge connects platforms built around large trees, and there is no movement in the scene.\"",
