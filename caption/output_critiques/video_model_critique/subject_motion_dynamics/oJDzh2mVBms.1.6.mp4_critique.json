  "generated_critique": "The caption focuses on describing the static scene rather than the motion of the subject as instructed. The instruction requires a description of the subject's motion, but the caption only vaguely mentions a \"dynamic display.\" It should be revised to specifically describe how the aurora moves, for example, by stating that the green lights shimmer and shift across the sky. The caption also includes the subjective adjective \"vibrant,\" which is forbidden by the instructions. The sentences describing the static trees and landscape should be removed to maintain focus on the motion.",
