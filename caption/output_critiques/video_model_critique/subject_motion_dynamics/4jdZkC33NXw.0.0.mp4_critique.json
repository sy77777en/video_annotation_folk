The only relevant motion described is \"the camera moves forward and descends down the stairs,\" but this should be stated more directly and concisely, focusing solely on the camera's movement in chronological order. The caption should be revised to: \"The camera moves forward and then descends the stairs, capturing the street below.\" All other descriptive and subjective elements should be removed.",
