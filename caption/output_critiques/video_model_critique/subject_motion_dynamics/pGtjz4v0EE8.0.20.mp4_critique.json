The instruction specifies, \"If the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\" The video is a static shot with no movement. Therefore, the caption should be revised to state this fact directly, rather than describing the architectural details. A more appropriate caption would be: \"This is a static shot of an ornate building facade, with no movement occurring.\"",
