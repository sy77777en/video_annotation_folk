    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video primarily features a young, light-skinned person with long blonde hair running on a grassy field. This individual is wearing a black and pink short-sleeved football jersey, black shorts, long black socks with white accents, and dark athletic shoes. To the runner's left, a light-skinned man with short dark hair and a black headband walks and observes; he is dressed in a pink t-shirt, dark shorts, and white athletic shoes. Standing in a line behind the runner is a group of other young people, also wearing the same black and pink football uniforms. Later in the video, the runner is seen interacting with a large yellow tackle pad held by a man in a dark vest.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately presents the main subject’s motion in chronological order, describing the person running forward on the field and making contact with the tackle pad. However, it incorrectly states that a man in a pink shirt \"walks alongside them,\" when in fact he jogs or runs parallel to the main subject for a short distance rather than walking. The caption also mentions the group of young people in the background standing in a line, which is relevant for context but could be more concise by specifying that they remain stationary. To improve the caption, revise it to: \"A young player sprints forward on a grassy field while a man in a pink shirt jogs alongside for a few steps. The player then collides with a large yellow tackle pad held by another man, as a group of other young players stands in a line in the background.\" This version more accurately reflects the observed actions and maintains clarity and conciseness.",
