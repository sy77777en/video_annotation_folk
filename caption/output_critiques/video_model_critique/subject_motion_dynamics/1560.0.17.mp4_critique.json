    "pre_caption": "A man in a brown jacket and blue jeans is walking through a snowy park, moving from the left side of the frame towards the right. The background features a large building with arched windows and a courtyard, surrounded by snow-covered trees and bushes. The man continues to walk steadily, passing by the hedge and trees. The two people on the bench remain seated, seemingly engaged in conversation or quiet activities.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a young man walking through a snowy park. He has light skin and short hair, and he is wearing a brown jacket, blue jeans, and brown shoes. He carries a black backpack on both shoulders. The man is walking along a path lined with leafless trees and a hedge. Not far away, there are two people dressed in dark clothing seated on a bench. The setting is serene, with snow covering the ground and the branches of the trees.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is good but could be improved to better align with the instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is accurate. It correctly identifies the subject, his clothing, his action (walking from left to right), and the surrounding environment (snowy park, building, trees, people on a bench).\n\n**Completeness:** The description covers the primary motion in the video.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The caption adheres to this for the most part but includes a full sentence dedicated to describing the static background (\"The background features a large building...\"). The instructions state to \"Focus on the subject's motion,\" so this level of detail about the scenery is not ideal.\n*   **Avoid Speculation:** The caption violates the instruction to \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options.\" The phrase \"seemingly engaged in conversation or quiet activities\" is a speculative assumption about the people on the bench. A better description would simply state that they remain seated.\n*   **Conciseness:** By removing the detailed background description and the speculative phrase, the caption could be more concise and focused on the essential action as required.\n\nIn summary, the caption is factually correct but includes speculative language and an unnecessary level of detail about the static background, which goes against the provided guidelines.",
