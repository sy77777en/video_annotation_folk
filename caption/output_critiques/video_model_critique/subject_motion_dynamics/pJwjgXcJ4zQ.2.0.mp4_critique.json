  "generated_critique": "The caption does not follow the instruction closely enough. It is too general and does not describe the specific motion of the subjects in the video. The caption repeats details about the environment (shops, signs, advertisements, city atmosphere) that are not relevant to the subject’s motion and are already implied by the visual context. The caption should instead focus on the actions of the people: for example, “Pedestrians walk along the sidewalk in both directions, with some individuals crossing the street at the intersection. A cyclist rides past the camera, and small groups of people move together while others walk alone.” The revised caption should present these actions in chronological order and avoid unnecessary environmental or atmospheric details.",
