However, it includes excessive descriptive details about the static kitchen scene, such as the color of the cooker, the style of the cabinets, the material of the countertops, and the adjective \"distinctive\" used for the tiles. These details are unnecessary as per the instruction to focus on motion. The description should be simplified to only describe the camera's movement and what is revealed as a result of that motion, such as the range hood appearing in the frame.",
