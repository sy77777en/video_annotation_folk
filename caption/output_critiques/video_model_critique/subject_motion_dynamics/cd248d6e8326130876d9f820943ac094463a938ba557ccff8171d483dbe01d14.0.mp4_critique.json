    "pre_caption": "The video begins with an individual in striped leggings standing in a doorway at the edge of an ice rink. Another individual in a black top skates from the center gate across the ice towards the left. Subsequently, an individual in a grey top skates out from the doorway, moving leftward. This is followed by an individual in all black, who also skates out from the doorway to the left. Finally, the first individual in striped leggings skates out from the doorway, moving leftward onto the ice.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows the lower bodies of four individuals on an ice rink, all wearing white figure skates. The first individual, initially positioned in a doorway, wears black leggings with three thin white vertical stripes on each outer leg and a dark blue and black top. A second individual, wearing black leggings and a black long-sleeved top, enters the ice rink from the center gate and skates toward the left across the scene. A third individual, dressed in black leggings without stripes and a light grey top, skates out from the same doorway. The fourth skater, wearing all black, follows. Finally, the first skater moves after the other three, skating leftward further into the rink.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly identifies the number of subjects and misinterprets a repeated action as new events. The video shows only two skaters, not four. The action of the first skater (in a grey top, not black) jumping onto the ice is shown twice due to a video loop, which the caption mistakenly describes as three different individuals (\"individual in a black top,\" \"individual in a grey top,\" and \"individual in all black\"). The description should be corrected to state that one skater in a grey top jumps onto the ice and skates left, this action repeats, and then a second skater in striped leggings skates onto the ice and moves left.",

Following this, the second skater, who is wearing black leggings with white stripes, skates out from the same doorway and moves to the left.",
