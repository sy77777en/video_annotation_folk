    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up of the roof of a black vehicle, highlighting the advanced technology components, including a taller, slender cylinder and a shorter, dome-shaped structure. A translucent blue circular wave starts to form and rotate around the roof, indicating the activation of a radar or sensor system. The camera gradually zooms out, revealing more of the vehicle's roof and the surrounding road environment, which includes lane markings and crosswalks. The blue circular wave continues to rotate and expand, further emphasizing the vehicle's technological capabilities. The video concludes with a wider view of the vehicle, showing the blue circular wave fully formed and rotating around the roof, with the road and crosswalks in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a sleek, black vehicle with a glossy finish, prominently displaying advanced technology on its roof. The roof is equipped with two distinct cylindrical devices: one is a taller, slender cylinder, and the other is a shorter, dome-shaped structure. These devices are likely sensors or communication equipment. The vehicle is shown on a road, and a translucent blue circular wave emanates from the roof, suggesting the activation of a radar or sensor system. The vehicle's design is modern, with smooth lines and a streamlined shape, emphasizing its technological sophistication.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good for this video.\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption accurately describes the visual elements present in the video, such as the black vehicle's roof, the technology components, the blue circular wave, and the road markings. The chronological order of events (the wave appearing, the camera zooming out) is also correct.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is incomplete because it fails to describe the primary motion of the subject. The vehicle is clearly moving forward, as evidenced by the road passing underneath it. This is a crucial aspect of the subject's motion that has been omitted.\n\n**Adherence to the Given Instruction:**\nThe caption does not adhere to several key instructions:\n*   **Focus on motion:** The caption fails to describe the vehicle's forward movement, which is the main action.\n*   **Avoid abstract descriptions:** The caption includes interpretive and abstract phrases like \"highlighting the advanced technology components\" and \"further emphasizing the vehicle's technological capabilities.\" The instructions explicitly state to avoid such descriptions and focus only on observable motion.\n*   **Avoid speculative statements:** The phrase \"indicating the activation of a radar or sensor system\" is an interpretation of the graphic's purpose, not a direct description of its motion. The instructions require describing only what is visibly happening.\n\nIn summary, the caption focuses too much on describing static objects and interpreting the video's intent, while completely missing the primary motion of the subject (the car driving). It also violates the rule against using abstract descriptions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "An overhead shot follows a black vehicle as it drives along a road. On the roof of the vehicle, a translucent blue circular wave graphic appears around an antenna, rotating and expanding. As the vehicle continues to move forward over road markings and a crosswalk, the camera pulls back and up, revealing more of the vehicle and the surrounding road. The blue wave continues to rotate and expand around the vehicle's roof throughout the shot.",
