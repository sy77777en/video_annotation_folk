The description of the subjects' motion is too general. The focus should be solely on the movement of the boats. The description should be revised to remove the scenic details and provide a more specific account of the boats' actions, such as: \"In a static, wide-angle shot, several motorboats travel across the canal, leaving white wakes in the water.\"",
