    "pre_caption": "The video shows a passenger boat navigating a river. Initially, the boat is seen from above and behind, moving steadily along the river. The camera then arcs around and descends to capture a wide shot from the front, focusing on the boat's bow. A person is seated at the bow, wearing a gray-white short-sleeve shirt and dark-colored pants. The river is bordered by lush greenery and a sandy bank, creating a natural backdrop.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a passenger boat navigating a river. Initially, it is captured in an extreme wide shot from above and behind, highlighting the boat's position on the river. As the camera arcs around and descends, the focus shifts to a wide shot from the front, revealing the boat's bow. Seated at the bow is a person dressed in a gray-white short-sleeve shirt and dark-colored pants. The river is flanked by lush greenery and a sandy bank, providing a natural backdrop to the scene.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good for this video.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:** The description is factually accurate. The video does show a passenger boat, the camera does move from behind to the front, and the scenery is as described.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption covers the main elements of the video.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption fails to adhere to several key instructions:\n*   **Focus on Subject's Motion:** The caption dedicates a significant portion to describing the camera's movement (\"The camera then arcs around and descends to capture a wide shot from the front...\") and the static appearance of a passenger (\"wearing a gray-white short-sleeve shirt and dark-colored pants\"). The instructions explicitly state to \"Focus on the subject's motion\" and \"Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects.\"\n*   **Describing Scenery:** While context is useful, the sentence \"The river is bordered by lush greenery and a sandy bank, creating a natural backdrop\" describes the scenery rather than the subject's action. Since there is a clear moving subject, the focus should remain on its motion.\n\nIn summary, the caption is more of a general shot description than a focused description of the subject's motion as required by the instructions. It includes details about camera work and subject appearance that should have been omitted in favor of a more concise description of the boat's movement.",
