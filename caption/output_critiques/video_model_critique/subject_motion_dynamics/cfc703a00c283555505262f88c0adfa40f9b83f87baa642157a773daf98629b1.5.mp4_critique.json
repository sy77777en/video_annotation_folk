However, it includes a detailed description of the static landscape in the second sentence, which is unnecessary according to the instructions for scenery shots. The instruction states to \"briefly note\" that it is a scenery shot in one to three sentences and to focus on motion. The second sentence, \"The river is flanked by stony banks, with a line of green trees on one side and a larger, tree-covered hill in the distance under a blue sky with white clouds,\" should be removed to make the caption more concise and focused on the dynamic aspect of the video, which is the camera's movement.",
