    "pre_caption": "A black line-drawn hand with five fingers grasps a white circular ball, which remains solid white. The hand moves out of the frame, and the ball is thrown, reverting to a black outline. Upon hitting a gridded surface, the ball briefly deforms into an oval before bouncing back up and returning to its circular shape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video displays a black line-drawn human hand, featuring five fingers and a portion of an arm, interacting with a circular object. The hand grasps the object, which is then thrown. It bounces three times in the same position and briefly deforms into an oval each time as it makes contact with a gridded surface, before bouncing back up and regaining its circular form.**",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback on the caption is as follows:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is mostly accurate but contains one key inaccuracy at the beginning. It states that the hand \"grasps a white circular ball,\" but the video shows the hand grasping a black circular *outline*, which then *becomes* a solid white ball upon being picked up.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption successfully covers all the main actions in the video: the grasping, the throwing, the ball's transformation, the bounce, and the deformation upon impact.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Chronological Order:** The caption violates the instruction to present actions in chronological order. The ball is not white when it is first grasped; it transforms from an outline to a solid white ball *as* it is grasped. The description reverses this sequence.\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The rest of the caption is clear, concise, and effectively describes the motion without using subjective or speculative language. It correctly identifies the \"squash and stretch\" motion of the ball as it deforms into an oval and returns to a circle.\n\nIn summary, the caption is well-written but fails on the critical instruction of maintaining strict chronological order for the initial action, leading to an inaccurate description of the event's sequence.",
