    "pre_caption": "The player, holding the black assault rifle, approaches a metal staircase in a worn, beige building exterior, with the tank and some crates visible in the background. As the player moves closer to the staircase, an enemy soldier appears at the base, marked with an orange diamond and labeled 'ARMED.' The player begins firing at the enemy soldier, who returns fire, causing a bright muzzle flash. The player continues to advance, aiming through the red dot sight at the enemy soldier, who is now partially obscured by the staircase. The player moves under the staircase, with the view partially obstructed by the structure's beams, while the enemy soldier remains in sight. The player advances further, with the enemy soldier now more visible, and another enemy soldier appears in the background. The player continues to engage the enemy soldier, who is now closer, while another enemy soldier is seen further away, also marked with an orange diamond.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video displays a first-person perspective of a black assault rifle, equipped with a red dot sight, held by an unseen player. In the environment, a large, dark green, boxy military vehicle, resembling a tank or armored personnel carrier, is present. Figures in dark, indistinct clothing, representing enemy soldiers, are visible at various distances, sometimes partially obscured by structures. Overlaying the view are game interface elements: a blue minimap with white and blue icons in the lower left corner, blue and white numerical displays for health and ammunition in the lower right corner, and orange and blue diamond-shaped objective markers indicating locations or targets.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains several factual inaccuracies regarding the events in the video. The enemy soldier is initially positioned at the top of the staircase, not at the base, and is visible from the beginning of the video, not appearing later. The caption incorrectly states the enemy returns fire; only the player's muzzle flash is visible. The player's view is obscured by the metal staircase structure, not plants. Furthermore, the caption misinterprets the engagement by describing a single enemy. In the video, the player shoots and eliminates the first enemy on the stairs, after which a second, more distant enemy becomes visible in the background. The caption should be corrected to state that the player aims and fires at an enemy at the top of the stairs, eliminating them, and then shifts focus to a second enemy in the distance.",

In the background, a tank and some crates are present. The player advances towards the staircase, aims their red dot sight at the enemy, and fires, creating a muzzle flash and eliminating the target. The player then moves under the staircase, with the view partially obstructed by its metal structure. As they emerge, a second enemy soldier is spotted in the distance, and the player aims their weapon towards this new target.",
