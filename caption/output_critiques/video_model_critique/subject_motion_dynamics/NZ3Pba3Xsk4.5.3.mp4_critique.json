    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a close-up of an informational display, and the camera slowly pans right to reveal additional displays, display windows, and a wooden hallway. The scene then transitions to an outdoor zoo enclosure, where an adult elephant stands mostly still behind several tall columns. The elephant does not move significantly during this part of the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **disappearing from the frame**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how they exit, whether through subject movement or camera movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video begins with a full shot of an informational display featuring a timeline and photographs of several elephants, each labeled with names and dates, and accompanied by Japanese and English text describing the introduction of elephants at the Higashiyama Zoo and Botanical Gardens. The display includes images of elephants of varying sizes and ages, with some shown individually and others in small groups, and uses icons and lines to indicate their presence over time. The camera then pans right to include other elephant displays, display windows, and a wooden hallway. The scene shifts to an outdoor zoo enclosure with multiple tall, cylindrical columns and a fenced area. Within the enclosure, an adult elephant with gray, wrinkled skin and visible tusks stands partially obscured behind the columns. The video also includes a scene where several elephants are walking slowly.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately describes the camera’s slow pan across the informational displays and hallway, and it correctly notes the transition to the outdoor zoo enclosure with elephants walking behind columns. However, the caption could be improved by specifying that the transition between the indoor and outdoor scenes is a continuous pan rather than a hard or soft cut, as the camera movement flows smoothly from the interior to the exterior. Additionally, the caption should clarify that the elephants are visible through the columns and are walking in a group, which is a notable pattern in their movement. The mention of “display windows” is slightly ambiguous and could be clarified as “glass display cases” or “exhibit windows” if that is what is shown. Otherwise, the caption is concise, chronological, and avoids unnecessary details or subjective language. Suggested revision: “The video begins with a full shot of an informational display, and the camera slowly pans right, passing additional displays and glass exhibit windows before moving through a wooden hallway. The camera continues panning to reveal an outdoor zoo enclosure, where several elephants walk together behind tall columns.”",
