    "pre_caption": "The video features a humanoid figure with a featureless white face and short, dark gray, side-swept hair, seated and operating a black computer monitor. The figure is wearing a short-sleeved t-shirt with a vibrant tie-dye pattern displaying swirls of blue, green, yellow, orange, and pink. In the blurred background to the left, another humanoid figure stands with arms akimbo, visible only from the chest down, wearing a light-colored, possibly gray, top and light-colored jeans. Further in the background to the right, a more indistinct, silhouetted humanoid figure is also present. In the foreground at the bottom of the frame, there is a blurred outline resembling a device, possibly a computer tower, adding depth to the scene. White text overlay reading 'Nathan Leroux' is visible in the bottom right corner and gradually disappears in a dynamic and cool manner as the video progresses.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the motion and dynamics of the main subject while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects' movements.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video centers on a humanoid figure with a featureless white face, lacking eyes, a nose, and a mouth, and short, dark gray, side-swept hair. This figure is seated and appears to be interacting with a black computer monitor. The main subject is wearing a short-sleeved t-shirt with a vibrant tie-dye pattern displaying swirls of blue, green, yellow, orange, and pink. In the middle ground to the left, another humanoid figure stands with arms akimbo, visible only from the chest down, wearing a light-colored, possibly gray, top and light-colored jeans. Further in the background to the right, a more indistinct, silhouetted humanoid figure is also present. White text overlay reading \"Nathan Leroux\" is visible in the bottom right corner, gradually disappearing in a dynamic and visually appealing manner as the video progresses.**",

The description of the main figure's hair and tie-dye shirt, the background figures, and the blurred foreground object should be removed. The caption inaccurately states the figure is \"operating\" the computer, as the figure is completely stationary. It also contains the speculative word \"possibly\" and the subjective adjective \"cool,\" both of which are forbidden. Furthermore, there is a factual error: the text overlay reads \"Nathan L,\" not \"Nathan Leroux.\" The caption should be revised to briefly state that all figures are motionless and then describe the only movement in the video, which is the text in the corner glitching and fading out.",
