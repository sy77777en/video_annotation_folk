It correctly describes the visual elements of the scene, including the street, buildings, skyscraper, lamps, and flags. The description of the camera's forward motion is also correct.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption completely covers the main visual information and the only motion present in the video.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption does not fully adhere to the instructions. The main issue is that it includes a detailed description of the static scene (\"a street lined with tall buildings on both sides,\" \"illuminated by street lamps, and American flags are visible\"). The instructions explicitly state to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" Since this is a scenery shot with no moving subjects, the description should be very brief or focus only on the camera's movement. The current caption dedicates too much text to static details that should be omitted.",
