    "pre_caption": "The video shows a man with short hair approaching a turnstile in a subway station. He is wearing a long, dark coat and white shoes.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a man with short hair passing through the turnstile. He is wearing a long, dark coat and white shoes, with his back turned slightly towards the camera. The setting is a subway station, indicated by the signage for the \"Red Line trains\" above the turnstiles. **",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is inaccurate and does not fully adhere to the instructions.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption makes a speculative statement by identifying the subject as a \"man with short hair.\" Due to the lighting, distance, and angle, the subject's gender and hairstyle are not clearly discernible. The instructions explicitly state to \"Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain.\"\n*   **Completeness:** The caption fails to describe the entire motion in the video. After the person passes through the turnstile, the camera slowly pans to the right, showing the other turnstiles. This camera movement is a key part of the video's motion and is completely omitted from the description.\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   The caption violates the instruction to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" It includes descriptive details about the subject's clothing (\"long, dark coat and white shoes\") and the setting (\"The setting is clearly a subway station, with signage...\"), which are not descriptions of motion.\n    *   The description of the person's movement is presented in chronological order, which follows the instructions.\n\nIn summary, the caption is flawed because it includes speculative details, focuses too much on static appearance and setting instead of motion, and omits the significant camera pan that occurs in the second half of the video.",
