    "pre_caption": "The video shows a small, light brown tabby kitten with distinct dark stripes and a soft, short coat, resting on a black, rounded surface, possibly a cushion or bag. The kitten's front paw is extended forward, relaxed over the edge of the surface, and its head is slightly tilted. The kitten's ears are pointed and upright, and its whiskers are visible against its face, adding to its serene appearance. The background is blurred, with a mix of light and dark colors, suggesting an indoor setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a small, light brown tabby kitten with distinct dark stripes and a soft, short coat. The kitten is resting on a flat, black surface, possibly a cushion or bag. It briefly opens its eyes before closing them again and stretches its claws while extending its body, suggesting a moment of wakefulness before returning to rest. Its ears are pointed and upright, and its front paw is extended forward, relaxed over the edge of the surface. The kitten's head is slightly tilted, and its whiskers are visible against its face, adding to its serene appearance. The overall posture and expression convey a sense of calm and restfulness.**",

  "generated_critique": "No, this caption is not good. It fails to adhere to the core instructions provided.\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is inaccurate because it fails to describe the subject's motion. It portrays the scene as completely static, but the kitten's head subtly droops lower as it sleeps throughout the video.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is incomplete because it entirely omits a description of the subject's movement, which is the primary focus of the instructions. Instead, it provides a detailed but irrelevant physical description.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The caption completely fails in this regard. It focuses on the kitten's appearance (\"small, light brown tabby kitten with distinct dark stripes and a soft, short coat\") and static posture, rather than its movement.\n*   **Avoid Speculation:** The caption violates this rule by using speculative phrases like \"possibly a cushion or bag\" and \"suggesting an indoor setting.\"\n*   **Avoid Subjectivity:** The caption uses the subjective adjective \"serene,\" which is explicitly forbidden.\n*   **Conciseness:** For a video with very little action, the caption is overly detailed about the subject's appearance instead of briefly describing the subtle motion or lack thereof.",
