    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a dark background and the text 'OMOTE REAL-TIME FACE TRACKING & PROJECTION MAPPING' displayed prominently. As the frames progress, the lighting gradually increases, revealing more details of the woman's hair and the equipment in the background. The woman remains stationary, facing away from the camera, while the light source in front of her becomes more intense, illuminating her silhouette. The background equipment, including a camera and lights, becomes more visible as the lighting continues to brighten. The video concludes with the woman's silhouette clearly outlined against the bright light, and the text remains on the screen.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a woman with long, straight hair, partially visible on the right side as she faces away from the camera. She is wearing a light-colored garment. The lighting is dim, with a bright light source in front of her, creating a silhouette effect. The setting appears to be a studio environment, with equipment visible in the background.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is excellent and adheres to all the provided instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:** The description is highly accurate. It correctly identifies that the subject, a woman, remains stationary throughout the video. It also accurately notes the primary visual change: the gradual increase in lighting, which makes the subject's silhouette and the background equipment more visible.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption provides a complete account of the visual information in the clip. It describes the initial state with the text on a dark screen, the progression of the lighting change, the subject's lack of movement, and the final, more illuminated scene.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Motion Description:** The caption perfectly follows the instruction for a static subject by stating, \"The woman remains stationary.\" It correctly focuses on the only dynamic element, the change in lighting, which is the most significant \"action\" in the scene.\n*   **Chronological Order:** The description is presented in a clear, chronological sequence, mirroring the progression of the video.\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand. It provides necessary detail without being verbose.\n*   **Objectivity:** The caption is objective, avoiding any subjective, emotional, or speculative language.\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or markdown, as requested.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a well-written, accurate, and complete description that perfectly aligns with all the given guidelines.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins in a dark room with the text 'OMOTE REAL-TIME FACE TRACKING & PROJECTION MAPPING' displayed. A woman, seen from behind, remains stationary throughout the clip. As the scene progresses, the lighting gradually increases, making her silhouette more distinct and slowly revealing background equipment like cameras and lights. The text remains visible as the scene brightens to a close.",
