    "pre_caption": "The video shows three individuals walking through a narrow, ancient stone passage with high walls on either side. The first person, wearing an orange top and black pants, leads the group, followed by the second person in a white hat, striped shirt, and denim shorts with a red backpack. The third person, wearing a blue and white jacket, appears from the lower right of the frame and follows the group. The pathway is paved with red bricks, and there are shadows cast on the walls, indicating the presence of sunlight. The group continues to walk forward, with the second person gradually moving ahead of the third person.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video, filmed from a first-person POV, follows three people walking through an ancient structure. Initially, the first person, wearing an orange top, black trousers, and carrying a blue backpack, leads the group. The second person, following closely, is dressed in a white hat, a striped shirt, and denim shorts, carrying a red backpack. Later, a third person appears from the lower right of the frame, positioned at the very end, with only his upper body visible, wearing a blue and white jacket. The people occupy only half the frame's height, emphasizing the ancient stone walls and pathway surrounding them.**",

  "generated_critique": "Feedback on the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is mostly accurate but contains a few errors. The person leading the group appears to be wearing a blue shirt, not an orange one. The description of the third person (in the blue and white jacket) \"appearing from the lower right\" is slightly misleading, as they are present from the start, seemingly next to the camera operator. The statement that the \"second person gradually moving ahead of the third person\" is also inaccurate; their relative positions remain consistent as the camera simply follows the person with the red backpack.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption identifies the main subjects and the general action. However, it focuses heavily on describing the subjects' clothing and the static environment (passage, bricks, shadows) rather than providing a detailed description of the motion itself. The primary action is simply \"walking forward.\"\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The caption does not adhere well to this instruction. A significant portion is dedicated to describing appearances (\"white hat, striped shirt, and denim shorts with a red backpack\") and the setting (\"narrow, ancient stone passage with high walls,\" \"paved with red bricks\"), which detracts from the focus on movement.\n*   **Chronological Order:** The description of the movement is chronological.\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is not as concise as it could be due to the extensive descriptions of clothing and scenery.\n*   **Subjective Language:** The use of \"ancient\" is a slightly subjective descriptor for the passage.\n*   **Clarity:** The description of the relative motion between the second and third person is unclear and inaccurate.\n\nIn summary, the caption is too descriptive of static elements like clothing and the environment and fails to focus primarily on the subjects' motion as instructed. It also contains factual inaccuracies regarding color and the relative movement of the individuals. A better caption would focus on the group's collective movement through the passage from the perspective of someone walking with them.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a first-person perspective, the camera moves forward, following a group of people walking through a narrow passage flanked by high, textured stone walls. A person wearing a white hat and a red backpack walks in the center of the frame, moving steadily forward. Further ahead, another person in a blue shirt walks in the same direction. To the right, a person in a blue and white jacket walks alongside, keeping pace with the camera's movement. As the group proceeds along the red brick path, their long shadows stretch out in front of them.",
