    "pre_caption": "The video shows a man with his upper body and head trapped in a ceiling crack, wearing a white shirt, a blue striped tie, and dark pants. He is holding a notebook in his right hand, and the crack in the ceiling radiates outward with visible cracks extending from his head. The camera angle is from a third-person perspective, positioned behind another person whose head is partially visible in the lower right corner. The man remains in the same position throughout the frames, with no significant movement or change in his posture.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a man trapped in the ceiling, visible from mid-thigh to below the chest. He is wearing a white shirt, a blue striped tie, and dark pants, and is holding a notebook in his right hand. The camera captures this scene from a third-person over-the-shoulder perspective, positioned behind another person whose head is partially visible in the lower right corner. The focus remains on the man in the ceiling, emphasizing his unusual position and attire.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good because it fails to follow the core instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:** The description of the visual content is accurate. The man is indeed stuck in the ceiling, wearing the described clothes, holding a notebook, and remains still.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is very complete in its description of the static scene.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption fails to adhere to several key instructions:\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The instructions state, \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" The caption does the opposite, focusing almost entirely on static details like clothing, the object being held, and the appearance of the ceiling crack.\n*   **Brevity for No-Movement Scenes:** The instructions specify, \"If the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\" This caption is very detailed and only mentions the lack of movement at the very end, which contradicts the instruction for a brief and concise statement.\n*   **Avoid Appearance Details:** The instructions say, \"Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects.\" The caption unnecessarily describes the man's shirt, tie, and pants.\n\nIn summary, while the caption accurately describes the image, it functions as a detailed scene description rather than the required concise report on the subject's motion (or lack thereof). A correct caption would be much shorter, simply stating that the subject remains motionless.",
