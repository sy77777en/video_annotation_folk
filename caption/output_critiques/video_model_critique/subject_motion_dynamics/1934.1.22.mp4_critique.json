    "pre_caption": "The young man, standing on a black platform, begins to step down onto a white ledge. He continues to move forward on the ledge, maintaining his balance. The young man then crouches down and starts to lower himself. He carefully maneuvers himself off the ledge, using his hands for support. The young man swings his legs over the edge and lands on the ground below. He stands up and looks forward, completing his descent.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a young man dressed in white attire with orange stripes, including a long-sleeved shirt, pants, gloves, and a cap, with a light skin tone.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is good, but there are areas for improvement in accuracy and conciseness.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n- The caption states the man \"begins to step down onto a white ledge,\" but the video starts with him already in the middle of this action.\n- It says he \"continues to move forward on the ledge,\" which implies a longer walk than the one or two quick steps he actually takes before crouching.\n- The description \"swings his legs over the edge\" is not entirely accurate. He crouches, places his hands on the ledge, and lowers his body forward and down, landing on his feet. He doesn't swing his legs over the side.\n\n**Completeness:**\n- The caption successfully covers the entire sequence of the man's descent in chronological order.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n- The caption adheres well to most instructions: it's in chronological order, focuses on motion, uses simple language, and avoids speculation.\n- The word \"carefully\" is slightly subjective but is a reasonable interpretation of his controlled movement.\n\nIn summary, the caption correctly identifies the overall action but could be more precise in describing the specific movements, particularly the start of the action and the method of dismounting from the ledge.",
