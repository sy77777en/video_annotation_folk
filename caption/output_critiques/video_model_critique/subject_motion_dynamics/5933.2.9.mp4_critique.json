    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a man with short, dark hair, seen from behind as he walks through a field of tall, dry grasses. He is wearing a brown jacket and carries a large, beige backpack with multiple compartments. The backpack has a rectangular patch on the back. The man appears to be moving forward, surrounded by the swaying grasses, which are light brown and reach up to his shoulders. The scene conveys a sense of exploration or journey through a natural setting.**",

  "generated_critique": "Feedback on the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subject as a man with short, dark hair, wearing a brown jacket and a beige backpack. His action of walking through a field of tall grasses is also described correctly.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is very complete. It not only describes the primary subject's motion but also includes the secondary motion of the grasses swaying. It also provides context by describing the background.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The caption successfully describes the subject's motion (\"walks through,\" \"continues to move forward steadily\") and the motion of the environment (\"grasses sway gently\"). This adheres well to the core instruction.\n*   **Subject Appearance:** The instruction states, \"Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects.\" Since there is only one person, the detailed description of his hair, jacket, and backpack is not strictly necessary. A more concise opening like \"A man carrying a backpack walks...\" would be more in line with this rule.\n*   **Avoid Inference:** The final phrase, \"indicating an outdoor, natural environment,\" is a slight inference. While it's an obvious conclusion, the instructions prefer direct description over interpretation. Simply stating that the background contains trees and a cloudy sky is sufficient.\n\n**Overall:** The caption is very good, accurate, and descriptive. To align it more perfectly with the instructions, it could be made slightly more concise by reducing the details of the man's appearance and removing the interpretive phrase at the end.",
