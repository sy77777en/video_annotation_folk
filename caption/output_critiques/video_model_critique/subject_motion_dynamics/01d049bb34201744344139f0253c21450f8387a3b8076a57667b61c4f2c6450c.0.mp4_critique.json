    "pre_caption": "The video begins with an aerial view of a village, showing several houses with white and red roofs, surrounded by green fields and patches of trees. As the camera moves forward, more houses and buildings come into view, including some with distinct tower-like structures. The camera continues to ascend, revealing a larger area of the village with more houses and the surrounding landscape, which includes rolling hills and fields. The video concludes with a wide view of the village and the expansive green fields, with mountains visible in the background.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption does not fully follow the instruction, as it focuses on describing the scenery and the appearance of the village rather than the motion of the subject, which in this case is the camera. The caption should specifically describe the camera's movement in chronological order, such as \"The camera begins with an aerial view above the village, then moves forward and gradually ascends, revealing more of the village and the surrounding landscape, and finally pulls back to show a wide view with mountains in the background.\" Details about the colors of roofs, the presence of tower-like structures, and the appearance of the landscape are unnecessary unless they are essential for differentiating between multiple subjects, which is not the case here. The caption should be revised to focus solely on the camera's motion and the sequence of views it presents.",
