    "pre_caption": "The video shows a woman seated at a table, wearing a maroon vest with a name tag that reads 'Susan' over a white shirt. She is holding chopsticks in her right hand above a plate of food, which contains a mix of vegetables and possibly some fried items. The table also has a glass of iced tea, a bowl of soup, and another plate with green vegetables. The background is dark, emphasizing the woman and the table setting. The woman remains still throughout the video, with no significant changes in her posture or the environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a woman seated at a table, wearing a maroon vest with a name tag that reads \"Susan\" over a white shirt. She has medium-length dark hair and is wearing glasses. The woman is holding chopsticks in her right hand above a plate of food, sitting upright and remaining still. The table is set with various dishes, including a plate of greens and a glass of iced tea. The lighting focuses on her, highlighting her calm and composed demeanor.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is mostly accurate in describing the visual elements of the scene. However, it violates the instruction to \"Avoid speculative statements\" by using the phrase \"possibly some fried items.\"\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is overly complete, providing excessive detail about static elements, which contradicts the instructions.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The primary failure is the lack of focus on motion. The instructions state, \"Focus on the subject's motion\" and \"If the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\" This caption dedicates the majority of its text to describing the woman's appearance, the food, and the setting, only mentioning the lack of movement as an afterthought. The core information—that the subject is completely still—is buried under unnecessary descriptive details.\n*   **Unnecessary Details:** The caption describes the woman's clothing (\"maroon vest with a name tag that reads 'Susan' over a white shirt\") and the specific items on the table in detail. This violates the instruction to \"Avoid describing the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects.\" Since she is the only subject, these details are superfluous.\n*   **Speculation:** As mentioned, the use of \"possibly\" is a direct violation of the rule against speculative language.\n\nA better caption would have been: \"A woman sits still at a dining table, holding chopsticks over a plate of food. She remains motionless throughout the video.\" This is concise, focuses entirely on the (lack of) motion, and adheres to all instructions.",
