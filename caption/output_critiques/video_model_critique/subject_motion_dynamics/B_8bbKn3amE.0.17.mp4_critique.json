  "generated_critique": "The caption is good, but it could be improved.\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is accurate. It correctly identifies the subject as a snow-covered mountain and accurately describes the camera's motion as gliding alongside the peak. The details about the rock faces, glaciers, blue sky, and clouds are all present in the video.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is complete, capturing the essential elements of the scene and the primary motion within the video, which is the camera's movement.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths:** The caption correctly focuses on the motion, which in this scenery shot is the camera's movement (\"glides smoothly alongside\"). It presents the information in a clear, single paragraph. It avoids speculation and accurately describes what is visible.\n*   **Areas for Improvement:** The caption violates the instruction to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\" by using the words \"breathtaking\" and \"dramatic.\" These words add an emotional interpretation rather than a purely objective description of the scene.\n\nIn summary, the caption effectively describes the video's content and motion but fails to adhere strictly to the instruction to avoid subjective language. Removing \"breathtaking\" and \"dramatic\" would make it fully compliant.",
