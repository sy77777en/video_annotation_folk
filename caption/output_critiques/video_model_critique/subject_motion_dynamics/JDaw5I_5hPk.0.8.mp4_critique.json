  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately describes the motion of the waves crashing against the stationary rock. However, it violates the instructions by including the subjective phrase \"creating a dynamic and powerful scene.\" The instructions explicitly state to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" Additionally, the introductory phrase \"The video shows\" is unnecessary. The description should be revised to remove the subjective assessment and the introductory clause for a more direct and objective account of the motion.",
