    "pre_caption": "In a gazebo-like structure with ornate metal railings and a wooden roof, a person in a Spider-Man costume is initially crouched down. The person begins to rise, using their hands for support, and gradually stands up. Once fully standing, the person adjusts their posture and appears to be preparing for further action. The background shows a park-like setting with trees, buildings, and a few people in the distance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a person dressed in a Spider-Man costume, characterized by its iconic red and blue colors with web patterns. This individual is positioned inside a gazebo-like structure, initially crouching low to the ground. As the video progresses, the person stands up, revealing more of the costume's details, including the mask covering the head and black sneakers. Another person, dressed in a Spider-Man Noir costume, is visible in the background, walking. The Spider-Man-costumed individual remains the central focus throughout the video, with their movements transitioning from a crouched to a standing position.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good for this video. Here is a detailed breakdown of its shortcomings:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption inaccurately states that the person \"begins to rise, using their hands for support.\" The person's hands are in the air and do not touch the ground to provide support as they stand up.\n*   The phrase \"appears to be preparing for further action\" is speculative and violates the instruction to \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options.\"\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is significantly incomplete. It completely omits a very prominent action: at the 00:01 mark, a black-gloved hand (belonging to the other costumed person) enters the frame from the right and reaches directly toward the camera before pulling back.\n*   It fails to mention the second subject, a person in a black costume, who is visible on the right side of the gazebo throughout the video and takes a few steps. The instructions require describing the motion of secondary subjects.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Failure to describe interactions:** The caption misses the clear interaction of the black-gloved hand reaching toward the camera, violating the instruction to describe interactions between subjects.\n*   **Failure to describe all subjects:** By omitting the person in the black costume, the caption fails to follow the guideline to \"briefly mention the motion of secondary subjects.\"\n*   **Failure to avoid speculation:** The use of \"appears to be\" directly contradicts a key negative constraint.\n*   **Failure to describe with clarity:** The description of the main subject standing up is not precise, as noted in the accuracy section.\n\nIn summary, the caption is not good because it contains factual inaccuracies, uses forbidden speculative language, and omits multiple key subjects and their actions, resulting in an incomplete and misleading description of the video's content.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a low-angle perspective inside an ornate gazebo, a person in a red and blue Spider-Man costume is crouched on the floor. They begin to rise to a standing position without using their hands. As they do, a large, black-gloved hand enters the frame from the right, reaches toward the camera, and then retracts. In the background, a second person in a black costume stands on the right and takes a few steps. The gazebo is in a public square with buildings and bare trees visible.",
