  "generated_critique": "The caption is excellent and adheres to all instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the double rainbow, the right-to-left panning motion of the camera, and the elements that are progressively revealed, such as trees, power lines, a fence, and houses.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is complete, covering the entire video from start to finish. It chronologically details how the view changes due to the camera's movement, providing a full picture of the video's content.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Chronological Order:** The caption perfectly follows the chronological progression of the camera pan, describing what is seen at the beginning and what is revealed as the video continues.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** Since there are no moving subjects, the caption correctly focuses on the motion of the camera, describing the pan and its effect on the scene. This is the appropriate way to handle a scenery shot.\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, clear, and natural. The description is informative without being overly detailed.\n*   **Objectivity:** The caption avoids subjective or emotional language and speculative statements, sticking to a factual description of the visual information.\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single, coherent paragraph as requested.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens on a double rainbow arcing across a gray sky, with treetops and power lines in the foreground. The camera pans from right to left, following the curve of the rainbow. As it moves, the view expands to reveal a residential street with a fence, houses, and a palm tree, all under the vibrant double rainbow.",
