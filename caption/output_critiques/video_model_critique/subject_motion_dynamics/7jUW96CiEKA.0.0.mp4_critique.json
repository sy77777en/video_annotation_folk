    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up view of a large, leafless tree, focusing on its thick trunk and sprawling branches against a clear blue sky. The camera slowly pans to the left, maintaining the focus on the tree's trunk and branches, which remain barren and devoid of leaves. The sunlight creates a lens flare effect as it filters through the branches, adding a subtle glow to the scene. The camera continues to move left, revealing more of the tree's structure and the intricate patterns on its bark. The video concludes with the camera still panning left, providing a comprehensive view of the tree's trunk and branches from a slightly different angle.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a large, leafless tree with a thick, textured trunk and numerous sprawling branches extending outward. The bark is rough and gray, with visible patterns and knots. The branches are bare, showcasing a network of smaller twigs against the sky. The tree's imposing structure and intricate details are highlighted, emphasizing its size and natural complexity.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is excellent and adheres to all instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subject as a large, leafless tree and accurately describes the only motion in the video, which is the slow leftward pan of the camera. The mention of the lens flare is also a precise detail.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is complete, covering the entire sequence of the camera's movement from the beginning to the end of the clip and how this motion reveals different aspects of the static tree.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Motion Description:** The instructions state that if the subject has no movement, this should be mentioned briefly. The caption correctly handles this by describing the tree as static (\"remain barren and devoid of leaves\") and focusing on the camera's motion, which is the only dynamic element in the scene.\n*   **Chronological Order:** The description of the camera pan is presented in a clear, chronological sequence.\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand, providing a clear picture of the video's content without unnecessary jargon.\n*   **Objectivity:** The caption avoids subjective or emotional language, sticking to factual descriptions of what is visible.\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single, well-structured paragraph as requested.\n\nThe caption effectively describes a scene with a static subject by focusing on the camera's movement, which is the correct approach according to the guidelines.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video presents a low-angle view looking up at a large, leafless tree, its thick trunk and sprawling branches set against a clear blue sky. The camera pans slowly and continuously to the left throughout the clip. As it moves, the sun creates a bright lens flare through the bare branches, and the shifting perspective reveals more of the tree's massive structure and the texture of its bark.",
