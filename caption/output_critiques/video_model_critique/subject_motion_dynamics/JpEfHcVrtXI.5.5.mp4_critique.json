A large, winged creature with a golden glow swoops down from the top of the screen, intercepts the smaller creature, and a burst of light propels them both rapidly upwards and out of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the main subjects in this video exhibit **atypical motion, posture, or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **In a mystical, dark forest setting, a large, luminous blue-white orb is encased within a dark, swirling, vine-like structure, emitting powerful beams of purple and white light. The scene is a 2D game environment presented from a side view, featuring an unconventional character design. A small, bipedal creature, entirely white and glowing with long ears and a slender body, is present.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption inaccurately describes the subject's motion and omits a significant portion of the video's action. The small creature does not \"jump\" but is launched upwards after the large central orb disappears in a flash of light. Its initial ascent is vertical and central, not towards the right side of the frame. Most importantly, the caption completely misses the hard cut at 00:06. It fails to mention the subsequent scene where the creature flies upwards through a dark passage while being pursued from above by a large, dark, winged creature. The description of the creature landing on a tree and jumping is entirely fabricated and does not occur in the video.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a 2D video game scene, a small, glowing white creature is on a platform below a large, pulsating blue orb of light. After an \"ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED\" notification appears, the orb disappears in a brilliant flash, launching the small creature straight up the center of the screen. The scene then cuts to a dark, narrow passage where the small creature flies rapidly upwards, pursued from above by a large, dark, winged creature that swoops down after it.",
