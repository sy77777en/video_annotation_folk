However, it includes a detailed description of the static scenery (\"a blurry, out-of-focus shot of a moss-covered stone structure in the foreground. In the background, a line of green trees stands against a bright, white sky.\"). According to the instructions, for a scenery shot without salient subjects, the caption should briefly note the lack of motion in one to three sentences rather than describing the scene in detail. The first two sentences should be removed or condensed to focus solely on the motion aspect, as the description of the static elements is redundant.",
