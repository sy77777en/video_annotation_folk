    "pre_caption": "The video begins with an aerial view of the Liwa Desert in the United Arab Emirates, showing the winding road and the surrounding sand dunes. The text 'LIWA Desert, United Arab Emirates' appears on the screen and then fades away. The camera gradually zooms in on the road, following the off-road vehicle as it drives along the path, leaving a trail of dust behind it. The vehicle continues to move forward, navigating the curves of the road, with the dust trail becoming more pronounced. The camera maintains its focus on the vehicle, capturing its movement and the dust trail it creates as it progresses along the road.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video showcases a vast desert landscape with undulating sand dunes in shades of golden brown. A prominent feature is a winding road cutting through the dunes. An off-road vehicle is seen traveling along this road, creating a trail of dust as it moves. The car appears small in comparison to the expansive desert.**",

  "generated_critique": "Feedback on the caption:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is mostly accurate in its description of the events. However, the statement that the \"camera gradually zooms in\" is incorrect; the camera maintains a relatively consistent altitude while tracking the vehicle. Also, the dust trail is prominent from the start and doesn't necessarily become \"more pronounced.\"\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption describes the general movement but misses the specific action of the car drifting or power-sliding around the curve, which is a key visual element.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Focus on Subject's Motion:** The caption fails to adhere to this core instruction. It spends significant time describing the on-screen text (\"The text 'LIWA Desert...' appears on the screen and then fades away\") and the camera's actions (\"The camera gradually zooms in,\" \"The camera maintains its focus\"), rather than concentrating solely on the car's movement.\n    *   **Conciseness:** The description is not concise due to the inclusion of redundant information about the camera and the on-screen text. The final sentence, in particular, repeats information already established.\n    *   **Chronological Order:** The caption correctly presents the actions in chronological order.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "An off-road vehicle power-slides around a curve on a desert road, kicking up a large cloud of dust. After completing the turn, the vehicle straightens its path and continues driving along the road, leaving a dust trail behind it.",
