  "generated_critique": "The caption includes speculative information (\"likely in a historic district like New Orleans\"), which the instructions explicitly forbid. It also focuses heavily on describing the static scenery (\"Parked cars line the wet, cracked road, and buildings with traditional architecture are visible on both sides\") instead of the subjects' motion, as required. The description of the movement is too general. The caption should be revised to remove speculation and scenic details, and instead provide a more specific description of the subjects' actions, such as: \"On a foggy street, a group of three people walks from right to left across an intersection, while on the left sidewalk, one person walks away from the camera and another stands still.\"",
