    "pre_caption": "The video shows three individuals walking down a stone staircase in an ancient site. The person on the left, wearing an orange shirt and a blue backpack, is leading the way. The person in the center, wearing a striped shirt and a red backpack, follows closely behind. The person on the right, wearing a blue jacket with a white and dark blue pattern, is at the end of the group. The background consists of stone walls and a low ceiling, indicating an ancient or historical setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video, filmed in first-person POV, follows three people walking through an ancient site. On the left, a person is fully visible, wearing a bright orange shirt, black pants, and a blue backpack, with short dark hair. In the center, a person is shown from the upper body, wearing a striped shirt, a white hat, and a red backpack. On the right, a person is visible from above the knees, wearing a blue jacket with a white and dark blue pattern, and has short hair. The individuals are descending a stone staircase, with the person on the left leading the way. The focus is on their movement and attire, with the ancient stone surroundings providing context.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is factually accurate. It correctly identifies the three individuals, their clothing, their backpacks, and their general action of walking down a staircase.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption describes the main elements of the scene.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption fails to follow several key instructions:\n\n1.  **Focus on Motion:** The primary instruction is to \"Focus on the subject's motion.\" This caption dedicates the majority of its text to static descriptions: what each person is wearing, what color their backpack is, and their position relative to others (\"leading the way,\" \"in the center,\" \"at the end of the group\"). The actual motion is only briefly mentioned as \"walking down a stone staircase.\" It describes a static scene more than it describes an action.\n\n2.  **Avoid Redundant Details:** The instruction states to focus on motion \"rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" Describing the color of each person's shirt and backpack is precisely the kind of static detail that should be minimized in favor of describing the movement.\n\n3.  **Describe the Background:** The last sentence, \"The background consists of stone walls and a low ceiling, indicating an ancient or historical setting,\" describes the scenery, which is not the subject's motion. The inference \"indicating an ancient or historical setting\" also borders on interpretation, though it's a reasonable one.\n\nIn summary, the caption reads like a list of who is in the video and what they are wearing, rather than a dynamic description of their movement. A better caption would have focused on the action itself, for example: \"Three men descend a narrow stone staircase, walking in a single file line down into a dark passageway.\" This revised version prioritizes the action (\"descend,\" \"walking\") and the manner of movement (\"in a single file line\") as instructed.",
