Additionally, the first sentence, \"This is a time-lapse video of a dramatic storm developing over a vast, open field,\" is introductory and should be omitted to focus solely on the description of motion as instructed. The description can be made more concise by directly describing the movement. A better version would be: \"In this time-lapse, dark clouds rapidly swirl and roll across the sky above an open field, while a sheet of rain is visible falling and moving across the landscape in the distance.\"",
