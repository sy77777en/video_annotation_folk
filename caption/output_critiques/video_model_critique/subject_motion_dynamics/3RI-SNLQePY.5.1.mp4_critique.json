    "pre_caption": "The character starts walking down a street lined with buildings that have a distorted, artistic look, with windows and walls featuring black and white patterns. The sky is a vibrant pink, creating a stark contrast with the urban environment. The character continues to walk forward, passing by a green structure on the right side of the street. The character turns slightly to the left, revealing more of the street and additional buildings. The character walks past a signboard with a purple and white design, which becomes more prominent as the character moves forward. The character continues to walk down the street, with the signboard now fully visible on the right side.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the main subjects in this video exhibit **atypical motion, posture, or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a unique character with a large, round purple head, wearing a colorful, patterned shirt with vibrant hues and beige pants. The character has green limbs and is seen from a third-person perspective, akin to a video game, with the camera following it down a street. The character's head is adorned with a strap in white, black, and purple, and it has teal feet. The setting includes urban elements like buildings with a textured, artistic appearance and a bright pink sky, adding to the surreal atmosphere. A signboard with a similar color scheme becomes visible towards the end of the video.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is accurate and follows a chronological order. However, it could be improved in several ways to better adhere to the instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:** The description of the character's movements and the objects they pass is factually correct. The character walks down a street, passes a green structure, and then a signboard.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is overly complete in its description of the static environment. It dedicates significant text to the artistic style of the buildings and the color of the sky, which detracts from the primary instruction to focus on the subject's motion.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The caption deviates from this core instruction by providing extensive descriptions of the static scenery (\"buildings that have a distorted, artistic look,\" \"vibrant pink sky\").\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is repetitive. Phrases like \"starts walking,\" \"continues to walk forward,\" and \"continues to walk down the street\" describe the same ongoing action multiple times. This makes the description longer than necessary.\n*   **Objectivity:** The phrase \"distorted, artistic look\" is a subjective interpretation of the game's art style. While descriptive, a more objective phrasing would be preferable.\n\n**Revised Caption Example:**\n\nA video game character walks forward along a city street, passing a green guard tower on the right. The character then makes a slight left turn before continuing straight and walking past a purple and white signboard.",
