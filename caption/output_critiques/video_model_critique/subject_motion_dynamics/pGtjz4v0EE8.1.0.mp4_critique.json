The sentence \"The ancient amphitheater is illuminated by warm, golden lights, emphasizing its grand arches and structure against the dark sky\" should be removed. Additionally, the subjective adjective \"vibrant\" should be deleted. The description should be revised to focus solely on the camera's movement and the motion of the traffic, which is visible as light trails.",
