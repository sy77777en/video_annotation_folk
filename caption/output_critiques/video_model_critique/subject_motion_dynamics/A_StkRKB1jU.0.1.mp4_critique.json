    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A person in silhouette, wearing dark clothing and a red head covering, stands facing a broken window. Their facial features are mostly obscured, but a prominent nose is visible in profile. This individual holds and aims a dark, metallic, grappling hook-like device with a black cord out of the window. In the foreground, the back of a second person's head is visible until it moves out of the frame. This second person is wearing a clown mask with some visible hair at the back of it. The first person is positioned on the right of the frame, while the second person is positioned at the bottom right of the frame.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is good.\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subject as a person in silhouette, notes the broken window, and accurately describes the object as a \"grappling hook device.\" The sequence of actions—preparing, raising, and aiming—is precisely what occurs in the video.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is complete, covering the full range of motion within the clip. It describes both the initial preparation phase and the subsequent action of aiming the device.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Chronological Order:** The caption perfectly follows the chronological order of events, using \"prepares\" for the first action and \"then raise... and aim\" for the second.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** It uses specific action verbs like \"prepares,\" \"raise,\" and \"aim\" to describe the subject's movements and interaction with the object.\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The description is clear, concise, and uses simple, natural English.\n*   **Objectivity:** The caption is objective and avoids any speculation or emotional language.\n*   **Interaction with Object:** It clearly describes how the person interacts with the grappling hook device.\n\nThe caption successfully adheres to all provided instructions, resulting in a clear and factual description of the video's content.",
