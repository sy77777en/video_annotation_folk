Additionally, the sentence, \"The walls are a neutral, light color, accented by rectangular light fixtures,\" describes the static environment rather than the motion. This detail should be omitted to maintain focus on the movement, as instructed. The description of the motion itself is accurate but could be more concise by integrating the remaining elements into a single sentence.",
