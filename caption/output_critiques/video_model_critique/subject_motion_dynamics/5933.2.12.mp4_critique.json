As the camera moves to the right, more of the room becomes visible, revealing intricate wooden paneling and carvings on the wall. The camera continues to pan right, showing a detailed wooden structure with an arched opening and additional carvings. As the camera moves further, a large, ornate wooden carving with a central emblem and flanking figures comes into view. The final frames show the full details of the carving, which features a central shield with a crest and two figures on either side.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly identifies shadows cast on the wall as a \"window with a grid pattern\" and speculatively calls part of the wooden paneling a \"door.\" The instructions state to avoid describing anything uncertain. The description of the camera's motion is broken into multiple sentences, making it longer than necessary for a single, continuous movement. The caption should be revised to remove the inaccurate details and describe the continuous camera pan more concisely in a single, coherent statement.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a dark room, the camera pans right across a wall with ornate, carved wooden paneling, initially illuminated by shadows with a grid-like pattern. The pan reveals more of the intricate woodwork, including a small arched niche, before settling on a large, detailed carving of a coat of arms featuring a central shield flanked by two figures.",
