    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video captures an open-air football stadium during a game, with the stands densely packed with spectators, many of whom are wearing purple and yellow attire. The green football field is marked with white yard lines, a large \"N\" logo at midfield, and \"BIG\" logos. Players in white uniforms with purple numbers and helmets are visible on the field, engaged in gameplay. Two tall light towers with bright lights illuminate the stadium under an overcast sky. As the camera pans to the right, the building labeled \"RYAN FIELD\" becomes visible, along with several spectators in the foreground at the right corner of the scene. One individual, seen from the back, has light brown hair and wears a red visor. Next to this person, a man with light skin is shown in profile, looking towards the field; he wears a dark green baseball cap and a grey long-sleeved top. Partially visible behind him is a woman with blonde hair, and another spectator wearing a purple hat is seen in the lower right. The pan also reveals more of the field, including a purple end zone with \"WILDCATS\" written in white and a goalpost. Many other people are visible in the row.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is excellent and adheres to all instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the camera's movement as a slow pan to the right and precisely describes the sequence of what is revealed: the center of the field, the right end zone, the goalpost, the \"RYAN FIELD\" building, and spectators in the foreground.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is complete, covering the entire camera motion from start to finish. It effectively summarizes the visual journey across the stadium view.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Chronological Order:** The actions are described in the correct chronological sequence as the camera pans.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The caption correctly focuses on the primary motion, which is the camera pan, and accurately describes the players as \"standing.\"\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand, forming a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **Objectivity:** The description is factual and avoids any emotional, subjective, or speculative language.\n*   **Specificity:** It provides specific details like the direction of the pan and the name on the building, which adds valuable context without being overly descriptive.\n\nThe caption is a perfect example of the desired output. It correctly identifies the camera's movement as the main action and describes it and its effect on the scene clearly and chronologically.",
