  "generated_critique": "The caption contains subjective adjectives like \"breathtaking\" and \"spectacular,\" which should be removed. It also includes introductory and meta-phrasing such as \"This is a... video capturing\" and \"The video showcases,\" which should be deleted to describe the action more directly. The description of motion should be stated actively rather than as something being shown. The caption should be revised to focus solely on describing the visible motion in an objective manner. For example, it could state that in a time-lapse, clouds drift across the night sky as the stars and Milky Way rotate overhead from the perspective of a ship's bow.",
