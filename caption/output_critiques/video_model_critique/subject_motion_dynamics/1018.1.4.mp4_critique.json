The man in the white shirt then raises the cane above his head. The man in the black cardigan turns around and starts walking away, carrying a large bag.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the motion and dynamics of the main subject while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects' movements.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features two men in a room. The main subject is a man wearing a white short-sleeved shirt, a dark vest with gold buttons, and a green cap with red text. He has a mustache, and is wearing a watch on his left hand. The secondary subject is a man in a dark suit with a white shirt and tie, wearing a red Santa hat. He holds a large bag and an umbrella. The main subject then takes the umbrella from him. The two men are positioned close to each other, with the main subject in the foreground and the secondary subject slightly behind him. The interaction suggests a dynamic between them.**",

  "generated_critique": "Feedback on the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is inaccurate in its description of the subjects' clothing. The man on the left is wearing a green cardigan, not a black one. The man on the right is wearing a dark blue or black vest, not a green one (his hat and pants are green).\n\n**Completeness:** The caption successfully describes the main sequence of actions in the video. It captures the transfer of the cane, the raising of the cane, and the other man's departure.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Chronological Order:** The caption correctly presents the events in chronological order.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** It effectively focuses on the subjects' movements (\"takes,\" \"raises,\" \"turns around,\" \"starts walking away\").\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple and easy to understand.\n*   **Objectivity:** The description is objective and avoids speculation or emotional language.\n\n**Overall:** The caption follows the structural and stylistic instructions well, but its factual inaccuracy regarding the colors of the clothing is a significant flaw. A good caption must be accurate in all its descriptive details.",
