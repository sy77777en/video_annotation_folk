The video shows a static street scene, and the only movement is a text overlay that appears, reading \"Kyoto Japan\" and \"3 PM - August, 2021.\" The caption inaccurately refers to it as a \"handheld shot\" and states that people are \"walking and working,\" but the subjects are frozen in place. The description should be corrected to state that this is a still image with no subject movement, and it should also mention the text overlay that appears on screen.",
