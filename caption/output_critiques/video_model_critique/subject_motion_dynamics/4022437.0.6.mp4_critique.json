    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up view of the car's interior, focusing on the tan leather seats and the air vents located between the front and rear seats. As the camera moves backward, more of the car's interior becomes visible, including the door panels and the open rear door. The camera continues to pull back, revealing the full view of the car's interior and the open front door, showcasing the luxurious design and spacious seating area. Finally, the camera moves further back, providing a complete view of the car from the outside, with both the front and rear doors open, highlighting the elegant and high-quality finish of the vehicle.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the **main subject’s framing is not stable** throughout the video, so the description should reflect how their motion and dynamics contribute to this instability.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a black luxury sedan with its doors open, revealing a tan leather interior. The car's sleek design is highlighted by its shiny silver alloy wheels and aerodynamic shape. The interior showcases plush leather seats and a central console with air vents, emphasizing comfort and elegance. The open doors provide a clear view of the spacious and well-appointed cabin, underscoring the vehicle's premium quality and attention to detail.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption does not follow the instruction because it describes the appearance and features of the car’s interior and exterior rather than focusing on the subject’s motion, which in this case is the camera movement. The caption also uses subjective language such as “luxurious design,” “spacious seating area,” “elegant,” and “high-quality finish,” which should be avoided. The correct approach is to describe the camera’s motion in chronological order, such as: “The camera starts with a close-up of the car’s interior, then gradually moves backward to reveal more of the interior and both open doors, eventually pulling back to show the car from the outside.” All references to the car’s design, quality, or features that are not directly related to the camera’s movement should be removed.",
