    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a fast, blurry, high-angle shot of a motorcycle speeding down a road. The scene then cuts to a wide aerial view of two motorcyclists racing on a track in a desert. Both riders lean into a long curve as they speed along the track, with one maintaining a slight lead over the other.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **Two motorcyclists are seen racing on a track, with one rider positioned ahead of the other. Both are in a forward-leaning racing posture on their respective motorcycles.**",

  "generated_critique": "Feedback:\nThe caption is excellent and adheres to all the provided instructions.\n\n- **Accuracy:** The description is entirely accurate. It correctly identifies the subjects as motorcyclists, the setting as a road and then a desert track, and the specific actions of speeding and leaning into a curve. The relative positioning of the two riders is also noted correctly.\n- **Completeness:** The caption is comprehensive, describing the action in both distinct shots of the video. It starts with the initial blurry shot and transitions to the main aerial view, covering all the motion present in the clip.\n- **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    - **Chronological Order:** The caption correctly follows the sequence of events, describing the first shot and then the second.\n    - **Focus on Motion:** The description is centered on the subjects' motion (\"speeding down a road,\" \"racing on a track,\" \"lean into a long curve\").\n    - **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand, forming a coherent paragraph.\n    - **Objectivity:** It avoids subjective or emotional language and speculative statements.\n    - **Shot Transitions:** It correctly points out that the scene \"cuts\" from the first shot to the second.\n    - **Subject Interaction:** It effectively describes the interaction between the two racers by mentioning that one has a \"slight lead over the other.\"\n\nThe caption is a perfect example of how to follow the given guidelines.",
