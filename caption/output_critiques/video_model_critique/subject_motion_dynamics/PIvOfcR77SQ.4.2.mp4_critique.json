The description of the parked car and the snow on the roof is redundant information about the scene. The caption should be corrected and made more concise by focusing only on the camera's movement, which is the sole motion in this scenery shot. It should simply state that the camera pans to the right, shifting the view from a wooden house to a snow-covered path and forest.",
