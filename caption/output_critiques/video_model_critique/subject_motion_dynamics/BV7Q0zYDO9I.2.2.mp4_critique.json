    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the salient motions and dynamics of the primary subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary movements, or describe all subjects' collective motion if that is more appropriate.",

  "generated_critique": "Feedback on the caption:\n\nThe provided caption is excellent and adheres perfectly to all instructions.\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the setting as a \"dimly lit, wood-paneled room,\" the subjects as \"figures in orange outfits,\" and their static arrangement in rows with one figure at a lectern. Most importantly, it accurately states that the entire scene is motionless.\n*   **Completeness:** The description is complete for a static video. It provides enough context about the scene and subjects to understand what is being observed (or not observed, in the case of movement) without adding unnecessary detail.\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Focus on Motion:** It correctly follows the specific instruction for videos with no movement by stating, \"The scene remains static with no movement from any of the subjects.\"\n    *   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, clear, and direct. The description is presented as a single, coherent paragraph.\n    *   **Objectivity:** The caption avoids any subjective, emotional, or speculative language, sticking strictly to what is visible.\n    *   **Subject Description:** It describes the subjects' arrangement and static posture (\"stands motionless,\" \"stands still\") without going into excessive detail about their appearance, which is appropriate.\n\nThis caption is a model example of how to describe a video with no subject motion according to the given guidelines.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a high-angle view inside a large, wood-paneled room, dozens of mannequin-like figures in orange jumpsuits stand in organized rows on a dark, tiled floor. The figures, which have blank white heads, all face a single figure standing at a wooden lectern. The entire scene is static, with no movement from any of the subjects.",
