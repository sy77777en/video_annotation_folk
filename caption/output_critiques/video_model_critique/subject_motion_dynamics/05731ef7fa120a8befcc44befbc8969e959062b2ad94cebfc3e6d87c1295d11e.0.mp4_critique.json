    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a blank white background. Yellow ink appears from the left and right sides, moving towards the center. The two clusters of yellow ink continue to expand and merge as they approach each other. The ink forms a larger, more cohesive mass, with the yellow color becoming more prominent and the shapes more defined. The ink continues to spread and blend, creating a dense, vibrant cloud. The video concludes with the yellow ink fully merged, forming a large, intricate cloud-like shape against the white background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a dynamic display of vibrant yellow ink swirling and expanding in a fluid medium. The ink forms intricate, cloud-like patterns with soft, rounded edges, creating a sense of movement and transformation. The shapes continuously evolve, with the yellow hues varying in intensity, giving a rich, textured appearance. The overall effect is abstract, with the ink appearing to float and merge, creating a visually striking and fluid composition.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is excellent. Here is a detailed breakdown of the feedback.\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies that two streams of yellow ink appear from opposite sides and move toward the center. The description of them expanding, merging, and forming a single, dense cloud perfectly matches the visual events in the video.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete. It describes the entire sequence of events in chronological order, from the initial appearance of the ink to its final merged state, leaving out no significant part of the action.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption adheres perfectly to all instructions:\n*   **Chronological Order:** The actions are described sequentially: the ink appears, moves, expands, merges, and forms a final shape.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The description is centered on the motion of the ink, using strong action verbs like \"appears,\" \"moving,\" \"expand,\" \"merge,\" \"spread,\" and \"blend.\"\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The language is simple, clear, and informative without being overly wordy.\n*   **Objectivity:** It avoids subjective or emotional language. Words like \"prominent,\" \"defined,\" and \"intricate\" are used appropriately to describe the visual characteristics of the ink cloud rather than speculating or adding emotional tone.\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single, well-structured paragraph.\n\nThe caption is an exemplary model of how to describe this type of video according to the provided guidelines. No improvements are necessary.",
