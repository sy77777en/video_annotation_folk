    "pre_caption": "The video shows a close-up of several people's feet as they swing on a ride, with their shoes and the metal platform visible. The background is blurred, indicating a busy environment, possibly a fair or amusement park. The feet are seen moving in various positions, suggesting the ride is in motion.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the salient motions and dynamics of the primary subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary movements, or describe all subjects' collective motion if that is more appropriate.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good. Here is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is factually accurate. It correctly identifies the subjects (feet), the setting (a ride), and the visible objects (shoes, metal platform).\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is incomplete because it describes the motion in a very generic way (\"moving in various positions\"). It fails to capture the specific circular or swinging nature of the movement, which is the primary action in the video.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption fails to follow several key instructions:\n\n*   **Avoid Speculative Statements:** The caption uses speculative and interpretive language, such as \"possibly a fair or amusement park\" and \"suggesting the ride is in motion.\" The instructions explicitly forbid this (\"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears'\"). You should only describe what is visibly happening.\n*   **Describe Motion with Specificity:** The instruction asks to \"specify how they move rather than using generic descriptions.\" The phrase \"moving in various positions\" is too vague. A better description would be that the feet are dangling and swinging in a circular path.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** While the caption mentions motion, it also dedicates space to interpreting the blurred background (\"indicating a busy environment\"), which distracts from the primary focus on the subjects' movement.\n\nIn summary, the caption is weak because it relies on vague descriptions and forbidden speculation instead of providing a clear, direct, and specific account of the subjects' motion as required by the instructions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A low-angle, close-up shot captures the dangling feet of several people on a swing ride. Their feet, wearing different shoes like black wedge boots and sneakers, swing in a circular path just above a textured metal platform as they pass by the camera.",
