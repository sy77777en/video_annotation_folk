  "generated_critique": "The caption violates the instructions by including speculative language and excessive detail about the static scene. The instruction explicitly states to avoid speculative statements like \"it appears,\" but the caption includes the phrase \"in what appears to be a tropical resort.\" Furthermore, for a scenery shot with no moving subjects, the instruction asks for a brief note of one to three sentences. The caption provides a lengthy description of the static elements (\"a round glass-topped table, chairs, and lounge beds... a sandy area with a large tree and lush green foliage\"), which is unnecessary. The caption should be revised to remove the speculative phrase and the detailed description of the scenery, focusing only on noting that it is a static shot, as per the instructions.",
