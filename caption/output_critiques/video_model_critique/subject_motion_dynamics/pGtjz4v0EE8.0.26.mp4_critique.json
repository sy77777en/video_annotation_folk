  "generated_critique": "The caption focuses excessively on describing the static scenery (\"dynamic, wide-angle scenery shot,\" \"illuminated with golden lights,\" \"iconic landmark\") instead of prioritizing the subject's motion as instructed. It includes the subjective adjective \"dynamic\" and the speculative phrase \"due to a time-lapse or long-exposure effect,\" which presents an \"A or B\" option forbidden by the instructions. Furthermore, the caption completely omits the motion of the pedestrians walking on the sidewalk on the right side of the frame. The description should be revised to focus on the motion, describing how streaks of light from traffic move across the foreground, followed by the movement of pedestrians on the right.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "Long, flowing streaks of white and red light from traffic move rapidly from left to right across the foreground, passing in front of the Colosseum in Rome. On the right, pedestrians walk along the sidewalk away from the camera. The scene is captured from a low, wide angle at night, showing the ancient landmark illuminated with golden lights against a deep blue twilight sky.",
