A person in a red jacket is seen walking along the right side of the canal, moving from the right side of the frame towards the left. A bird is flying in the sky above the canal, moving from the center towards the top right of the frame.

The individual should be depicted as continuing to walk towards the bottom right corner of the frame until they exit the frame.\n\n2. The statement about the canal's surface being calm is incorrect.

The phrase \"appear to be\" also violates the rule against speculative language. Additionally, the description of the water's movement, \"is noticeably moving, as evidenced by the visible up-and-down motion of the boats,\" is wordy and can be stated more directly. The description should be revised to focus only on the movements of the person, the bird, and the water/boats in a more concise manner.",
