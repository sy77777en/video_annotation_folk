    "pre_caption": "The refrigerator door is open, revealing various items including a bowl of strawberries, several green glass bottles, and three clear glass food containers filled with chopped fruits and vegetables. A man approaches the refrigerator, reaching out with his right hand towards the containers. He grabs the stack of containers and lifts them out of the refrigerator. The man holds the containers in his hands, smiling slightly.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video, filmed from inside an open refrigerator, shows a man with short, light brown hair and a clean-shaven face, wearing a dark maroon short-sleeved polo shirt. He initially stands looking into the refrigerator, then reaches in with his right hand and takes out a stack of three clear, rectangular glass food containers with light blue-grey sealed lids. The top container holds a red, pureed substance; the middle container is filled with chopped red, orange, and pale yellow fruits or vegetables; and the bottom container contains green leafy vegetables and some white, stick-like vegetables. On the bottom shelf to the left, a large, light-colored bowl holds several red strawberries with green tops. In the refrigerator door on the right, two green glass bottles are partially visible, with a beige carton, likely a milk carton, to their left and a brown glass bottle to their right. The man smiles slightly as he lifts the containers.**",

  "generated_critique": "The first sentence, \"The refrigerator door is open, revealing various items including a bowl of strawberries, two green glass bottles, and three clear glass food containers filled with chopped fruits and vegetables,\" is overly descriptive of static objects. The instructions state to focus on the subject's motion, so this detailed inventory of the refrigerator's contents should be removed. The remainder of the caption accurately describes the man's actions in chronological order, but the description can be made more concise.",
