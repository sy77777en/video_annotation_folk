However, it includes the speculative phrase \"likely Paris\" and the subjective phrase \"capturing the vibrant energy of the city after dark,\" both of which should be removed to adhere to the instructions. The description should focus only on the observable visual information, such as the high-angle perspective of the city at night and the motion of the camera and traffic.",
