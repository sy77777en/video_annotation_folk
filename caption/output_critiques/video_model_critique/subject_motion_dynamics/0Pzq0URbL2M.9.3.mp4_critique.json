    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a dark, circular opening in the center of the frame, surrounded by a black background. As the camera moves closer, the circular opening becomes more defined, revealing two white figures at the edge of the well. The figures are seen leaning over the well, looking down into it. The camera continues to zoom in, providing a clearer view of the two individuals and the well's edge.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features two individuals, both wearing white shirts, viewed from above. They are leaning over what appears to be the edge of a well, looking downward. **",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good for the video. Here's a detailed breakdown of the feedback.\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is mostly accurate in describing the sequence of events. The camera does zoom in on a circular opening, revealing two figures. However, it incorrectly identifies the opening as a \"well.\" This is a speculative assumption, as it's impossible to confirm from the visual information provided. The instructions explicitly state to \"Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain\" and to \"Avoid speculative statements.\"\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption covers the primary action in the video, which is the camera zoom and the static posture of the two figures. It correctly notes their position and action of leaning over the opening.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption fails to adhere to several key instructions:\n*   **Avoid Speculation:** The repeated use of the word \"well\" is a direct violation of the rule against speculative language. A more appropriate and objective term would be \"dark circular opening\" or \"hole.\"\n*   **Focus on Subject Motion:** The caption focuses heavily on the camera's motion (\"the camera moves closer,\" \"The camera continues to zoom in\") rather than the subjects' actions. While the subjects are mostly static, the description should center on them. The camera's movement is the means of revealing the subjects, not the primary action to be described.\n*   **Conciseness:** The description of the camera movement is repetitive (\"moves closer,\" \"continues to zoom in\"). The information could be conveyed more efficiently in a single, streamlined sentence.\n\nIn summary, the caption is inaccurate due to its speculative language and does not follow the core instruction to focus on the subject's motion while avoiding descriptions of camera movement. It should be rewritten to be more objective and subject-focused.",
