    "pre_caption": "The video shows a head emerging from a hole in a blue carpet, surrounded by scattered wooden sticks and other small objects. The head remains relatively still, with slight movements, while the background includes a wooden chest of drawers and a sofa with a blue and white patterned blanket. The camera gradually zooms in on the head, providing a closer view of the scattered objects and the surrounding environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a human head with short, reddish-brown hair emerging through a blue carpet, occupying about one-third of the frame's height and positioned slightly left of center. The head has a light skin tone and a neutral expression. Scattered around the head are wooden sticks and various small objects on the carpet. In the top right corner, part of a sofa with a blue and white patterned blanket is visible, while in the top left corner, a portion of a wooden chest of drawers can be seen. The setting suggests a home environment with a playful or surreal element.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good for this video. Here's a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is inaccurate in stating that the \"head [is] emerging from a hole.\" The video begins with the head already positioned in the hole; the action of it emerging is not shown. This violates the instruction to \"Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain.\"\n*   The description of the head remaining \"relatively still\" is accurate.\n*   The description of the camera motion, \"gradually zooms in on the head,\" is accurate and correctly identifies the primary movement in the video.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption correctly identifies the main subject (the head) and the key motion (the camera zoom).\n*   However, it includes unnecessary details about the static background (\"a wooden chest of drawers and a sofa with a blue and white patterned blanket\"), which detracts from the primary focus on motion as instructed.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The caption fails to focus solely on motion by including an inaccurate action (\"emerging\") and describing static background elements in detail.\n*   **Chronological Order:** The chronological order is incorrect because it starts with an action (\"emerging\") that does not occur.\n*   **Avoid Speculation/Uncertainty:** The caption violates this rule by describing the unseen action of the head emerging.\n\nIn summary, the caption's primary flaw is describing an action that does not happen in the video. A better caption would remove the word \"emerging\" and focus only on the visible state of the subject and the camera's movement.",
