    "pre_caption": "The two men are standing on a balcony with ornate architectural details, including decorative columns and a balustrade. The man on the right, wearing a leather jacket and brown shirt, smiles and looks down, then looks up at the man on the left. He then takes out an item and hands it to the man on the left. The man on the left, wearing a denim jacket, takes the item and starts walking to the right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features two men engaged in a conversation on a balcony with ornate architectural details. The first man, on the left, has a buzz cut and is wearing a dark denim jacket, with only about half of his face visible. The second man, on the right, has short, curly hair and is dressed in a dark leather jacket over a brown shirt. They appear to be facing each other, with the second man smiling. The setting includes decorative columns and a balustrade, adding a classic touch to the scene. At the end of the video, both men start walking to the right.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains several inaccuracies and superfluous details. The opening sentence describes the setting, which should be omitted to focus on the subjects' motion as instructed. The statement that the man on the right \"converses with the man on the left, making natural hand gestures\" is incorrect; he is primarily listening and reacting, and his hand gestures are not a notable part of his action. The phrase \"He appears to hold an item in his hand\" is speculative and should be removed. The description of the man on the left's jacket as \"denim\" is an assumption about the material. The caption should be revised to accurately describe the sequence of actions: a man in a grey shirt speaks to a younger man in a black jacket, who looks down and then back up. The man in the grey shirt then turns and begins to walk to the right.",
