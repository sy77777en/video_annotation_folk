    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a view of a narrow canal flanked by buildings on both sides, with the camera moving forward along the canal. As the camera progresses, the buildings on the left and right sides of the canal become more detailed, showing a mix of orange, yellow, and beige facades. The camera continues to move forward, revealing more of the canal and the buildings, including some greenery along the left side. As the camera ascends, the rooftops of the buildings come into view, showing terracotta tiles and various architectural details. The camera continues to rise, providing a broader view of the canal and the densely packed buildings, with more rooftops and distant structures becoming visible.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is overly descriptive of the scenery rather than focusing on the camera's motion as instructed. It is also repetitive, describing the ascending motion twice. The description should be more concise and dynamic, focusing solely on the camera's path. The current caption describes the buildings' colors and details, which should be omitted. It should be revised to state that the camera moves forward at a low altitude along the canal and then ascends rapidly over the rooftops to reveal a wider cityscape.",
