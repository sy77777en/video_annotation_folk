    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the motion and dynamics of the main subject while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects' movements.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a man as the main subject, seated at a table in a restaurant. He has short dark hair and is wearing a beige short-sleeved shirt. He is engaged in an unusual action, using a portable electric fan attached to chopsticks to cool the noodles while eating with chopsticks. His expression is focused on the task. To his left, another man with short dark hair and glasses, wearing a yellow shirt, watches with a shocked expression. The setting is a busy dining area with decorative wall art. The main focus is on the man's unique method of eating, with the surrounding people providing context and reactions.**",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback on the caption is as follows:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is mostly accurate in its description of the scene and the main action. However, the phrasing \"before eating\" and \"continues to eat\" is slightly imprecise for the short clip. The man is in the middle of a single, continuous action of lifting the noodles to his mouth, not performing separate actions before and during eating.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is very complete. It successfully identifies the main subject, his unique action, the secondary subject's reaction, and the overall setting.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":** The caption uses the phrase \"watches in amazement,\" which is a subjective interpretation of the second man's emotional state. The instructions explicitly state to avoid such descriptions. A more neutral description like \"watches him\" would be more appropriate.\n*   **Description of Motion:** While the action is described, it could be more precise. Instead of breaking it into \"cool his noodles before eating\" and \"continues to eat,\" it would be better to describe the single, fluid motion shown: \"a man in a beige shirt lifts noodles to his mouth, using a blue portable fan attached to his chopsticks to cool them.\"\n*   **Chronological Order:** The instruction is not strictly applicable as there is only one continuous action, but the caption's phrasing incorrectly implies a sequence that isn't fully depicted.\n\nIn summary, the caption is good but could be improved by removing the subjective emotional description (\"in amazement\") and rephrasing the description of the main action to be more direct and accurate to the motion shown in the video.",
