  "generated_critique": "The caption violates the instruction to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\" by using the words \"stunning,\" \"vibrant,\" \"serene,\" and \"mesmerizing.\" The final sentence is also redundant, as it repeats information already implied or stated in the preceding sentences. To comply with the instructions, the caption should be rewritten to objectively describe the aurora's motion without subjective language or repetition.",
