  "generated_critique": "The caption does not fully meet the instruction requirements. While it mentions the camera gliding along the canal and notes the presence of various boats, it lacks a clear, chronological description of the main subject’s motion. The caption should specify that the camera, positioned on a moving boat, travels forward along the canal, passing by gondolas, water taxis, and other boats that move in different directions—some approaching, some moving away, and some crossing the canal. The caption should avoid general terms like “bustling” and “lively,” which are subjective, and instead focus on the observable motion of the boats and the camera. To improve, the caption should clearly describe the sequence of movement: the camera moves forward along the canal, passing stationary and moving boats, with some vessels overtaking or crossing paths, while others remain docked along the edges. Remove any subjective or redundant language and focus on the specific, visible actions of the boats and the camera.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video shows a daytime view of a canal in Venice, Italy, as the camera, positioned on a moving boat, travels forward along the waterway. It passes by gondolas, water taxis, and other boats, some of which approach, move away, or cross the canal. The camera captures the motion of vessels overtaking or crossing paths, while others remain docked along the canal's edges. The focus is on the observable movement of the boats and the camera's forward journey.",
