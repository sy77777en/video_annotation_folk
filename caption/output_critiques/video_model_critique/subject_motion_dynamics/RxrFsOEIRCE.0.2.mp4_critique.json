  "generated_critique": "The caption uses subjective adjectives such as \"scenic,\" \"vibrant,\" and \"fluffy,\" which should be avoided. Additionally, the final sentence focuses on static elements of the scenery (the forest and sky) rather than the camera's motion. The description should be revised to be more concise and centered on the movement. A more compliant caption would be: \"A first-person view from a camera flies low and fast over a green field, following two parallel dirt tracks up a gentle slope toward a line of trees under a blue sky.\"",
