It currently provides a static description of the scene rather than detailing the actions within it. The caption should be rewritten to describe the movement of the various boats on the river and to note that the tanks on the bridge are stationary. For example: \"Several boats travel along the river; a white tour boat and a speedboat move from right to left in the background, while an orange tour boat moves from left to right in the foreground. A convoy of military tanks remains stationary on the bridge above.\"",
