Additionally, the instructions specify that for videos with no movement, the caption should \"briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\" The current caption provides a detailed description of the scene's appearance, which is contrary to this instruction. The entire caption should be replaced with a concise statement that accurately reflects the static nature of the video, such as: \"This is a static aerial shot of a church, with no movement occurring in the video.\"",
