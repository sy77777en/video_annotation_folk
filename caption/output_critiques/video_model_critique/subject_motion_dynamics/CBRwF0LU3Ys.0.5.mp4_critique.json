    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a Porsche car with a distinctive split-color livery. The driver's side of the car is red, and the passenger's side is blue, with a white stripe running down the center of the hood and roof. On the red side of the hood, a large white circle contains the text \"+30°\" in red. Correspondingly, the blue side features a white circle with \"-30°\" in blue text. The word \"PORSCHE\" is written in white capital letters across the top of the windshield. A hashtag, \"#Drive2Extremes,\" is visible in white on the red side of the car. The vehicle's German license plate reads \"S·VG 1015E\". The car is shown from various angles, including a top-down view, a front view, and side views.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately describes the car's general motion but misses a key instruction. The video is a montage of several quick cuts showing the car from different angles, not one continuous action. The instructions state, \"When shot transitions occur, describe the motion of subjects in each segment separately, noting the type of transition.\" The current caption combines these separate shots into a single, generalized action. It should be revised to describe the sequence of shots chronologically, noting the cuts. For instance, it should first describe the car drifting from a high angle, then mention the cut to a front view of it speeding forward, and finally describe the cut to a side view of it drifting around a turn.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a high-angle, motion-blurred perspective, a red and blue Porsche drifts sideways across a snowy surface. The shot cuts to a head-on view of the car speeding down a snow-covered track, kicking up plumes of snow. Following a brief, blurry high-angle shot of the roof, the scene cuts to a side view of the car as it continues to drift around a turn, its wheels spinning and spraying snow.",
