    "pre_caption": "The dog, suspended horizontally in the air, is slowly rotated backward in a full circle. It begins in a belly-down position, turns completely upside down with its paws pointing toward the ceiling, and then continues the rotation to return to its original orientation. Throughout this movement, a person's hands are held near the dog's body but do not make contact with it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the motion and dynamics of the main subject while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects' movements.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The main subject of this low-quality, greenish-tinted video is a dark-colored dog with a long body, short hair, and tan markings on its underside. The dog, which wears a collar, remains completely still in the air while the camera performs a vertical circular motion around a central vertical pole. A person, of whom only light-skinned hands and forearms are visible, appears poised to hug the dog but does not touch or manipulate it.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains several factual inaccuracies and fails to describe the subject's primary motion. The statement that \"the camera cranes upward\" is incorrect; the camera remains in a static, low-angle position throughout the video. The claim that the \"dog's paws consistently point downward\" is also false, as the dog is flipped onto its back, causing its paws to point upward around the 00:02 mark. Additionally, the caption incorrectly states that the person's hands are \"without making contact,\" when they can be seen touching and guiding the dog's body. The description should be revised to accurately portray the dog's motion, which is a slow rotation in the air, guided by a person's hands, causing it to turn from its stomach onto its back.",

The dog begins on its stomach, is turned completely onto its back with its paws pointing toward the ceiling, and then continues the rotation to complete a full circle.",
