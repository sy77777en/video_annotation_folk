  "generated_critique": "The caption does not follow the instruction because it fails to describe the subject’s motion in the video. The video shows a camera smoothly panning to the left and then moving forward along the empty street, but the caption only describes the setting and static details. To improve, the caption should state that there are no moving subjects visible and briefly mention the camera’s movement, such as “The camera pans left and then moves forward along an empty street. No subjects are in motion.” All references to the appearance of the neighborhood, shops, table, and background should be removed, as these are not related to subject motion.",
