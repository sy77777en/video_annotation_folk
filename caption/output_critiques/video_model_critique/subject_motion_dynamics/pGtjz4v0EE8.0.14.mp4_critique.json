It states that people \"walk around,\" which is inaccurate as their movement is visibly accelerated. The description should be revised to convey the rapid, sped-up motion of the crowd and pigeons as they move across the square. Additionally, the first sentence describing the location is redundant and should be removed to focus entirely on the motion, as instructed.",
