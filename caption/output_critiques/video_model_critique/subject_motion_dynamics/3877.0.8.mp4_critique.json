    "pre_caption": "A hand, wearing a mustard-colored sleeve and a black wristwatch, is seen gripping the sleeve of an orange jacket, which is being held taut and extended downward. The background consists of a misty, mountainous landscape, creating a serene and slightly somber atmosphere. The hand remains steady, maintaining its grip on the jacket sleeve throughout the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video captures a close-up of an arm entering the frame from the top, holding an orange jacket sleeve that extends out of the frame at the bottom. The arm, clad in a mustard-colored long-sleeve garment and adorned with a black wristwatch, stands out against a backdrop of distant, hazy mountains. The focus is on the contrast between the bright orange fabric and the muted tones of the environment.**",

  "generated_critique": "The provided caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\n1.  **Inclusion of Subjective Language:** The caption violates the instruction to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\" by describing the atmosphere as \"serene and slightly somber.\"\n2.  **Focus on Appearance over Motion:** The instructions state to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" The caption dedicates significant space to describing static appearances (\"mustard-colored sleeve,\" \"black wristwatch,\" \"orange jacket\") instead of concisely stating the primary fact about motion.\n3.  **Handling of No-Movement Scenes:** For videos with no movement, the instruction is to \"briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\" The caption is overly descriptive of the static scene rather than being brief. It correctly identifies the lack of movement but buries this information at the end of a detailed visual description.\n\nA better caption would have simply and briefly stated that the hand holding the jacket remains completely still.",
