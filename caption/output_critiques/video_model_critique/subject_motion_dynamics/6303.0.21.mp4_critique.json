He gestures with his hands, crossing and uncrossing them as he speaks. The person in front of him holds a comb in the left hand and pink-handled scissors in the right hand, maintaining a steady position throughout the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a man with medium brown skin tone and curly black hair, wearing an orange textured outfit. He faces the camera, performing a rap while moving backward as the camera advances. In the foreground, a pair of hands is visible; the left hand holds a white comb, and the right hand holds pink-handled scissors. The man appears animated and expressive, engaging directly with the viewer.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is good.\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption accurately describes the scene, including the barbershop setting with its checkered floor and neon lights. It correctly identifies the man in the orange sweater as the main subject and accurately portrays his motion—moving backward while talking and gesturing with his hands. The description of the foreground hands holding a comb and scissors and remaining steady is also correct.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is complete for the short duration of the video. It captures the primary motion of the main subject and the static nature of the foreground elements, which provides a full picture of the action within the frame.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Motion-focused and Chronological:** The caption focuses on the subject's motion (moving backward, gesturing) and presents the simultaneous actions clearly.\n*   **Objective and Factual:** It uses objective language (\"orange sweater,\" \"checkered... floor\") and avoids speculation or emotional terms.\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand, forming a coherent paragraph.\n*   **Subject Interaction:** It correctly describes the interaction between the two subjects—one speaking and gesturing while the other holds barber tools.\n*   **Formatting:** The caption is a single paragraph without any extra formatting or introductory text, as requested.\n\nThe caption successfully fulfills all the requirements of the instructions, providing a clear, accurate, and well-structured description of the video's content.",
