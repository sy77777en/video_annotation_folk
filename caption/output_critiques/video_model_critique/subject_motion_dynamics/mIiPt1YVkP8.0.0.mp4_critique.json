According to the instructions for scenery shots, the description should be a brief note of one to three sentences. The current caption includes details about the appearance of the illuminated runways, the terminal, and the text overlay, which are not related to motion. The description should be revised to be more concise, focusing only on the fact that the animated scene is static and the only movement comes from the camera.",
