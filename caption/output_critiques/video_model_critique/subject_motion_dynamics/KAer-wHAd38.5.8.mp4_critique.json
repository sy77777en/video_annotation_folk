  "generated_critique": "The caption does not follow the instruction closely enough. It uses abstract and emotional language such as \"serene journey\" and \"peaceful and inviting atmosphere,\" which should be avoided. The caption also fails to clearly describe the subject’s motion in chronological order. Instead, it focuses on the setting and the immersive experience rather than specifying the actions of the main subject. To improve, the caption should state that the camera moves steadily forward along a sunlit street from a first-person perspective on a motorbike, passing by houses and greenery, while other motorbike riders travel in both directions along the road. The description should focus on the forward motion and the interactions with other riders, omitting subjective and atmospheric details.",
