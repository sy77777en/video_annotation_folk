    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features two women interacting. The woman positioned more to the left has long, dark, straight hair and wears a white and black checkered, collared shirt. On her right index finger, she has a silver-colored ring shaped like a treble clef, and on her left wrist, she wears a thin yellow bracelet. She is smiling and looking towards the right while eating a slice of pizza held in her right hand, and she also holds a small piece of food in her left hand. The second woman, positioned to the right, has long, dark hair and is dressed in a black and white striped shirt. She wears a small, silver-colored ring on her right thumb. This woman is smiling and looking towards the first woman, holding a small piece of food in her right hand.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is good. Here is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the actions of both women. The woman on the left does bring a pizza slice to her mouth, bite it, and chew. The woman on the right is smiling, looking at the first woman, and holding a small piece of food. All details mentioned are present in the video.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is complete for the short duration of the video. It captures the main action of the woman on the left (eating) and the reaction/concurrent action of the woman on the right (smiling and watching), as well as the interaction between them (looking at each other).\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Chronological Order:** The caption successfully presents the actions of the woman on the left in chronological order: \"brings a slice of pizza to her mouth, takes a bite, and chews.\"\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The description focuses on concrete actions and movements (\"brings,\" \"takes a bite,\" \"chews,\" \"smiles,\" \"looks back\") rather than static descriptions.\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand. The single paragraph is coherent and concise.\n*   **Objectivity:** The caption avoids emotional or subjective adjectives. \"Smiles\" is an observable facial action, not a subjective interpretation of emotion.\n*   **No Speculation:** It refrains from making assumptions, describing only what is clearly visible.\n*   **Subject Differentiation:** It effectively uses \"the woman on the left\" and \"the woman on the right\" to clearly distinguish between the two subjects.\n*   **Interaction:** The caption clearly describes the interaction between the subjects (\"looking toward the woman on the right,\" \"looks back at the first woman\") and their interaction with objects (\"brings a slice of pizza to her mouth,\" \"holding a small piece of food\").\n\nIn summary, the caption is excellent because it is a precise, objective, and well-structured description that fully adheres to all the provided guidelines.",
