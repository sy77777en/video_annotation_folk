    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A mixed gray-brown squirrel with a white underside and a large, bushy tail is shown on top of a rough, bark-covered wooden post. Initially, the squirrel sits upright with its front paws held together near its chest. It then leans forward, turns back, and begins to climb headfirst down the side of the post, gripping the bark with its claws as its tail rests on the top, surrounding the opposite side of the trunk.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is excellent.\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subject as a gray squirrel and precisely describes its sequence of actions: sitting upright with paws together, leaning forward, and then climbing headfirst down the post. The details about gripping the bark and the tail's position are also spot-on.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is complete, capturing all the key movements from the beginning to the end of the clip. It starts with the squirrel's initial static pose and follows through its transition into a downward climb.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Chronological Order:** The actions are presented in the correct chronological sequence.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The description focuses entirely on the squirrel's movements and posture changes.\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, clear, and direct, forming a concise and easy-to-understand paragraph.\n*   **Objectivity:** It avoids any subjective, emotional, or speculative language.\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single paragraph without any introductory text or markdown, as requested.\n*   **Interaction with Object:** It clearly describes how the squirrel interacts with the wooden post.\n\nThe caption successfully meets all the requirements of the instructions, providing a perfect description of the video.",
