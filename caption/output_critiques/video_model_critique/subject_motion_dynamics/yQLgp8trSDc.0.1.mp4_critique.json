    "pre_caption": "The man, dressed in a dark outfit, walks forward while looking ahead. He continues to move forward, passing by several other individuals who are dressed in light gray and yellow robes. The background appears to be an indoor setting with stone walls and some decorative elements. The man maintains a steady pace and his gaze remains fixed ahead as he progresses through the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the motion and dynamics of the main subject while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects' movements.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a man with a medium build and a mustache, who appears to be the main subject. He has a focused expression and is wearing a dark outfit, which might be perceived as black. His long black hair is neatly combed back. In the background, there are several men, some dressed in light gray robes and others in yellow robes with black trim. These secondary subjects are less prominent and appear to be observing the main subject, adding context to the scene. The main subject's posture and attire suggest a setting of significance or formality.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains a speculative phrase, \"or possibly at something located behind it,\" which violates the instruction to avoid speculative statements. Additionally, the description of the setting, \"with stone walls and decorative elements,\" is unnecessarily detailed and distracts from the primary focus on the subject's motion. The description should be revised to be more concise and strictly observational. A better version would be: \"The man in a dark outfit walks to the left while keeping his head turned to his right, maintaining a steady gaze toward the camera's position as he moves through the room.\"",
