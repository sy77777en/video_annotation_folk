    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a large, muscular humanoid figure on all fours, positioned on a grassy area in front of a stone building with arched windows and a clock tower. The figure starts to rise, shifting its weight and beginning to lift its body. As it continues to stand up, its arms and legs move in a coordinated manner, demonstrating its strength and muscular definition. The figure fully stands up, revealing its entire upper body and the details of its attire, which includes dark pants. The background remains consistent throughout, showing the stone building and a cloudy sky.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a large, muscular humanoid figure with green skin and dark hair. The figure is shirtless, showcasing a highly defined and muscular physique, and is wearing dark pants. In the video, the figure begins on all fours, displaying a focused and intense expression. Later, the figure stands upright, revealing a broad chest and powerful build. The setting suggests an outdoor environment, but the focus remains on the figure's imposing presence and physical attributes.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is inaccurate and contains information that violates the instructions. The figure is not \"on all fours\" but is in a crouched, three-point stance on a knee and its hands. The description of the motion is also flawed; the figure's fist is already clenched at the start, it does not clench it as it rises. The caption should be more specific about the motion, for instance, by stating that the figure pushes itself up from the ground. Furthermore, the caption includes several details that should be removed: the overly descriptive sentences about the background (\"stone building with arched windows,\" \"gothic architectural style\") and the subject's attire (\"dark pants,\" \"details of its attire\") are irrelevant to the motion. Finally, the abstract and subjective phrase \"demonstrating its strength and muscular definition\" violates the instruction to avoid such interpretations. The entire description should be rewritten to be a concise, chronological account of the subject's physical movement from a crouch to a standing position.",
