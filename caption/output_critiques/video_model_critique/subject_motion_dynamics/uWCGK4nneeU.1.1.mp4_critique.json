    "pre_caption": "A yellowish biplane with white wings enters the frame from the bottom, ascending along a curved trajectory. The plane continues to fly upward and to the right, gradually moving away from the camera. The background consists of a rocky terrain with a tall, white lighthouse standing prominently on the right side. The lighthouse has several windows and dark patches, possibly indicating wear or damage. A small, white building with a dark roof is situated at the base of the lighthouse. A dark, military-style vehicle is parked to the right of the small building.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **In the video, a yellowish biplane with white wings enters the frame from the bottom, ascending along a curved trajectory. It moves vertically upward while initially shifting left horizontally, then turns to fly right, gradually moving away from the camera, forming an upward curve across the scene. Positioned on the right side, atop a cluster of large, greyish-brown rocks, stands a tall, cylindrical white lighthouse. The lighthouse features several windows and some dark patches indicating wear or damage. A small, white building with a dark roof is situated at the base of the lighthouse. To the right of this small building, a dark, military-style vehicle is parked amongst the rocks.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly describes the plane's initial movement; the plane is already in the frame on the left and moves from left to right, not entering from the bottom or moving left first. The detailed description of the static background elements—the lighthouse, the small building, and the vehicle—is unnecessary and should be removed, as the instructions require focusing solely on the subject's motion. Additionally, the speculative phrase \"possibly indicating wear or damage\" violates the rule against making uncertain statements. The caption should be revised to accurately and concisely describe only the plane's motion.",
