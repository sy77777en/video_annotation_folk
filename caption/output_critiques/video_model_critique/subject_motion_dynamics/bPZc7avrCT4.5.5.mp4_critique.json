    "pre_caption": "Four men are outdoors. The leftmost man throws a red water balloon towards the rightmost man. Simultaneously, the man to his right throws a blue water balloon upwards, and the man in the middle throws an orange water balloon upwards. The rightmost man, holding a knife, swings it and pops the incoming red water balloon, causing water to spray. The blue and orange water balloons continue to ascend.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features four men outdoors. The leftmost man, with dark curly hair and a full dark beard, is wearing a light grey t-shirt and black shorts. He initially holds a red water balloon, which he throws. To his right, a man with short brown hair and glasses, dressed in a white t-shirt and dark shorts with a small logo, throws a blue water balloon. In the middle, a man with dark hair and a full dark beard, wearing a white t-shirt with a dark graphic print and dark green shorts, throws an orange water balloon into the air. On the far right, a man wearing a red baseball cap backward, a blue t-shirt with a graphic, and dark shorts, holds a knife with both hands and pops the red water balloon thrown by the leftmost man, causing water to spray.**",

The man in the middle throws both a purple and an orange water balloon upwards, not just an orange one. Consequently, the final sentence is incorrect; it is the purple and orange balloons that ascend, not the blue and orange ones.",
