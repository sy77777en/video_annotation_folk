    "pre_caption": "A man wearing a brown jacket, dark pants, and a brown hat with a black or dark brown hatband is walking down a tree-lined path. He is holding a small, reflective object in his right hand, which he appears to be looking at while walking. The background includes a bicycle parked on the left side of the path and greenery along the sides. The man continues to walk forward, maintaining his focus on the object in his hand.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a man walking down a tree-lined path. He is wearing a brown jacket, dark pants, and a brown hat with a black or dark brown hatband. He has a medium skin tone and is wearing sunglasses. The man is holding a small, reflective object in his hand. His posture is slightly hunched as he walks, and he seems focused on the object. The setting suggests a casual, outdoor environment.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:** The description of the events in the video is factually accurate.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption describes the main action from beginning to end.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The caption fails on this point. It dedicates significant space to describing the subject's static appearance (\"wearing a brown jacket, dark pants, and a brown hat...\") and the static background (\"a bicycle parked on the left side of the path and greenery along the sides\"). The instructions explicitly state to \"Focus on the subject's motion\" and not to describe appearance unless necessary to differentiate between subjects.\n*   **Conciseness:** Due to the inclusion of unnecessary details about clothing and background, the caption is not as concise as it could be.\n*   **Avoid Speculation:** The caption uses the phrase \"he appears to be looking at,\" which is a speculative statement that the instructions advise against.\n\nIn summary, the caption is overly descriptive of static elements (appearance, background) and uses speculative language, violating the core instructions to provide a concise, motion-focused description.",
