  "generated_critique": "The caption contains a factual error, stating that the camera \"slowly moves,\" when the video is a completely static shot. It also violates the instructions by using subjective adjectives such as \"beautiful,\" \"tranquil,\" and \"soft.\" For a scenery video with no subject motion, the instructions require a brief note stating this. The description should be revised to correct the error about camera movement and remove the subjective language, simply noting that it is a static scenic view.",
