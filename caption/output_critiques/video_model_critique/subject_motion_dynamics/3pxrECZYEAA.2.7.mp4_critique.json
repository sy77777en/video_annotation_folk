    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the main subjects in this video exhibit **atypical motion, posture, or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a cartoon-style scene set in a bar, viewed from an adjacent room. A man with light skin and short blonde hair is behind the bar counter, wearing a dark brown shirt. Initially resting his head on his hand, he later drinks from a cup. The bar is stocked with various bottles and cans, organized neatly on shelves. The walls are adorned with colorful posters, including a dartboard and a neon sign that reads \"Beer.\" The floor has a checkered pattern, and a potted plant is visible on the left side. The setting is vibrant, with a warm color palette dominated by reds and yellows, effectively juxtaposed with the darker, cooler colors outside. As the video progresses, the focus shifts inward, reducing the visibility of the exterior.**",

  "generated_critique": "Feedback on the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is accurate. It correctly describes the man's initial posture, his subsequent action of lifting his head to drink, and the camera's movement.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is complete, covering all the distinct movements that occur in the video in the correct sequence.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths:** The caption successfully presents the actions in chronological order, uses simple and objective language, and avoids speculation. It clearly describes the subject's interaction with an object (the cup).\n*   **Areas for Improvement:** The first sentence is dedicated entirely to describing the static setting (\"The scene is set in a bar...\"). The instructions state to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" While context is sometimes helpful, this level of detail on the background detracts from the primary focus on motion. The description of the camera zoom is acceptable as it is a significant visual event, but the main focus should always be the subject's actions.\n\nIn summary, the caption is accurate and complete but could be improved by removing the detailed description of the static background to better adhere to the instruction of focusing strictly on motion.",
