  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly describes the camera's motion instead of the subject's motion, and it includes detailed descriptions of the static scene, which the instructions advise against. The focus should be on the subject's movement. Since the subject, a house, is inanimate and does not move, the caption should briefly state that there is no movement in the video. The descriptions of the brick house, wooden door, archway, fence, bush, and lantern should be removed. The sentence \"The camera slowly moves to the right, revealing more of the house's facade and the fence\" should also be deleted as it describes camera movement, not subject movement. A correct caption would simply note the lack of motion.",
