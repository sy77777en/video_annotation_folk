The instructions state to focus on the motion of salient subjects. The caption should first describe the couple walking away from the camera along the path. It should then describe the camera's subsequent pan to the right, which reveals other people walking and an animal enclosure. Additionally, the caption includes the subjective adjective \"pleasant,\" which should be removed.",
