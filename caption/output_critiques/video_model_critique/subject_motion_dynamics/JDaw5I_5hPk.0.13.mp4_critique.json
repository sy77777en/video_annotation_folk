The introductory phrase \"This is a scenic shot of\" is also unnecessary. Additionally, the description of the birds' motion uses the passive phrase \"can be seen flying,\" which should be changed to a more direct, active description like \"flies.\" The caption should be revised to describe only the movement of the waves and the birds.",
