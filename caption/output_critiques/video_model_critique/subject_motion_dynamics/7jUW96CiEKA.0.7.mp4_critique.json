    "pre_caption": "The bird, with a yellow beak and gray body, is seen in shallow water, flapping its wings vigorously. It dips its head into the water, creating splashes as it moves. The bird continues to flap its wings and splash water around, appearing to be in a playful or bathing behavior. The background consists of a muddy, shallow water area with some scattered debris and a small rock or root visible on the left side.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a bird, likely an egret, standing in shallow water. The bird has a distinctive appearance with a gray body, black and white wings, and a predominantly yellow beak with a noticeable black tip at its pointed end. Its head is light gray, and it appears to be wading or moving slightly in the water. The bird's posture is upright, and it seems to be engaged in a natural behavior typical of its environment. The water around the bird is calm, with slight ripples indicating gentle movement.**",

  "generated_critique": "The provided caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the issues:\n\n*   **Unnecessary Appearance and Background Details:** The caption describes the bird's appearance (\"with a yellow beak and gray body\") and the background (\"muddy, shallow water area with some scattered debris and a small rock or root\"). The instructions explicitly state to focus on the subject's motion and not to mention appearance unless needed to differentiate between subjects. Since there is only one bird, these details are superfluous.\n*   **Speculative Language:** The caption uses the phrase \"appearing to be in a playful or bathing behavior.\" This is a speculative interpretation of the bird's intent, which violates the instruction to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\" and \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.'\"\n*   **Lack of Conciseness:** By including details about appearance, background, and behavior, the caption becomes less concise and deviates from the primary goal of describing motion.\n\nA better caption, following the instructions, would focus only on the bird's actions in chronological order, like this:\n\n\"A bird standing in shallow water vigorously flaps its wings, dips its head and body, and shakes, splashing water around itself.\"",
