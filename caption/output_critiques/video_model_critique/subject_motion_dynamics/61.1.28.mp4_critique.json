    "pre_caption": "The man, wearing a large hat and white sunglasses, is seen in a vibrant indoor environment with neon signs and festive decorations in the background. He begins to sway his body from side to side, moving rhythmically. The background includes a neon sign that reads 'Patis 2000' and various colorful lights and decorations, suggesting a lively and festive atmosphere. The man continues to sway, maintaining his position and expression throughout the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a man with dark skin and long dreadlocks, wearing a large, light-colored hat and oversized white sunglasses. He has a gray beard and is dressed in a green jacket over a patterned shirt. A silver chain necklace is visible around his neck. The man appears to be in a lively setting, with colorful lights and decorations around him. His expression is neutral, and he is facing the camera directly.**",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback on the caption is as follows:\n\n**Accuracy:** The description of the man's motion as swaying from side to side is accurate.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption completely describes the simple, continuous motion shown in the video.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption does not fully adhere to the provided instructions.\n- **Focus on Motion:** The caption dedicates a significant portion to describing the subject's appearance (\"wearing a large hat and white sunglasses\") and the background setting (\"vibrant indoor environment with neon signs,\" \"neon sign that reads 'Patis 2000'\"). This violates the instruction to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\"\n- **Subjective Language:** The caption uses subjective adjectives like \"vibrant\" and makes an interpretive statement (\"suggesting a lively and festive atmosphere\"), which goes against the rule to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\"\n\nIn summary, while the description of the action itself is correct, the caption is not concise and includes too much information about the subject's appearance and the scene, as well as subjective language, which deviates from the core requirements of the instructions.",
