The camera slowly pans to the left, revealing more of the street and additional houses. As the camera continues to move, a black car parked on the left side of the street comes into view, along with a small shop or building with a white sign and some plants outside. The street is lined with utility poles and wires, and the background shows more houses and buildings in the distance.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately describes the camera's motion but includes unnecessary details about the static scenery, such as the color of the house and the presence of utility poles and wires in the background. The instructions state to focus on motion and avoid describing appearance unless necessary for differentiation. The description of the scene revealed by the pan is also slightly too long. The caption should be revised to be more concise, focusing only on the camera's movement and the main static subjects it reveals, while omitting the descriptive details of the background elements.",
