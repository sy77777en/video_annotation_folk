  "generated_critique": "The caption is overly descriptive of the static elements in the scene and uses the subjective adjective \"scenic.\" The instruction for scenery shots is to \"briefly note this in one to three sentences.\" The current caption uses two sentences to describe the static landscape (\"scenic, static shot,\" \"hazy day,\" \"large, green-topped sea stack,\" \"turquoise ocean,\" \"modern house\") before describing the motion in a third sentence. This should be condensed into a more concise statement that integrates the environmental motion, such as describing how the ocean waves crash against the sea stack and cliffs while grass sways in the foreground.",
