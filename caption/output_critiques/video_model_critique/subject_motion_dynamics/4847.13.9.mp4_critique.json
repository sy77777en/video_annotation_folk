    "pre_caption": "The man in the top hat, initially leaning forward over a large map on a table, straightens his posture and turns his head and upper body slightly to his right to look at an older man. The older man, standing to the right of the table, faces the man in the top hat and gestures with his right hand, moving it up and down as if speaking. In the background, a man positioned behind the main subject remains relatively still, facing forward. Another man, further to the right at a counter and wearing a cap, also remains largely stationary, with his back mostly to the camera.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the motion and dynamics of the main subject while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects' movements.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The main subject is a man wearing a dark suit and a tall black top hat, who is initially leaning over a table, looking down at a large, light-colored map spread before him, and then stands up straight to look towards an older man. This older man, also in a dark suit and with light-colored hair, stands to the right of the table, facing the main subject and gesturing with his right hand as if speaking. In the background, two other men in dark suits are present; one is in the center, obscured by the main subject, and facing the camera, while another, wearing what appears to be a cap, stands at a counter further to the right, mostly facing away.**",

The description of the older man's gesture as \"towards something in the background\" is vague; it should specify that he gestures with his left hand toward the right side of the frame. Additionally, the sentence structure is slightly repetitive and could be made more concise. For example, \"The man in the top hat, initially leaning forward over a large map on a table, straightens his posture to look at an older man\" could be shortened to \"A man in a top hat, leaning over a map, straightens to look at an older man.\" Finally, describing the man in the top hat as turning his head to follow the gesture would be a more precise description of his motion than simply stating he \"looks towards the background.\"",
