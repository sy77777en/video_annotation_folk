    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a view of a narrow alleyway next to a building with a green metal door covered in posters and graffiti. The camera moves forward along the alley, revealing more of the building's facade and the low concrete wall on the left side. The person holding the camera raises it, positioning it to take a photo of the cityscape in the distance. The camera's screen shows the cityscape view as the person adjusts the angle slightly before taking the photo.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows a first-person perspective of someone standing in a narrow alleyway next to a building with a green metal door covered in posters and graffiti. A low concrete wall runs along the other side of the alley. Initially, the view looks down the alley towards a distant cityscape under a clear sky. Then, a pair of hands, belonging to a person wearing a black jacket, raises a black digital camera into the frame, aiming it towards the cityscape to take a picture. The camera's screen displays the cityscape view.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly states that the pan reveals \"more of the building's facade,\" when it actually reveals a view of a cityscape. It also speculatively concludes that the person is \"taking the photo,\" but the video ends before any picture is captured. The description should be corrected to state that the person adjusts the camera's angle as the video ends. Additionally, the caption omits the initial forward movement at the start of the video and begins with a static scene description instead of focusing on the subject's motion as instructed.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with a first-person perspective moving forward along a narrow, paved alleyway. On the right is a building with a green metal door covered in posters and graffiti, and on the left is a low concrete wall. As the camera moves, it pans left to reveal a view of a cityscape in the distance over the wall and some train tracks. A person's hands then lift a camera, framing the cityscape on the camera's screen. The video ends as they adjust the camera's angle.",
