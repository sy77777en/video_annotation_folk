    "pre_caption": "A pair of hands holds the two ends of a broken white cable. The thumb and index finger of one hand pinch and manipulate one of the frayed ends, pulling back the braided outer layer to expose the torn inner insulation and the copper wires at the core. The other hand holds its end of the cable relatively still as the first hand turns the damaged section for inspection.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A pair of neutral-skinned hands pinches one end of a white, braided cable with the index finger and thumb. The outer fabric sheath is frayed and pulled back from the break, revealing the inner white plastic insulation, which is also torn. The fingers manipulate the broken end, showing the internal copper wires at the core of the cable. The hands are positioned to display the damage up close.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly states that the left hand holds an \"entire bundle of charging cables\"; it holds one end of a single, coiled cable. The description \"the thumb and index finger of each hand pinch the other cut end\" is also inaccurate, as the hands are holding two separate ends of the same broken cable. The right hand's fingers are actively manipulating one end, while the left hand holds the other. The description should be corrected to state that a pair of hands holds the two broken ends of a single cable, and then describe how the right hand's fingers peel back the frayed outer sheath of one end to expose the inner components.",

The fingers of the right hand peel back the frayed outer sheath on one of the ends, exposing the damaged inner insulation and core wires.
