  "generated_critique": "The caption includes the subjective words \"tranquil\" and \"adding a warm touch,\" which should be removed to maintain an objective tone as required by the instructions. While the video is a scenery shot, the primary action is the camera's movement. The description should focus on this motion and the static elements revealed by it. The caption should be revised to describe the camera's pan across the snowy landscape and the buildings it reveals, without using emotional or interpretive language.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera pans from left to right across a snowy landscape under a cloudy, twilight sky. The pan begins on a car covered in snow and a small log cabin with string lights on its corner. It then moves across deep snow to reveal a red building with two white garage doors. The camera's movement concludes on a path leading towards another red wooden house, with small, illuminated evergreen trees placed nearby.",
