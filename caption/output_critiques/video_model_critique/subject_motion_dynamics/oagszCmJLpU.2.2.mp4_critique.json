The description also focuses on the camera's motion (\"pans from right to left\") rather than the subject's motion. The description of the subject's movement is limited to the word \"turbulent.\" To improve, the caption should omit the introductory phrase, subjective words, and the mention of the camera pan, and instead provide a more detailed description of the clouds' motion, such as how they churn and roll across the sky while being illuminated by lightning.",
