  "generated_critique": "The caption focuses on describing the scenery and location, which violates the instruction to focus on the subjects' motion and avoid repeating details likely found in subject descriptions. The use of subjective adjectives such as \"bustling,\" \"iconic,\" \"lively,\" and \"historic\" is also against the guidelines. The caption fails to describe the motion chronologically across the two separate shots or mention the hard cut that separates them. The description of the crowd's movement as \"milling about\" is too general. A better caption would describe the collective motion in the first shot, where people walk through the square and browse a souvenir stand, then note the hard cut to the second shot, where a larger crowd moves in various directions through the plaza.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a wide shot of a large plaza, a crowd of people walks in various directions. On the left, a few people browse a souvenir stand, while a man in a blue shirt walks past it. A hard cut then shows a wider view of the plaza, where a larger crowd moves through the space. Some people are gathered behind a railing on the left, while others walk towards and away from the camera in the center.",
