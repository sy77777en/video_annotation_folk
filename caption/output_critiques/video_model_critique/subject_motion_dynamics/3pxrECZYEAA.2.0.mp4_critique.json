    "pre_caption": "A green tadpole-like creature with a prominent yellow eye and a red pupil swims from right to left through a dark, abstract environment filled with tall, dark, plant-like shapes. The creature's body undulates smoothly as it moves, and it maintains a consistent pace throughout the sequence. The background remains dark and filled with the same abstract plant-like shapes, providing a stark contrast to the creature's bright colors.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the main subjects in this video exhibit **atypical motion, posture, or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a stylized, animated green tadpole-like creature with a smooth, elongated body and a prominent yellow eye with a red pupil. The creature is depicted weaving through dark, abstract plant-like shapes. Its body is sleek and streamlined, with a subtle gradient that adds depth. The yellow eye is striking against the green body, drawing attention to the creature's head. The tadpole's movement through the plants suggests a sense of fluidity and grace. The scene begins with the creature next to a red, egg-like circle before it swims away to the left. The overall scene is characterized by its bold colors and simple, graphic style.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good because it violates several key instructions.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown:\n\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The instructions state, \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions\" and \"Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects.\" The caption dedicates significant space to describing the creature's appearance (\"green tadpole-like creature with a prominent yellow eye and a red pupil\") and the background (\"dark, abstract environment filled with tall, dark, plant-like shapes\"). Since there is only one subject, these visual details are unnecessary and detract from the primary focus on motion.\n*   **Conciseness:** By including extensive descriptions of appearance and setting, the caption is longer and less concise than it should be. The core motion could be described in a much shorter sentence.\n*   **Descriptive Analysis:** The phrase \"providing a stark contrast to the creature's bright colors\" is an analytical observation rather than a direct description of movement, which should be avoided.\n\nWhile the description of the motion itself (\"swims from right to left,\" \"body undulates smoothly\") is accurate, the caption fails because it is cluttered with non-essential information that goes against the core guidelines.",
