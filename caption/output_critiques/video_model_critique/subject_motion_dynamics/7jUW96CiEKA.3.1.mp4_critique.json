    "pre_caption": "A hippopotamus is seen in a body of water, with only its head and part of its back visible above the surface. The hippo's head remains relatively stationary, with slight movements indicating it is either resting or slowly swimming. The background consists of a calm water surface with some vegetation visible in the distance, suggesting a natural habitat.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a hippopotamus partially submerged in water. The hippo's head is partially visible above the surface, displaying smooth, dark brown skin. Its eyes and ears are prominent, positioned high on the head, which is typical for a hippo, allowing it to remain mostly underwater while still observing its surroundings. The water around the hippo is calm, reflecting the animal's stillness and suggesting it is either resting or slowly moving through the water.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is inaccurate and does not adhere to the instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption incorrectly states that the \"hippo's head remains relatively stationary.\" The video clearly shows the hippopotamus actively swimming forward from left to right, creating a wake in the water. The motion is a steady forward progression, not a stationary state with slight movements.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is incomplete because it fails to describe the primary action of the subject, which is swimming through the water.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The caption fails to accurately describe the subject's motion, which is the core requirement.\n*   **Avoid Speculation:** The caption violates the instruction to avoid speculative statements by saying the hippo is \"either resting or slowly swimming.\" The motion is clearly swimming, not resting.\n*   **Clarity of Action:** The description \"remains relatively stationary, with slight movements\" is vague and incorrect, failing to describe the action with clarity as instructed.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A hippopotamus swims from left to right through a calm body of water, with only its head and the top of its back breaking the surface. It moves at a steady pace, creating a small wake behind it as it glides forward. The background consists of the murky water and a grassy bank along the far edge.",
