    "pre_caption": "The video shows a character moving through a dark, cave-like environment with glowing turquoise accents resembling vines or water streams. The character, which appears to be a small, light grey, circular figure with two white circular eyes, navigates through the scene by jumping and moving horizontally and vertically. The environment includes platforms and walls that are dark blue or black with a digital, grid-like texture, creating a maze-like structure. The character's movements are deliberate as it explores the space, occasionally jumping to reach higher platforms or navigate through narrow passages.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the main subjects in this video exhibit **atypical motion, posture, or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a pixelated, dark blue cave-like environment with glowing turquoise accents resembling vines or water streams. The main subject is a small, light grey, circular character with a simple design, featuring two white circular eyes, navigating through the scene. This character moves vertically and horizontally, interacting with the environment. The setting includes platforms and walls that are dark blue or black with a digital, grid-like texture, creating a maze-like structure. The overall aesthetic is reminiscent of retro video games, with a focus on exploration and movement within the confined space.**",

  "generated_critique": "The user-provided caption is not good. Here's a detailed breakdown of why it fails to meet the requirements:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is generally accurate in describing the game's aesthetic and the character's basic abilities. However, it is inaccurate in describing the specific events of the video, as it offers a general summary of movement possibilities rather than the actual sequence of actions performed.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is incomplete because it omits the specific, chronological sequence of the character's movements. It doesn't mention that the character starts at the bottom and performs a series of three distinct jumps to ascend to a higher ledge on the right.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Chronological Order:** The caption fails to describe the character's actions in chronological order. Instead of detailing the sequence of jumps, it gives a general overview of the character's movement capabilities.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The caption dedicates a significant portion of its text to describing the environment (\"dark, cave-like environment,\" \"glowing turquoise accents,\" \"digital, grid-like texture\") and the character's appearance (\"small, light grey, circular figure\"). This violates the instruction to focus on the subject's motion.\n*   **Specificity:** The description of motion is too generic (e.g., \"navigates through the scene by jumping,\" \"occasionally jumping\"). It does not describe the specific path the character takes.\n*   **Subjectivity and Speculation:** The caption uses subjective (\"deliberate\") and speculative (\"appears to be,\" \"resembling\") language, which the instructions explicitly forbid.\n*   **Conciseness:** Due to the inclusion of unnecessary details about the environment and appearance, the caption is not as concise as it could be.\n\nIn summary, the caption acts as a general description of the game's style and mechanics rather than a description of the specific action occurring in the video clip. It fails to follow the core instructions regarding chronological order, focus on motion, and specificity.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A small, white, circular character at the bottom of the screen performs a series of three jumps. First, it jumps up and right to a small platform. Second, it jumps straight up to another small platform. Third, it jumps up and to the right, landing on a wider ledge on the right side of the screen.",
