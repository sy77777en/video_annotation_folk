    "pre_caption": "The video shows a man with a light skin tone and short, dark hair, facing the camera with a wide, open-mouthed expression. The background is dark with small, bright lights visible, suggesting a nighttime setting. The man's expression remains consistent throughout the video, indicating he might be speaking or reacting to something.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a man with a light skin tone and short, dark hair. He is facing the camera with a wide, open-mouthed expression, suggesting he might be speaking or reacting to something. The lighting is dim, casting shadows on his face, and there are small, bright lights visible in the background, possibly indicating a nighttime setting. The man's facial features are partially obscured by the low light, but his expression remains the focal point throughout the video.**",

  "generated_critique": "The provided caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is inaccurate when it states the \"man's expression remains consistent throughout the video.\" While his facial expression doesn't change much, his head does move, turning slightly to his right and then back.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is incomplete as it entirely omits the description of the man's head movement, which is the primary motion in the video.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The caption violates the core instruction to focus on motion. Instead, it describes the subject's static appearance (\"light skin tone and short, dark hair\"), expression, and the background.\n*   **Avoid Speculation:** The caption includes the speculative phrase \"indicating he might be speaking or reacting to something,\" which is explicitly forbidden by the instructions.\n*   **Avoid Unnecessary Appearance Details:** The instructions state not to describe a subject's appearance unless needed to differentiate between multiple subjects. As there is only one person, these details are superfluous.",
