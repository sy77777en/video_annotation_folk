    "pre_caption": "The red character jumps from the ground and extends a limb to grapple onto a hook, joining the orange character. They swing together briefly before the red character releases and lands on a semi-circular platform. The red character then jumps across several more platforms, eventually reaching a high ledge. Meanwhile, the orange character moves to the right and climbs up a green vine attached to a large orange wall.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the main subjects in this video exhibit **atypical motion, posture, or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features two simple, cartoon-like creatures with atypical appearances. One is a red, bean-shaped character with two short legs and two black dot eyes. The second creature is orange and has a more rectangular, blob-like body with rounded corners, two legs, and round eyes with black dots. Also visible are several flowers, each with six pink petals, six red petals, a yellow center, and a green stem. The scene includes orange, semi-circular platforms, each with a black ring hanging from a small black post underneath.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains several factual inaccuracies regarding the characters' interactions and movements. The red character does not grab the first black ring; it grabs onto the yellow character's extended limb after the yellow character has already latched onto the ring. They swing together, but only the red character successfully grabs the second ring; the yellow character falls. The yellow character lands on a lower orange platform on the right, it does not \"jump to the ground and leap upward to the right.\" Additionally, the platforms are orange, not yellow. The description of the interaction between the two characters needs to be corrected to accurately reflect that the red character uses the yellow character to swing from the first hook.",

The red character then grabs onto the orange character's extended limb, and they swing together.

The red character then jumps across several more platforms, eventually reaching a high ledge.
