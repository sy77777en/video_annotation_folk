  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly focuses on describing the static scenery (overpass, building, trees, sky) and uses subjective language (\"dynamic view,\" \"vibrant atmosphere\"), which violates the instructions. The description of motion is also generic (\"moving vehicles\"). The caption should be rewritten to focus exclusively on the motion of the subjects. It should begin by describing the camera's pan to the left. Then, it should chronologically or simultaneously describe the specific movements of the vehicles, such as the blue car driving across the frame from right to left and the white van turning left at the intersection.",
