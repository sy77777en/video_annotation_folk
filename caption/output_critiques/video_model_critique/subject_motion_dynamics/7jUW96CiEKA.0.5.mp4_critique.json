    "pre_caption": "A crocodile is seen on a sandy riverbank, gradually moving its front legs into the water, creating small ripples. The crocodile's head and snout are partially submerged as it continues to push its legs further into the water. The second crocodile remains floating on the water's surface, with its body partially submerged and its head above the water. The background consists of a dry, sandy riverbank with some scattered vegetation.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features two crocodiles near a riverbank. The first crocodile is on a sandy riverbank, appearing to crawl toward the river, with its snout clearly visible. The second crocodile is floating on the water's surface, its swimming motion creating gentle ripples that spread across the water. Both the crocodiles have rough, textured skin with a mix of gray and green hues, and distinct dark bands along their tails. Their bodies are elongated and muscular, with visible scales.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good for this video.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:** The description of the events is accurate. One crocodile is indeed on the bank and slowly enters the water, while a second crocodile is already in the water and remains relatively still.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption covers the primary and secondary actions in the video.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption fails to adhere to several key instructions:\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The instruction states, \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions\" and to avoid describing static scenery. The final sentence, \"The background consists of a dry, sandy riverbank with some scattered vegetation,\" is a description of the static background and should be omitted.\n*   **Conciseness:** By including the unnecessary description of the background and being slightly wordy, the caption is not as concise as it could be. The description of the second crocodile could also be more succinct. For example, \"The second crocodile remains floating...\" is less direct than \"A second crocodile floats...\".\n*   **Clarity and Flow:** The caption separates the actions into multiple sentences, which can make it feel slightly disjointed. A more cohesive paragraph that flows chronologically would be better. For instance, the first two sentences describe the same crocodile's continuous action and could be combined.\n\nIn summary, the caption is factually correct but violates the core instruction to focus strictly on the subject's motion and maintain conciseness by including a description of the static background.",
