  "generated_critique": "The caption contains speculative language, such as \"what appears to be\" and \"that could be interpreted as either lights or windows,\" which violates the instruction to avoid speculative statements and ambiguous options. It also includes descriptive details about the hallway's appearance (\"sterile-looking,\" \"small, off-white tiles with a greenish tint\") that detract from the primary focus on motion. The caption should be revised to remove these speculative and descriptive elements, stating only the observed motion directly. For instance, describe the camera moving through \"murky water\" and past \"glowing, oval-shaped lights\" to create a more concise and factual account of the camera's movement.",
