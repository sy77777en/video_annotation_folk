    "pre_caption": "A red sports car with the number '42' on its side is drifting on a winding, dusty road in a desert-like environment. The car emits thick white smoke from its tires as it maneuvers through the curves, showcasing its agility and power. The camera transitions from the back to the front of the red car, revealing a gray car driving behind it, indicating a sense of competition.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a red sports car with a prominent number \"42\" on its side, drifting on a winding, dusty road. The car has a sleek design with a visible engine and a large rear spoiler. It emits thick white smoke from its tires, indicating high-speed movement and sharp turns. The car's glossy red paint and aerodynamic shape are highlighted as it maneuvers through the curves, showcasing its agility and power. The setting is flat terrain, enhancing the focus on the car's performance. As the camera transitions from the back to the front of the red car, a gray car can be seen driving behind it, adding an element of competition to the scene.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good for this video.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption incorrectly states the number on the car is '42' when it is clearly '41'.\n*   The description of the camera movement as transitioning \"from the back to the front\" is inaccurate. The video cuts from a high-angle trailing shot to a lower-angle side shot, and then to a wider high-angle shot.\n*   The second car is described as \"gray,\" but it appears to be white or silver.\n*   The second car is not just \"driving behind\"; it is also drifting and creating smoke.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption fails to describe the motion in chronological order as the shots change. It blends actions from different shots into a single narrative, which doesn't align with the visual sequence.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\" and \"Avoid abstract descriptions\":** The phrase \"showcasing its agility and power\" is a subjective interpretation of the car's performance, which is explicitly forbidden by the instructions.\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid speculative statements\":** The phrase \"indicating a sense of competition\" is a speculative assumption about the relationship between the two cars and is not a direct observation of motion.\n*   **Violation of \"Describe individual subject actions with clarity\":** The description of the second car's motion as \"driving behind it\" is an oversimplification and not a clear description of its action, which is drifting.\n*   **Violation of \"When shot transitions occur, describe the motion of subjects in each segment separately\":** The caption does not describe the motion segment by segment, instead creating a generalized summary that misrepresents the visual flow of the video.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a high-angle, trailing perspective, a red car drifts around a left-hand curve on a paved road in a hilly, arid environment. The shot then cuts to a closer, side view of the red car, which has the number '41' on its door and an exposed engine, as it continues to drift through the turn. In a final, wider high-angle shot, the red car drifts, creating a large cloud of white smoke from its tires, while a white car follows behind it, also drifting and emitting smoke.",
