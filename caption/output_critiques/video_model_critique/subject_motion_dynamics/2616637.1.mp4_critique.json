    "pre_caption": "A butterfly with black wings, white spots, and light blue markings is seen on a cluster of orange and red flowers, surrounded by green leaves. The butterfly flaps its wings while remaining on the flowers, occasionally adjusting its position. The background is filled with green foliage and more orange and red flowers, creating a lush, vibrant garden scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a butterfly with striking black wings adorned with white and light blue spots. It is perched on vibrant orange and red flowers, which are surrounded by lush green leaves. The butterfly repeatedly opens and closes its wings, showcasing its intricate pattern, and appears to be feeding or resting on the flowers. The scene highlights the contrast between the butterfly's dark, patterned wings and the bright, colorful flowers, creating a vivid and natural display.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good for this video.\n\n**Accuracy:** The description of the butterfly's motion is accurate. The butterfly does flap its wings while remaining on the flowers.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is incomplete. It misses a key part of the motion where the butterfly stops flapping, opens its wings fully to a flat position, and holds them there for a moment before resuming its flapping.\n\n**Adherence to the given instruction:**\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The caption fails to adhere to this core instruction. The first and last sentences are dedicated to describing the butterfly's appearance and the background scenery (\"A butterfly with black wings, white spots...\", \"The background is filled with green foliage...\"), which the instructions explicitly state to avoid in favor of describing motion.\n*   **Avoid Subjective Adjectives:** The caption violates this rule by using the subjective words \"lush, vibrant\" to describe the garden scene.\n*   **Conciseness:** By including descriptions of appearance and background, the caption is less concise than it could be.\n\nIn summary, while the caption correctly identifies the basic action, it fails to follow key instructions by focusing heavily on static visual details and using subjective language, while also missing a specific movement.",
