The caption also includes descriptions of the room's aesthetic and features, which should be removed to focus solely on the motion as per the instructions. The description should be revised to state that from a first-person viewpoint, the camera first pans left to view a window with a red light, and then pans back to the right, passing a heavy door and returning toward its initial position facing a holographic display.",
