The description should focus solely on the motion of the waves, such as \"Ocean waves repeatedly crash against the rocks and boulders along the shore, sending water splashing upward.\" The phrase \"creating a dynamic and lively scene\" is subjective and should be removed. The caption should be more concise and avoid redundant or non-motion-related details.",
