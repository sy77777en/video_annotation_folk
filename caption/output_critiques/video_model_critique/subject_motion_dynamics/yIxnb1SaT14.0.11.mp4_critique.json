  "generated_critique": "The caption contains a factual error and violates the core instruction to focus on motion. It incorrectly states, \"The camera slowly zooms in,\" when the video is a completely static shot with no camera movement. Furthermore, the caption provides a detailed description of the monument's appearance (\"ornate structure,\" \"two golden figures,\" \"quadriga of four greenish-blue horses,\" \"intricate carvings\"), which goes against the instruction to focus on motion and avoid descriptive details unless necessary. The caption should be corrected to state that the shot is static and that there is no movement from the subjects, removing the unnecessary visual descriptions.",
