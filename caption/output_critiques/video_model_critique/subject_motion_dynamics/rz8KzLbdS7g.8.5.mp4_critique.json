The video shows a camera moving smoothly down a residential street, passing by houses and gardens, but there are no visible human or animal subjects in motion. The caption should instead briefly note that there are no salient moving subjects and, if necessary, mention the camera movement. Remove all references to atmosphere, weather, and appearance, as these are not required by the instruction. A more appropriate caption would be: \"The camera moves slowly along a quiet residential street, passing by houses and gardens. No salient subjects are in motion.\"",
