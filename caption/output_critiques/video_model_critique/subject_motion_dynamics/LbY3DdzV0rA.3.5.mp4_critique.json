  "generated_critique": "The caption uses the subjective adjectives \"dramatic\" and \"powerful,\" which should be removed. It also includes the speculative phrase \"what appears to be,\" which is explicitly forbidden by the instructions. The description focuses more on the static scene that is illuminated rather than the motion of the lightning itself. The caption should be revised to describe the chronological action of the lightning flashing. It should state that the scene begins in darkness, is suddenly lit by a large flash of lightning, and then experiences several subsequent flashes before returning to darkness, all of which illuminates the storm clouds and a downpour over the canyon.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The scene begins in darkness, with stars visible in the night sky. A large, bright flash of lightning suddenly illuminates a vast canyon, revealing large storm clouds and a heavy downpour. Following this initial flash, several subsequent bolts of lightning strike within the clouds before the scene returns to darkness.",
