The video clearly shows a large, dark marine animal, likely a dolphin, swimming past the camera from right to left at the water's surface. The description should focus on this action. Additionally, the phrase \"what appears to be\" is speculative and should be avoided. The caption should be rewritten to describe the animal's movement as the central event.",
