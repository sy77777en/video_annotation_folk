    "pre_caption": "The four figures stand still, facing a wall illuminated by red light. A red spider emblem begins to form on the wall in front of them. The emblem becomes fully visible, glowing brightly. The red light and the emblem start to fade. The room becomes progressively darker until it is almost completely black. The figures remain in their positions as the room turns completely dark.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the motion and dynamics of the main subject while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects' movements.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows four figures standing from behind in a dark environment dominated by intense red lighting originating from the front. The main subject is a tall man positioned centrally, wearing a dark coat and facing away from the viewer. To his left stands a woman with short blonde hair, dressed in a white and dark suit featuring a distinct symbol on the back. To the right of the central man are two other figures, also facing away: one with voluminous long hair and another wearing a dark jacket with short dark hair. The jacket has a hood. All figures are silhouetted against the red light.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly describes the transition as the surroundings gradually turning dark. The video shows the figures descending, and then it hard cuts to a darker scene where only their red-lit silhouettes are visible against a black background. The term \"elevator\" is an assumption; a more neutral term like \"platform\" is more accurate. Additionally, the phrase \"becomes no longer visible\" is passive; describing the emblem's movement more actively would be better. The first two sentences could also be combined for conciseness.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "Four figures stand on a platform, facing a wall where a large, red spider emblem illuminates. As the emblem glows brightly, the platform begins to descend. The scene cuts to a darker, overhead view, showing the figures as red-lit silhouettes against a black background as they continue to lower into the darkness.",
