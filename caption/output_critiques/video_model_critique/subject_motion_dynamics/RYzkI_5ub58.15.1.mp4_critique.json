    "pre_caption": "In a vibrant underwater scene, various fish, including black and striped ones, swim around a colorful coral reef. The fish move gracefully among the corals, which include different shapes and colors, such as white, orange, and green. The background is a deep blue, indicating the depth of the water. The fish continue to swim around the corals, occasionally interacting with each other and the coral structures.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the salient motions and dynamics of the primary subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary movements, or describe all subjects' collective motion if that is more appropriate.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption should be revised to focus exclusively on the motion of the subjects as instructed, removing descriptions of the static environment like the coral's appearance and the water's color. The description of the fish's movement is too general; it should specify the distinct actions of the different fish. For instance, it fails to mention that the dark-colored fish remains mostly stationary near the center, while two prominent striped fish actively swim in the foreground—one moving from right to left and another entering from the bottom left. The term \"gracefully\" is a subjective adjective and should be omitted. The phrase \"occasionally interacting\" is vague and should be replaced with a more concrete description of the fish's movements relative to each other and the coral.",

In the foreground, a prominent black-and-white striped fish swims from right to left, while a second striped fish enters from the bottom left and moves upward. In the background, schools of smaller fish swim in multiple directions.",
