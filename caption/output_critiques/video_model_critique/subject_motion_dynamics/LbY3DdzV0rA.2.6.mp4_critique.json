  "generated_critique": "The caption includes subjective adjectives such as \"dramatic,\" \"turbulent,\" and \"fiery,\" which should be removed. The description of motion is too general. Instead of stating, \"The motion of the clouds and the light trails from passing cars are visible,\" the caption should describe the specific movements. It should detail how the dark clouds swirl and move across the sky and how the cars' movement creates streaks of white and red light traveling along the highway. The caption also dedicates too much space to describing the static scenery rather than focusing on the motion as instructed.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This time-lapse video captures a storm system moving over a highway at sunset. Dark clouds swirl and advance across the sky. Below them, the horizon glows with orange and red light, backlighting sheets of falling rain. On the highway, the headlights and taillights of passing vehicles create long streaks of white and red light, tracing their paths into the distance.",
