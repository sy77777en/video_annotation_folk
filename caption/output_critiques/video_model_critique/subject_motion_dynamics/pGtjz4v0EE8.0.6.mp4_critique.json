  "generated_critique": "The caption fails to describe the motion present in the video, which is a key instruction. Instead of describing the static appearance of the hall, the caption should describe the camera's movement. The video shows the camera slowly zooming in and tilting slightly upward as it moves forward through the center of the hall. The caption also violates the instructions by including speculative language (\"likely in a European palace or museum\") and subjective adjectives (\"grand,\" \"opulent,\" \"elegant,\" \"dramatic,\" \"beautifully,\" \"harmonious,\" \"majestic\"). The description of the perspective as \"level-angle\" is also inaccurate, as it is a low-angle shot.",

The polished, patterned marble floor reflects the room's features. The walls are lined with large paintings above dark wood paneling. At the far end of the hall stands an ornate marble altar with a central statue, and the view is capped by a coffered, frescoed, and gilded ceiling.",
