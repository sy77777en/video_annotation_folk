  "generated_critique": "The caption fails to describe the primary motion in the video, which is a key requirement of the instructions. It completely omits the movement of the two boats on the river. The description should be revised to include that a small boat moves quickly across the water, leaving a large wake, while a larger, double-decker boat moves more slowly in the same direction. The mention of the splash is accurate, but the movement of the boats is a central action that has been overlooked. The current caption focuses too heavily on static elements like the bridge and tanks instead of the subjects' motion.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From an aerial perspective on a sunny day, a small boat speeds across a city river, leaving a large wake, while a larger, double-decker boat follows more slowly. In the foreground, several military tanks are positioned on a drawbridge that spans the water. In the background, a large splash erupts near the riverbank, which is lined with modern buildings.",
