    "pre_caption": "A blue and white floral-patterned cylindrical nesting doll is seen lying on a white background. The doll starts rolling forward, revealing more of its intricate design, including orange and white details. As it continues to roll, the doll's patterns become more visible, showing a mix of blue, white, and orange colors. The doll rolls further, and its end becomes visible, showing a blue tip. The doll rolls out of the frame, leaving only the blue tip visible on the white background. The blue tip remains in the frame as the doll completely exits the view.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **switching from one to another**, so the description should first describe the first subject’s motion and dynamics, followed by the second’s.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video begins a cylindrical nesting doll, predominantly white with blue and green floral patterns.  Initially, the blue nesting doll is lying down and rolls out of the frame, revealing another nesting doll behind it that is also lying down and rolling on the surface. **",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good for this video.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is fundamentally inaccurate. It misinterprets the core action of the video. It states that the \"blue tip\" of the doll becomes visible and is left behind. In reality, as the larger, decorated nesting doll rolls, it opens, and a smaller, solid blue nesting doll rolls out from inside it. The caption completely misses the \"nesting\" aspect of the doll and describes the event incorrectly.\n\n**Completeness:** Due to the inaccuracy, the description is incomplete. It fails to mention the most significant motion and interaction: the larger doll releasing the smaller doll. This is the central point of the video, and its omission makes the description misleading.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is slightly repetitive. The sentences \"revealing more of its intricate design\" and \"the doll's patterns become more visible\" describe the same effect of the rolling motion and could be combined for better conciseness.\n*   **Clarity and Factual Description:** The instruction to \"clearly describe the subject's motion\" and \"specify the type of interaction\" was not followed. The interaction between the two parts of the nesting doll is the key motion, and it was described incorrectly, leading to a lack of clarity.\n\nIn summary, the caption fails because it inaccurately observes and describes the main event in the video, thereby providing a misleading account of the subject's motion.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A decorated, cylindrical nesting doll lies on its side against a white background. The doll rolls forward, and as it does, its two halves separate. A smaller, solid blue nesting doll emerges from inside and comes to a stop. The larger, patterned outer shell continues to roll until it is out of the frame, leaving the small blue doll alone on the white surface.",
