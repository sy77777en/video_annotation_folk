It completely omits the movement of several small boats on the water. The description of the sky, the spit of land, and the moored boats should be removed. The caption should be rewritten to describe the motion, noting that from a high-angle static view, a small boat moves from right to left across the water in the middle of the frame, while another boat moves in the distance.",
