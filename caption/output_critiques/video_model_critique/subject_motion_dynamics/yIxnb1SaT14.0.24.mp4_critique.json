  "generated_critique": "The caption contains a significant factual error and does not follow the instructions. It incorrectly states, \"The camera performs a slow, smooth zoom-in,\" when the video is a completely static shot with no camera or subject movement. The instructions specify describing the subject's motion or, if there is none, briefly mentioning that. Instead of following this, the caption invents camera motion and provides descriptive details about the scene's appearance (\"low-angle shot,\" \"grand, illuminated basilica,\" \"green patina\"), which is not the focus. The caption should be corrected to state that this is a static shot with no movement.",
