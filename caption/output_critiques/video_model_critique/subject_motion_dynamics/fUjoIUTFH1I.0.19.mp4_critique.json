The identification of the vehicles with flashing lights as \"police vehicles\" is an assumption, as there are no clear markings to confirm this; the caption should only describe the visible flashing lights. Additionally, the description of the location, weather (\"street scene, likely in the French Quarter of New Orleans, on an overcast day\"), and camera movement (\"The camera remains mostly steady, though there is slight shaking\") should be removed, as the instructions state to focus exclusively on the subject's motion. The paragraph should be revised to be a direct and concise description of the observed movements.",
