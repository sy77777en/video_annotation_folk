It only provides a static description of the scene and environment, rather than focusing on the actions and movement of the vehicles and pedestrians. To improve, the caption should specify that cars, buses, and vans move steadily along the street in both directions, while a pedestrian walks away from the camera on the sidewalk. Details about the sky, buildings, and hills should be omitted, as they are not related to subject motion.",
