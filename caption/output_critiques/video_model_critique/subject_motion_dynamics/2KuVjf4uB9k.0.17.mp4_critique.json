    "pre_caption": "The video shows a red sports car drifting along a winding road. It navigates a sharp curve, with white smoke billowing from its rear tires due to high-speed motion and tire friction. The car maintains a dynamic movement as it continues around the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a red sports car prominently drifting on a winding road. The car is sleek and low to the ground, with visible white smoke billowing from its rear tires, indicating high-speed motion and tire friction. It has a distinctive racing number \"GUMOUT 411\" on the side, enhancing its sporty appearance. The car is navigating a sharp curve, with its dynamic movement and the smoke trail emphasizing its speed and agility.**",

  "generated_critique": "Feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is not good because it violates several key instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is mostly accurate in its description of a red car drifting and creating smoke.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is incomplete. It fails to mention a distinct event that occurs during the drift: the car's trunk lid pops open. The instructions require actions to be presented in chronological order, and this is a key part of the sequence of events.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid abstract descriptions\":** The final sentence, \"The car maintains a dynamic movement as it continues around the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility,\" is a direct violation of this rule. The instructions explicitly provide \"emphasizing its speed and agility\" as an example of what to avoid. The phrase \"dynamic movement\" is also too generic and abstract.\n*   **Chronological Order:** By omitting the trunk popping open, the caption fails to provide a complete chronological account of the subject's motion.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** While the first part of the caption describes motion, the phrase \"due to high-speed motion and tire friction\" explains the physics behind the smoke rather than simply describing the visible action, which is slightly outside the scope of describing motion itself.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "An aerial view follows a red sports car as it drifts sideways around a sharp curve on a paved road in a desert landscape, kicking up a large cloud of white smoke from its rear tires. As the car slides through the turn, its trunk lid pops open. The car continues to drift along the curve with its trunk open and smoke billowing from the tires.",
