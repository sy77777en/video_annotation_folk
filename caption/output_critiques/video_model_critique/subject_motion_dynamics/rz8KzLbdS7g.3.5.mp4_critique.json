In the video, the camera moves smoothly forward down the residential street, approaching the intersection and mirror, but there are no visible moving subjects such as people, animals, or vehicles. The caption should instead briefly state that there are no moving subjects and, if desired, mention the camera’s forward motion. Suggested revision: \"The camera moves steadily forward along a quiet residential street. No other subjects are in motion.\" All other scenic and descriptive details should be omitted as they are not relevant to the required focus on subject motion.",
