    "pre_caption": "A group of people are playing basketball on an outdoor court with graffiti on the walls. A person in blue jeans and white sneakers runs past the basketball, which has a human face and appears to be talking. The basketball's facial expressions change, showing various emotions as the people continue to play in the background. The basketball's mouth opens and closes, indicating it is speaking or reacting to the game. The players continue their game, moving around the court, while the basketball remains in the foreground, still animated and expressive.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the motion and dynamics of the main subject while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects' movements.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a basketball court scene with a unique basketball as the main subject. The basketball, positioned prominently in the foreground, has a human face with expressive features, including eyes and a mouth, giving it a surreal appearance. In the background, several people are playing basketball. They are dressed in casual sportswear, with one person wearing a green jacket and white pants, and another in a blue top. The players are engaged in the game, adding dynamic movement to the scene. The court is surrounded by graffiti-covered walls, enhancing the urban setting. The focus remains on the animated basketball, which stands out due to its unusual and eye-catching design.**",

  "generated_critique": "The provided caption is a decent attempt but fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is generally accurate in describing the scene. However, it misidentifies the person running past by only mentioning their \"blue jeans and white sneakers,\" omitting the most prominent article of clothing, a yellow hoodie.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption covers the essential elements: the animated basketball in the foreground and the people playing in the background. It correctly notes the motion of the ball's face and the movement of the players.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":** The caption uses the phrases \"showing various emotions\" and \"still animated and expressive,\" which are subjective interpretations rather than objective descriptions of motion.\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid speculative statements\":** The caption includes \"appears to be talking\" and \"indicating it is speaking or reacting,\" which are explicitly forbidden speculative phrases. The instruction is to describe the motion itself (the mouth opens and closes) without interpreting the reason for it.\n*   **Lack of Conciseness:** The description is somewhat repetitive. For instance, it mentions the players continuing their game twice in separate sentences. The description of the ball's facial movements is also split across two sentences, which could be combined for better flow.\n*   **Chronological Order:** While the events are roughly in order, the structure could be clearer by establishing the static scene first (ball in foreground, players in background) and then describing the specific movements that occur.\n\nIn summary, the caption is too interpretive and subjective. It needs to be rewritten to be more objective, concise, and strictly focused on describing observable motion without speculation, as per the instructions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In the foreground of a red outdoor basketball court, a basketball with a human face rests on the ground. In the background, several people move around the court near a hoop and a graffiti-covered wall. A person wearing a yellow hoodie and blue jeans runs past the ball. As they pass, the basketball's eyes narrow, and its mouth transitions from an open-mouthed smile showing teeth to a closed position, then opens again. The other people continue to move in the background.",
