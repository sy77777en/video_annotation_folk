    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up of the tip of a rocket-propelled grenade launcher, showing its dark, metallic barrel and wooden grip. The camera slowly pans to the right, revealing more of the launcher's body, which is made of polished metal and wood. As the camera continues to move, the full length of the launcher becomes visible, including its handle and the attached rocket-propelled grenades. The grenades are green and conical, lying next to the launcher, and the camera captures their details, such as their pointed tips and cylindrical bodies. The background consists of a corrugated surface, likely a metal or plastic sheet, providing a stark contrast to the dark and bright colors of the launcher and grenades.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a rocket-propelled grenade launcher prominently displayed on a corrugated surface. The launcher has a distinct design with a wooden grip and a metallic body, showcasing a combination of dark and polished metal parts. The wooden section is reddish-brown, contrasting with the sleek, dark metal. The launcher is positioned horizontally, with its barrel extending towards the right. Adjacent to the launcher, there are two green, conical rocket-propelled grenades, each with a pointed tip and cylindrical body, lying parallel to the launcher. The grenades have a smooth, matte finish, and their color is a muted olive green. The overall composition highlights the launcher and grenades as the central subjects, emphasizing their detailed construction and arrangement.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good for the video.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n- The caption is inaccurate in several key details. It states the video begins with a close-up of the \"tip\" of the launcher, but it actually starts with the back end or stock.\n- It incorrectly claims the grenades are \"attached\" to the launcher. The video clearly shows the grenades lying separately next to the launcher.\n\n**Completeness:**\n- The caption describes the entire sequence of the camera pan, covering the revelation of the launcher and the adjacent grenades. In this sense, it is complete.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n- **Motion Description:** The primary motion in the video is the camera pan that reveals the static objects. The caption correctly identifies this as a \"slow pan to the right.\" However, it spends more time describing the static appearance of the objects than the motion of revelation itself.\n- **Chronological Order:** The description follows the chronological order of the camera's movement, which is good.\n- **Speculative Statements:** The caption violates the instruction to avoid speculative statements by saying the background is \"likely a metal or plastic sheet.\"\n- **Conciseness and Focus:** The description is overly detailed regarding the appearance of the objects (e.g., \"polished metal and wood,\" \"pointed tips and cylindrical bodies\"). The instructions ask to focus on motion and avoid excessive detail on appearance unless necessary for differentiation.\n- **Factual Errors:** The inaccuracies mentioned above (the \"tip\" and \"attached\" grenades) are significant failures to describe the content of the video correctly.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens on a close-up of the wooden stock of a rocket launcher resting on a green, corrugated surface. The camera pans to the right, moving along the body of the weapon to reveal its full length, as well as several separate rockets lying beside it.",
