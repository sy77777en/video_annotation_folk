As the camera moves forward, the blue house on the right gradually moves out of the frame, revealing more of the street and the houses ahead. The camera continues to move forward, showing a wooden house with a white roof and a garden in front, as well as a car parked under a carport on the right. The camera approaches the wooden house, providing a closer view of its facade and the surrounding greenery. The video ends with a close-up of the wooden house, highlighting its detailed structure and the well-maintained garden.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption does not follow the instruction because it focuses on describing the scenery and static features rather than the subject’s motion. The only motion in the video is the forward movement of the camera along the street, but the caption spends too much time detailing the appearance of buildings, fences, and gardens, which is not required. The caption should be revised to simply state that the camera moves forward along the street, passing by houses and fences, and approaches a wooden house with a white roof, as this is the only motion present. All other descriptive details about the appearance of the environment should be removed to comply with the instruction to focus on subject motion.",
