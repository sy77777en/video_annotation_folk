    "pre_caption": "A person's hand holds a metal whisk and moves it in a rapid, circular motion inside a clear glass bowl, stirring and combining the chopped green herbs, white powder, and clear liquid within.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A light-skinned person's hand holds a metal wire whisk, actively mixing ingredients within a large, clear glass bowl. The bowl contains a mixture of finely chopped green herbs, a white crystalline powder, and a clear liquid. The bowl is placed on a light-colored, wood-grain surface, surrounded to the left by several halved and squeezed lemons, a yellow lemon squeezer, and a measuring spoon with a metal handle and a red plastic bowl. A bunch of fresh green herbs is placed in a glass container nearby. To the right, there is a metal bowl containing green limes, a clear glass jar with a handwritten label reading \"SEA SALT\" filled with coarse white salt, and a small measuring spoon.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is good.\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subject (a person's hand), the object being used (a metal whisk), the action (moving in a rapid, circular motion), and the effect of the action (stirring and combining the ingredients). All the elements described—the glass bowl, chopped green herbs, white powder, and clear liquid—are present in the video.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is complete, capturing the essential motion and interaction within the scene. It provides enough detail to form a clear mental image of the action without being overly verbose. It specifies the type of motion (\"rapid, circular\") and its purpose (\"stirring and combining\"), which adds valuable context.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The caption centers on the movement of the hand and whisk, as instructed.\n*   **Chronological Order:** The action is continuous, and the description follows it logically.\n*   **Clarity and Simplicity:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand.\n*   **Objectivity:** It avoids subjective adjectives, emotional language, and speculation (e.g., it correctly identifies \"white powder\" and \"green herbs\" without guessing what they are).\n*   **Specificity:** It clearly describes the interaction between the subject (hand/whisk) and the objects (ingredients), fulfilling the requirement to specify the type of interaction and its effect.\n\nThe caption successfully follows all the provided guidelines, resulting in a clear, concise, and accurate description of the video's content.",
