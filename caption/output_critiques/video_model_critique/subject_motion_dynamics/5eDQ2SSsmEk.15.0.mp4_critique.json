    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up of a white cigarette pack with a red logo and the word 'RELAX' on it, placed on a dark, wet surface. The camera slowly moves downward, revealing more of the cigarette pack and the surrounding area. A hand, wet with water droplets, reaches into the frame and grasps the cigarette pack. The hand lifts the cigarette pack off the surface and moves it out of the frame. The final frame shows the empty dark, wet surface where the cigarette pack was previously placed.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **This close-up video focuses on a white pack of cigarettes featuring white text outlined in dark red, accompanied by a blue pattern. Prominently displayed on the pack is the word \"RELAX\" in a stylized font, along with the phrase \"ENJOY YOUR.\" The surface of the cigarette pack appears wet, covered in small droplets. Subsequently, a light-skinned human hand enters the frame from the lower right and grasps the pack, removing it from sight.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains several factual inaccuracies regarding the subject's motion and the sequence of events. The video does not begin with the box \"placed on a dark, wet surface\"; it begins with a hand already holding the box. The caption also incorrectly states that \"a hand... reaches into the frame and grasps the cigarette pack,\" when the hand is present from the start. Furthermore, the camera does not move; the hand holding the box is the only object in motion. The description should be corrected to state that a hand, already holding a small white and red box, pulls the box out of the frame.",
