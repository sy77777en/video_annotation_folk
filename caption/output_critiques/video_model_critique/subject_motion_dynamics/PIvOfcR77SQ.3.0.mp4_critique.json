The camera gradually zooms in on the sleds, which are green, yellow, red, and blue, and are positioned next to a wooden post and a lantern. As the camera continues to zoom in, a snowplow starts to appear from the right side of the frame, moving towards the house. The snowplow becomes more visible, clearing the snow in front of the house.",

Additionally, the description of the static scene, the sleds' colors, the lantern, and the camera zoom should be removed to adhere to the instruction to focus only on the subject's motion. The description should be revised to first mention the falling snow and then accurately describe the snowplow's movement.",
