It also contains subjective adjectives such as \"iconic,\" \"vibrant,\" and \"dynamic,\" which are prohibited. The description should be revised to describe only the movement of the traffic. For example, the caption could state: \"In a time-lapse sequence, streaks of red and white light from vehicle traffic flow continuously along the road toward and around the stationary Arc de Triomphe.\"",
