    "pre_caption": "In a serene natural setting, a group of elephants is seen near a riverbank. The background is filled with lush greenery and trees, creating a tranquil atmosphere. One elephant is closer to the river, while another is further up the bank, and a third is partially hidden among the bushes. The river flows gently, reflecting the light of the setting sun. The elephants appear to be stationary, with minimal movement, as they stand and graze near the water's edge.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good because it violates several key instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption's description of the elephants' locations is imprecise and potentially inaccurate. It mentions three elephants in specific locations, but there appear to be at least four visible. It also states the elephants are grazing, which is an assumption not clearly supported by the video; they are simply standing still.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption captures the overall scene but fails to accurately account for all visible subjects.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violation:** The caption uses emotional and subjective adjectives like \"serene\" and \"tranquil,\" which are explicitly forbidden.\n*   **Violation:** It includes the speculative phrase \"appear to be,\" which is against the instructions.\n*   **Violation:** The description is not focused on motion. While it correctly notes the subjects are stationary, this information is secondary to a lengthy description of the scenery (\"lush greenery,\" \"tranquil atmosphere,\" \"river flows gently\"). The instructions require the primary focus to be on the subject's motion (or lack thereof).\n*   **Violation:** It describes an action (\"graze\") that is not visible or certain.\n\nIn summary, the caption fails by including subjective language, speculation, and unverified actions, while also not maintaining the required focus on the subjects' movement. A better caption would be more direct and factual, focusing only on the observable state of the elephants.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a wide shot of a river landscape at dusk, four elephants are stationary. One elephant stands in a shallow stream in the lower left. Two more stand on a sandbank to the right. A fourth elephant is partially visible on the grassy bank further up on the left.",
