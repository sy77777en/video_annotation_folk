The description should focus solely on the visible motion of the river, such as “The river flows steadily over rocks, creating gentle ripples and small waves as the water moves downstream.” Remove references to the greenery, mountains, sky, and the overall atmosphere, as these do not pertain to the subject’s motion.",
