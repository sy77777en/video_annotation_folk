This would better align with the instruction to focus on movement. For instance, rephrasing it to \"In a high-angle aerial shot, the camera moves slowly forward and downward over the French Quarter in New Orleans, approaching the St. Louis Cathedral and Jackson Square on a foggy day\" would make the description more direct and motion-centric, while also removing the slightly redundant phrase \"capturing the scene.\"",
