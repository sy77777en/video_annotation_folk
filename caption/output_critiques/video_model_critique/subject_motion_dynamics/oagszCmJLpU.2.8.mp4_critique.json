  "generated_critique": "The caption generally follows the instruction by describing the motion of the storm clouds in chronological order, noting the formation, churning, swirling, and movement across the horizon, as well as the visible rain. However, the phrase \"dramatic, dark clouds\" uses an emotional adjective (\"dramatic\"), which should be avoided. The caption could be improved by specifying the sequence of motion more clearly, such as: \"The clouds gradually build and thicken, then begin to rotate and swirl as the storm intensifies, with rain falling in the distance while the entire system moves steadily across the horizon.\" Remove subjective language and ensure the description is strictly focused on observable motion.",
