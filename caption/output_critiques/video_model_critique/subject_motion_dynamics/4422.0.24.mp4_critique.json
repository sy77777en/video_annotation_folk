    "pre_caption": "A man energetically plays a drum set, raising his right arm high and bringing a drumstick down onto a cymbal. He then moves his head and upper body from side to side and forward, striking the cymbals with both drumsticks. He shouts and leans forward, continuing to play, then turns his head to the right and back to the front while still drumming.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A man with short, messy brown hair is energetically playing a drum set. He is wearing a light blue blazer over a white hoodie; the hoodie has the word \"HELLBOY\" printed in red letters within a red outlined box on the chest. He is shown shouting with an intense expression as he plays with drumsticks. Parts of the drum set are visible, including golden-bronze colored cymbals; one larger cymbal has \"PAISTE\" written on it in black lettering.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately describes the drummer's movements but uses several subjective adjectives, which the instructions advise against. Words like \"remarkable energy,\" \"powerful,\" \"vigorous,\" and \"intensity\" should be replaced with more objective, descriptive terms that still convey the quality of the motion. For instance, instead of \"plays the drums with remarkable energy,\" the caption could state that he \"plays the drums, moving rapidly.\" Similarly, \"powerful strikes\" could be rephrased as \"strikes the cymbals with force.\" The description of the body movements, such as leaning forward and turning his head, is accurate and should be retained.",
