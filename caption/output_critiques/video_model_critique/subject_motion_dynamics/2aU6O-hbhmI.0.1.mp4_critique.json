The instructions state that for scenery shots without salient subjects, the description should be brief. The current caption is repetitive, describing the camera's pan twice (\"As the camera pans left...\" and \"The camera continues to pan left...\"). It also includes excessive detail about static elements like the specific location of the construction site and the color of the sky. The description should be condensed to a single sentence that describes the camera's motion across the static scene.",
