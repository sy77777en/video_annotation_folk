    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a view of a cityscape featuring a prominent bridge with a metal framework, surrounded by tall buildings and power lines. As the camera moves forward, the bridge becomes more prominent, and the details of its structure, including its support beams and towers, are clearly visible. The camera continues to move closer, revealing more of the bridge's intricate design and the vehicles traveling on it. The background includes a river below the bridge and a mix of modern and older buildings. The camera finally focuses on the bridge's central tower and the power lines running parallel to it, providing a detailed view of the bridge's architecture and the surrounding urban environment.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption does not follow the instruction because it focuses on describing the cityscape, bridge architecture, and surrounding environment rather than the motion of the subjects in the video. The main subject motion is the camera itself, which moves steadily forward toward the bridge, and the vehicles traveling across the bridge. The caption should be revised to describe the camera’s forward movement and the motion of the vehicles in chronological order, while omitting static details about the bridge’s design and the cityscape that are not related to subject motion. Remove references to the architecture and environment unless needed to clarify subject movement.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with the camera moving steadily forward toward a prominent bridge, capturing the motion of vehicles traveling across it. As the camera advances, the bridge becomes more prominent, and the focus shifts to the vehicles moving along its span. The camera continues its forward movement, drawing closer to the bridge's central tower, while the vehicles maintain their steady flow. The video concludes with the camera focusing on the bridge's central tower and the power lines running parallel to it, emphasizing the dynamic movement of both the camera and the vehicles.",
