    "pre_caption": "The player's perspective moves forward along a dirt road lined with trees and buildings, with the military vehicle becoming more central in the view as the player advances. The vehicle's target indicators and decreasing numbers continue to highlight it as the primary objective. The player approaches the vehicle, passing by the parked sedans and debris scattered on the road. The vehicle's target indicators and decreasing numbers remain visible, emphasizing its importance as the player gets closer. The player finally reaches the vehicle, with the target indicators and decreasing numbers clearly visible, indicating the vehicle's status as the main target.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video displays a first-person perspective from a video game. A dark, angular military vehicle, possibly an armored truck with a mounted weapon system, is prominent in the midground, moving along a dirt road. This vehicle is marked with orange and blue digital icons, including numbers that decrease (e.g., \"30\", \"23\", \"16\") and the word \"ATTACK,\" indicating it as a target. To the right of the road, two stationary white, four-door sedans are parked. The sedan closer to the viewer is facing right, while the one farther away is facing left. In the foreground, elements of a game interface are visible: a minimap in the bottom left corner displays a blue arrow and other icons, with green subtitles positioned next to the blue map; health and ammunition indicators in the bottom right show \"100%\" and \"101/101\" in a blue digital font; and additional orange diamond-shaped objective markers with numbers like \"103\" and \"86\" are superimposed on structures in the distance. A partial view of another vehicle, with a white body and blue from floating game icons, is seen in the bottom right foreground.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is overly long and contains redundant information that interprets game mechanics rather than describing motion, which violates the instructions. The repeated descriptions of the \"target indicators and decreasing numbers\" and their meaning (e.g., \"highlight it as the primary objective,\" \"emphasizing the vehicle's importance,\" \"indicating the vehicle's status as the main target\") should be removed. The description should focus only on the physical movement of the player's perspective and the vehicle's spinning part. The core description of the player's movement—advancing, dropping down to the street, and running toward the vehicle with the spinning object—is accurate and should be retained, but the repetitive and interpretive sentences should be deleted to make the caption concise and compliant.",
