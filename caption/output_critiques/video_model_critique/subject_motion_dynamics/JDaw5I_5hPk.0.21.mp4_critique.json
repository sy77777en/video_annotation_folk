The instructions require a description of the subject's motion. The caption should be revised to describe the water in the stream flowing over the rocks. Additionally, the final sentence, \"The overall scene is peaceful and natural,\" should be removed because it uses the subjective adjective \"peaceful,\" which is forbidden by the instructions.",
