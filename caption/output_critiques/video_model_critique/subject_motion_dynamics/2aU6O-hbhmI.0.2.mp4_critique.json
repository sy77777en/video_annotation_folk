    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a view of a construction site at sunset, featuring a large crane in the center, surrounded by partially built structures and high-rise buildings. The camera gradually moves forward, providing a closer look at the crane and the construction materials scattered around the site. The sky transitions from a bright blue to a warm orange as the sun sets, casting a golden glow over the scene. The camera continues to move forward, focusing on the crane and the buildings in the background, which include a tall glass building and other high-rise structures. The video concludes with a closer view of the crane and the surrounding buildings, highlighting the ongoing construction work against the backdrop of the setting sun.",

  "generated_critique": "Feedback:\nThe caption is not a good fit for the video because it violates the core instructions for describing a scene with no subject motion.\n\n- **Adherence to Instructions:** The instructions state, \"If the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail\" and \"If the video is a scenery shot without salient subjects, you do not need to describe subject motion. Instead, briefly note this in one to three sentences.\" This video is a scenery shot where the main subject, the crane, is static. The caption, however, is a lengthy, detailed paragraph describing the scene, the changing sky, and the camera's movement, which directly contradicts the guideline for brevity in such cases.\n\n- **Accuracy of Motion Description:** The caption inaccurately describes the camera's movement as \"mov[ing] forward.\" The camera is actually performing a slow upward pan or tilt, not moving horizontally through the space.\n\n- **Focus:** The caption focuses extensively on describing the static scenery (buildings, sunset, construction materials) rather than simply stating that the subjects are not moving, which is the primary requirement for this type of video.\n\nIn summary, the caption is overly descriptive for a static scene and mischaracterizes the camera's motion, failing to adhere to the specific instructions provided for videos without moving subjects.",
