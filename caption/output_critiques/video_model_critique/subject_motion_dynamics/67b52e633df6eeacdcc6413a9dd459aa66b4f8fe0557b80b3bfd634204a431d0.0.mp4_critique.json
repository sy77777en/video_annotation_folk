    "pre_caption": "The camera starts close to the two women and gradually moves to the right, capturing their relaxed postures on the lounge chairs. The woman in the green bikini adjusts her position slightly, while the woman in the yellow swimsuit remains mostly still, occasionally shifting her legs. The background includes a sandy beach, some greenery, and a few boats and umbrellas, indicating a beachside location.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features two women relaxing on wooden lounge chairs at a beach setting. The woman on the left has light skin and long blonde hair, wearing a green bikini and sunglasses. She is reclining comfortably. The woman on the right also has light skin and medium-length brown hair, wearing a yellow swimsuit and sunglasses. She is seated with her legs bent, appearing relaxed. Both women are facing each other, suggesting they might be engaged in conversation. The setting is sunny, with beach umbrellas and other lounge chairs nearby.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:** The description of the scene and the general actions is accurate. The camera does move to the right, and the women are in relaxed postures on a beach.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is incomplete. It describes the subjects' movements in very general terms (\"adjusts her position slightly,\" \"remains mostly still\"). It misses more specific actions, such as the woman in the green bikini touching the tattoo on her thigh and later gesturing with her hand as if in conversation.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption fails to follow several key instructions:\n*   **Focus on subject's motion:** The caption dedicates significant space to describing the camera's movement (\"The camera starts close... and gradually moves to the right\") and the background scenery (\"The background includes a sandy beach...\"). The instructions explicitly state to \"Focus on the subject's motion\" and avoid describing details not related to their movement.\n*   **Specificity of action:** The instruction asks to \"Describe individual subject actions with clarity.\" The caption uses vague phrases like \"adjusts her position slightly\" instead of describing the specific movements, such as touching her leg or gesturing.\n\nIn summary, the caption is more of a general scene description than a focused account of the subjects' motion. It violates the core instruction by prioritizing camera movement and background details over the specific actions of the people in the video.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "Two women relax on lounge chairs on a sandy beach. The woman on the left, wearing a green bikini, lies back and runs her hand over a tattoo on her left thigh. The woman on the right, wearing a yellow one-piece swimsuit, sits up slightly with her hands in her lap. Towards the end of the clip, the woman in the green bikini lifts her right hand and gestures as if she is talking.",
