    "pre_caption": "The man, dressed in a red sweater and wearing a necklace, is in a room with a checkered floor and various neon lights and equipment in the background. He begins by standing with his left hand on his abdomen and his right arm extended. He then starts to raise his right arm, forming a fist. The man continues to lift his right arm higher, maintaining his fist, while his left hand remains on his abdomen. The background includes a neon sign and various electronic equipment, suggesting a lively and possibly musical environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a man with medium skin tone and an afro hairstyle, wearing a bright red, long-sleeved shirt. He is expressive, with his mouth open wide, possibly singing or shouting. In one instance, he raises his right arm with a clenched fist, while his left hand rests on his abdomen. The setting appears to be a room with a checkered floor and vibrant lighting, contributing to a dynamic atmosphere.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good because it fails to accurately describe the visible motion and violates several key instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:** The description of the man's arm movement is inaccurate. The video does not clearly show him with an \"extended\" right arm, nor does it clearly show him forming a fist and raising his arm. These details are speculative and not supported by the visual evidence in the short, blurry clip. Furthermore, the phrase \"suggesting a lively and possibly musical environment\" is a speculative statement, which is explicitly forbidden by the instructions.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption completely omits the most prominent action. The man's mouth is wide open, and his expression clearly indicates he is singing or shouting emphatically. This is the central motion/action of the subject, and it is not mentioned at all.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The caption spends too much time describing the man's static appearance (\"red sweater,\" \"necklace\") and the background, rather than focusing on his movement.\n*   **Avoid Speculation:** The caption describes arm movements that are not clearly visible and uses speculative language (\"suggesting,\" \"possibly\"), both of which are against the rules.\n*   **Describe Visible Action:** It fails to describe the most obvious visible action (singing/shouting) while inventing actions that are not clearly seen.\n\nIn summary, the caption is inaccurate, incomplete, and does not follow the provided guidelines, making it a poor description of the video.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a room with green textured walls and a black-and-white checkered floor, a man with an afro, wearing a red sweater, shouts or sings with an intense expression and his mouth wide open. The camera swirls around him with a distorted, fisheye-like effect, blurring the background as he moves his body energetically.",
