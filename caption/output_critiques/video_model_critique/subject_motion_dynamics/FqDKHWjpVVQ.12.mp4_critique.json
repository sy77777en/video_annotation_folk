    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video showcases a first-person shooter game scene. The main subject is a player holding a black assault rifle. The rifle itself is sleek and modern in design. Separately, there is an overlay on the screen displaying ammunition count and other data, which is not physically attached to the rifle but part of the game's user interface. The player navigates through an outdoor environment featuring a two-story building with a staircase on the exterior. The building is surrounded by trees and open space. On-screen graphics include a mini-map and player information, indicating a multiplayer setting. The player moves towards the building, suggesting an objective or exploration within the game.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good for this video. Here is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is inaccurate in its description of the chronological order of events. The player does not immediately move forward. They are stationary at the beginning, and an explosion occurs near the building before they start moving. The caption also misrepresents the initial direction of movement; the player first turns left and moves forward, passing the building, rather than moving directly \"towards\" it from their starting position.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption omits key events visible in the video. It fails to mention that the player is stationary for the first few seconds and that a large explosion happens in front of them before they decide to move. These are significant actions (or inactions) that set the context for the subsequent movement.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Chronological Order:** The caption fails to present the actions in the correct chronological order by skipping the initial stationary period and the explosion.\n*   **Avoid Speculation:** The caption violates the instruction to avoid speculative statements. The phrase \"suggesting an exploration or objective within the game\" is an interpretation of the player's intent, not a description of their visible motion.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The final sentence, \"Throughout the movement, on-screen graphics display ammunition count and player information, indicating a multiplayer setting,\" describes the user interface rather than the subject's motion. The interpretation \"indicating a multiplayer setting\" is also a conclusion, not a direct observation of movement. The instructions state to focus on the subject's motion.\n\nIn summary, the caption misorders the events, omits important actions, and includes speculative interpretations and descriptions of the UI, all of which go against the provided guidelines.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a first-person perspective, a player holding a rifle is initially stationary, looking towards a two-story building. A large explosion occurs in the area in front of them. After the explosion, the player turns to their left and moves forward, running alongside the building before approaching an exterior staircase and beginning to ascend it.",
