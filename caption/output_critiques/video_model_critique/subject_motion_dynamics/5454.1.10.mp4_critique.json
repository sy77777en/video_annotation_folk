    "pre_caption": "A group of people are standing on a metal railing, looking down at the camera. The background shows a cloudy sky and a tree branch with bare leaves. A sign on the railing reads 'NO BALL GAMES.' The individuals are dressed in various winter clothing, including jackets and hats. Some people are leaning on the railing, while others are standing upright. The camera remains stationary, capturing the group from a low angle, emphasizing their height and the railing.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the salient motions and dynamics of the primary subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary movements, or describe all subjects' collective motion if that is more appropriate.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good for this video.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is mostly accurate in its description of the visual elements. However, the statement that the people are \"standing on a metal railing\" is incorrect; they are standing on a walkway *behind* the railing.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is very complete in describing the static scene, including the subjects, their clothing, the background, and the sign.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption fails to adhere to several key instructions:\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The primary instruction is to describe the subject's motion. This video is a static shot with no movement. The instructions state, \"If the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\" The caption does not mention the lack of movement and instead provides a lengthy, detailed description of a static scene, which is contrary to the instruction.\n*   **Avoid Subjective/Interpretive Language:** The phrase \"emphasizing their height and the railing\" is an interpretation of the filmmaker's intent or the effect of the camera angle. This violates the rule to avoid emotional or subjective descriptions.\n*   **Avoid Describing Camera Work:** The caption describes the camera work (\"The camera remains stationary, capturing the group from a low angle\"), which is not the subject's motion and should be omitted.\n*   **Conciseness for Static Shots:** For a video with no motion, the caption is far too detailed, describing clothing, the sky, and a tree. The instructions call for a brief mention of the lack of movement, not a full scene description.",
