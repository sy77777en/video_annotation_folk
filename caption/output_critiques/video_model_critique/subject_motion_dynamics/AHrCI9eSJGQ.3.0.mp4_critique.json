  "generated_critique": "The caption fails to describe the subject's motion as required by the instructions. Instead of detailing the movement of the container ship, it describes the scene, the shot type (\"wide-angle, time-lapse view\"), and the visual composition (\"leading the eye out to the open ocean\"). The description of the clouds moving rapidly is noted, but the primary subject's motion—the ship sailing forward through the water—is completely omitted. Additionally, the caption uses subjective adjectives like \"dramatic\" and \"warmly lit,\" which are explicitly forbidden. The description should be rewritten to focus solely on the container ship's forward progression across the sea.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A time-lapse from the bow of a large container ship shows the vessel moving forward through the ocean. The water appears as a blurred, smooth surface due to the long exposure, indicating the ship's steady advance, while clouds move quickly across the sky.",
