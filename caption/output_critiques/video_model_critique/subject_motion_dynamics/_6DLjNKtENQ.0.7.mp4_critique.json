    "pre_caption": "The woman, dressed in a dark uniform with gold insignia, is seen in a dimly lit environment. She begins to turn her head to the right, gradually shifting her gaze upwards. The background remains consistent, with another person in a camouflage uniform visible on the left and a hand on the right. The woman continues to turn her head, now looking more upwards and to the right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **In the video, a woman with light skin and dark hair pulled back is shown from the chest up, facing towards the right and looking slightly upwards. She wears a headset with a microphone positioned near her slightly open mouth. Her attire is a dark, patterned uniform featuring gold-colored insignia on the collar points. Partially visible behind her on the left is another person wearing a camouflage uniform with a circular patch on the upper sleeve. In the background to the right of the woman, another person's hand is partially visible.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption includes unnecessary details about the subject's appearance (\"dressed in a dark uniform with gold insignia\"), the environment (\"dimly lit\"), and static background elements (\"another person... visible on the left and a hand on the right\"), which detracts from the primary focus on motion as required by the instructions. Additionally, the description of the head movement is split into two redundant sentences. The caption should be revised to a single, concise sentence that describes the continuous action of the woman turning her head to the right and upwards.",
