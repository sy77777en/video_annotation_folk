    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A man is shown in a dark, heavily silhouetted profile shot. A bright light source from behind and to the left illuminates the outline of his head, shoulders, and hands, while the rest of his form is cast in deep shadow. His head is bowed forward, and his hands are clasped together in front of his mouth. Due to the dramatic lighting, his facial features, expression, and clothing are not visible.**",

The video shows a silhouetted man who remains entirely motionless. The description of his pose—head bowed and hands clasped in front of his mouth—is precise.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is complete. Since there is no movement, it correctly describes the subject's static state, which is the only relevant information regarding motion.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The caption correctly follows the instruction for a subject with no movement by stating that the man \"remains completely still.\"\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, clear, and direct.\n*   **Objectivity:** It avoids any subjective or emotional language, sticking to a factual description of the pose.\n*   **No Speculation:** The caption does not speculate about the man's feelings or the context, adhering strictly to what is visible.\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or markdown.\n\nThe caption is a model example of how to describe a static subject according to the provided guidelines.",
