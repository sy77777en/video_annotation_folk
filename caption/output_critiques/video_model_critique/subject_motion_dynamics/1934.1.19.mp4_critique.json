    "pre_caption": "The person in the white suit begins by standing facing forward, then turns to their right, showing the side profile of the suit.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a person dressed in a full-body white suit, including a helmet and gloves, standing on a dark platform. The individual appears to be male, with a light skin tone visible on the face. The suit is form-fitting, and the person stands upright, facing forward. The setting is minimalistic, with the person being the central focus against a dark background.**",

  "generated_critique": "The provided caption is not suitable for the video.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is factually incorrect. It claims, \"They continue to turn, now facing the back,\" which does not happen in the video. The person only turns to their side before turning back to the front. This is a significant error that misrepresents the subject's motion.\n\n**Completeness:** The description of the motion is incomplete and inaccurate. It misses the subtle initial turn and fabricates a full turn to the back.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Chronological Order:** While the caption attempts a chronological order, it includes an action that does not occur, breaking the sequence of actual events.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The caption does focus on motion, but the description is wrong.\n*   **Avoid Speculation:** The phrase \"appears to be speaking\" is slightly speculative, although supported by the audio. A more direct description focusing only on visible motion would be better.\n\nIn summary, the caption fails because it contains a major factual inaccuracy about the subject's movement, making it an unreliable description of the video's content.",
