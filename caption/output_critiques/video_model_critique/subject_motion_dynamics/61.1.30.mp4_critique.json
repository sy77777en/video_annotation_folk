    "pre_caption": "The man, dressed in a white uniform and cap, is in a room with dim lighting and a hanging lamp in the background. He begins to move his arm and flex his bicep, appearing to dance. The background includes a window with curtains and some red lights, possibly from electronic devices. The man continues to flex his arm and dance, moving his body rhythmically.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a man wearing a white uniform with short sleeves and a matching white cap with a red stripe. He has a medium skin tone, short dark hair, and is wearing glasses. The man is positioned in a dimly lit setting, and his facial hair is neatly trimmed. In the video, he is seen raising his arm and flexing his bicep, appearing to dance very relaxedly. The lighting casts a warm glow, highlighting his profile and the details of his attire.**",

  "generated_critique": "Feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is inaccurate and does not adhere to the provided instructions.\n\n- **Accuracy:** The caption inaccurately describes the man's action as \"flexing his bicep.\" While he moves his arm, a clear bicep flex is not visible.\n- **Completeness:** The description is not focused on motion. It spends too much time describing the subject's static appearance (\"dressed in a white uniform and cap\") and the background (\"dim lighting,\" \"hanging lamp,\" \"window with curtains,\" \"red lights\"), which the instructions explicitly state to avoid.\n- **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    - The caption fails to focus on the subject's motion, instead detailing the setting and the subject's attire.\n    - It uses speculative language like \"appearing to dance\" and \"possibly from electronic devices,\" which is forbidden by the instructions.\n    - It describes an action (\"flex his bicep\") that is not clearly visible, violating the rule to avoid describing uncertain events.\n\nA more appropriate caption would be: \"A man in a white cap turns his head and upper body to his right, swaying rhythmically in a dimly lit room.\"",
