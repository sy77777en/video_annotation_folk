    "pre_caption": "A rally car is seen driving at high speed on a dirt road, producing a significant amount of dust and smoke that trails behind it. The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility. The background consists of a dry, arid landscape with sparse vegetation and distant hills, indicating a desert-like environment. The car continues to navigate the winding path, with the dust cloud becoming more prominent as it progresses.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a dark-colored rally car, either black or dark blue, driving at high speed on a dirt road, creating a large cloud of dust and smoke behind it. The car is sleek and aerodynamic, with visible racing decals and a spoiler. It navigates a winding path, suggesting dynamic movement and precision driving. The surrounding landscape is arid, with sparse vegetation and distant hills, emphasizing the car's motion and the dust trail it leaves. The scene captures the essence of a high-energy rally race in a desert-like environment.**",

  "generated_critique": "Feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is generally accurate in describing the basic elements of the scene (a car on a dirt road creating smoke). However, it is inaccurate in its description of the motion. It describes the car as \"driving\" and \"maneuvering,\" which is too generic. The car's primary motion is drifting or sliding sideways through the turn, which is a more specific and accurate description.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is incomplete because it omits the most significant aspect of the car's movement: the drift. The massive cloud of smoke is a direct result of the car sliding with its tires spinning, and the caption fails to make this connection clear.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Abstract/Subjective Language:** The caption directly violates the instruction to avoid abstract descriptions. The phrase \"emphasizing its speed and agility\" is a subjective interpretation, and a nearly identical phrase is used in the instructions as an example of what to avoid.\n*   **Focus on Motion vs. Appearance:** The caption describes the car's appearance (\"maintains a low, sleek profile\"), which is explicitly discouraged by the instructions that state to \"focus on the subject's motion.\"\n*   **Specificity of Motion:** The caption uses generic verbs like \"driving,\" \"maneuvers,\" and \"navigate.\" The instructions call for specifying *how* the subject moves. A better description would use a more precise verb like \"drifts\" or \"slides sideways.\"\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption includes a lengthy description of the background (\"a dry, arid landscape with sparse vegetation and distant hills...\"), which detracts from the primary focus on the subject's motion.\n\nIn summary, the caption is too general, includes forbidden subjective and descriptive language, and fails to accurately capture the specific, dynamic motion of the car drifting.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a high-angle, trailing perspective, a rally car drifts sideways at high speed around a bend on a dirt road. As the car slides through the turn, its spinning rear tires generate a massive, thick cloud of white smoke and dust that billows out, completely obscuring the back of the vehicle and the road behind it.",
