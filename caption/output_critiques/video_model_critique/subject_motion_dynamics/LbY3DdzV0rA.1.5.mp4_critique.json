  "generated_critique": "The caption begins with an introductory sentence, \"This is a dramatic time-lapse video of a storm moving over the Grand Canyon,\" which should be removed as it is not a description of motion. The instruction is to avoid emotional or subjective adjectives, so \"dramatic\" and \"vast\" should be deleted. The description of the motion itself is accurate but can be made more concise. The two sentences describing the motion can be combined to create a single, direct statement.",
