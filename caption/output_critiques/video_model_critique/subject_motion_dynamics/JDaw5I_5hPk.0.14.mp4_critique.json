  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly begins by describing the shot type (\"This is a static, scenic shot\") and focuses heavily on static scenery (\"Large rock formations are visible\"), which goes against the instruction to prioritize the description of motion. The motion of the waves and the people is mentioned only briefly at the end. The description should be revised to focus on the movement within the scene, using the static elements as context. For instance, the caption should describe the waves rolling ashore and the figures walking in the distance as the primary content.",
