  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption accurately describes the static elements of the scene (a glacier, a mountain, a cloudy sky). However, it is inaccurate in its primary purpose, which is to describe the motion. The description \"The camera moves swiftly\" is too generic and fails to capture the specific and dynamic flight path shown.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is incomplete. It completely misses the most significant actions in the video: the camera first dives down into a deep crevasse between two large sections of the glacier and then pulls up to fly over the jagged, icy surface. This chronological sequence of movements is the central focus of the video, and its omission makes the description inadequate.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The caption fails this instruction. It dedicates most of its length to describing the scenery (\"deep, icy crevasses and jagged formations,\" \"dark, rocky mountain,\" \"cloudy sky\") rather than the subject's motion. The motion is only mentioned in one vague, final phrase.\n*   **Chronological Order:** The caption does not present the actions in chronological order because it doesn't describe the distinct movements at all.\n*   **Clarity of Action:** The description \"moves swiftly\" is not a clear or specific description of the action. It doesn't convey the dive into the crevasse or the flight over the top.\n*   **Avoid Subjective Adjectives:** The caption uses the subjective adjective \"dramatic,\" which is explicitly forbidden by the instructions.\n\nIn summary, the caption misinterprets the video as a simple scenery shot and describes the static environment. It should have focused on the dynamic and sequential movement of the camera, which is the most salient aspect of the footage.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "An aerial shot begins with the camera diving down into a deep, narrow crevasse within a glacier. After flying through the crevasse, the camera pulls up and continues forward, flying low over the jagged, snow-covered surface of the ice. A dark, rocky mountain face is visible to the right under an overcast sky.",
