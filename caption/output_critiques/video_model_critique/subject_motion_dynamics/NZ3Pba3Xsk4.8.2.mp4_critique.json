    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective, the camera follows a group of four people as they walk along a wooden path in a park-like setting. A man and a woman in the center walk steadily forward. On the left, another man and woman, who are initially standing still, begin to walk, joining the others as the group proceeds along the path.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **This video, shot from a first-person perspective, follows a group of four young adults in a park. The two central figures are a man and a woman walking away from the camera. The man, on the right, has short dark hair and wears a blue denim jacket over a white t-shirt and black pants. The woman next to him has shoulder-length brown hair and is dressed in a beige long-sleeved top and a long teal skirt, carrying a large navy and white tote bag. To their left, another man with short, dyed-blond hair wears a white shirt, a brown vest, and dark green pants while holding a white plastic bag. On the far left, a woman with dark, shoulder-length hair stands wearing a blue denim jacket and grey pants, holding a green tote bag and looking at her phone. Three of the individuals are clearly wearing white face masks, while it is unclear if the woman with the large navy and white tote bag is also wearing one.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains speculative statements, such as \"poised to take photos at any moment\" and \"pauses to take a photo,\" which are not definitively shown in the video. These should be replaced with factual descriptions of the observable actions, like \"holds her phone\" and \"pauses while looking to the left.\" The introductory sentence focuses on the camera and setting and uses the subjective term \"dynamic scene,\" whereas the instructions require a focus on the subjects' motion. The description should start directly with the subjects' actions to be more concise and compliant. Finally, the chronological flow could be improved by describing the events as a continuous sequence from the camera's moving perspective, rather than as separate descriptions of two groups. For instance, framing the action as the camera follows one couple while another couple approaches and passes would create a more integrated and chronological narrative.",
