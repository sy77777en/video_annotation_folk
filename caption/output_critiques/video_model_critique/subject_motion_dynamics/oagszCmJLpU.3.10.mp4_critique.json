  "generated_critique": "The caption includes subjective adjectives like \"dramatic\" and \"eerie,\" as well as the speculative phrase \"appears to,\" all of which are prohibited by the instructions. The description of motion is also somewhat abstract with the word \"evolves.\" The caption should be revised to describe the motion more directly and factually. It should state that the layered storm cloud rotates as internal lightning flashes, illuminating its structure, while a column of rain falls from its base.",

The cloud has a stacked, layered structure that is illuminated from within by flashes of internal lightning, which cast a purple and white light.
