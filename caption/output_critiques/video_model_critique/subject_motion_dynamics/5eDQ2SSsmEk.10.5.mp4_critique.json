  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly focuses on describing the camera's motion (\"the camera moves to the left\") and includes subjective interpretations (\"dynamic scene,\" \"moody, atmospheric setting\"), which violates the instructions. The video is a scenery shot without a salient moving subject. According to the instructions, the description should briefly note this and describe the scene's elements. The caption should be revised to remove the description of camera movement and the subjective phrases, focusing instead on the visible action of the rain falling between the illuminated structures.",
