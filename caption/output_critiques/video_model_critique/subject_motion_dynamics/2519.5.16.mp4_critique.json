    "pre_caption": "The video shows a man with light skin and short, dark hair. He has a slight beard and mustache, and his expression appears contemplative. He is wearing a collared shirt with a checkered pattern. The man is facing forward, with his gaze initially directed downward and his eyes appearing heavy-lidded. He then slightly raises his head and opens his eyes, suggesting a shift in focus or thought. His facial features are prominent, and the lighting highlights the texture of his skin.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a man with light skin and short, dark hair.

The man is facing forward, with his gaze initially directed downward and his eyes appearing heavy-lidded. He then slightly raises his head and opens his eyes, suggesting a shift in focus or thought.

  "generated_critique": "This caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n*   **Focus on Motion vs. Appearance:** The instructions state to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions\" and to avoid describing appearance unless necessary to differentiate subjects. The caption violates this by dedicating a significant portion to describing the man's appearance: \"a man with light skin and short, dark hair. He has a slight beard and mustache... He is wearing a collared shirt with a checkered pattern... His facial features are prominent, and the lighting highlights the texture of his skin.\" These details are irrelevant to the motion.\n*   **Avoid Emotional/Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction is to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The caption uses the word \"contemplative,\" which is an interpretation of the man's internal state and is subjective.\n*   **Avoid Speculative Statements:** The instructions explicitly forbid speculative statements like \"'it appears' or 'suggesting'.\" The caption violates this rule with the phrase \"suggesting a shift in focus or thought.\"\n*   **Conciseness:** Due to the inclusion of unnecessary descriptions of appearance and speculative phrases, the caption is not concise as required.\n\nThe caption does correctly present the actions in chronological order (\"initially directed downward... He then slightly raises his head and opens his eyes\"). However, the significant violations of other core instructions make it a poor example.\n\nA correct caption, following all instructions, would be:\n\nIn a close-up, a man with his eyes looking down slowly opens them and looks up toward his left.",
