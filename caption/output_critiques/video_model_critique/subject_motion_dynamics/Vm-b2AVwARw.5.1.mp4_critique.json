    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video displays a diagram on light brown, textured paper, titled \"Kafala\" in a black, bold, sans-serif font at the top. Central to the diagram is a black silhouette icon of a worker wearing a hard hat and overalls, facing forward. Above the worker, a black silhouette icon of a person in a suit and tie is connected to the worker by a dotted line featuring a chain link pattern. To the right of this chain, a black rectangular icon resembling a credit card is labeled \"VISA\" in white capital letters. The worker icon is further connected by simple black dotted lines to several other black icons. To the worker's left is an icon of a rectangular document with a small, indistinct image. Below and to the left of the worker is an icon resembling a barred window. Below the worker is an icon of a clenched fist with zig-zag lines emanating from it. To the worker's right is an icon of a circular clock face with hands. Below the clock icon is an icon of a passport with a globe symbol on its cover. An additional icon appears to the left of the worker, depicting a whip and a building with columns. An overlay number is visible in the bottom left of the frame.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is overly descriptive of static elements and includes subjective interpretation. The initial sentences describing the paper backdrop, wooden surface, and the static \"Kafala\" diagram should be removed to focus solely on the motion as instructed. The final phrase, \"enhancing the dynamic storytelling of the video,\" is subjective and must be deleted. The description of the animated sequence should be presented more concisely as a single, continuous flow of events. The chronological order is correct, but the description can be streamlined. For example, a revised caption could read: \"In an animated diagram, a series of icons sequentially appear around a central worker icon. First, a document icon materializes to the left, followed by a barred window icon at the bottom left. A clock icon then appears to the right, a passport icon at the bottom right, and a clenched fist icon directly below the worker. The sequence concludes with an icon of a whip and a building appearing in the upper left.\"",
