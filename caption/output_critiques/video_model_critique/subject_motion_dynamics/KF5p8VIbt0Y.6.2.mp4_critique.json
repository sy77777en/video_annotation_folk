The description also omits the prominent detail that the skylight glass is cracked. To improve accuracy, the final sentence should be revised to describe the camera's movement through the cracked glass and the subsequent blur and dissolve transition.",

As the camera moves downward, it passes through the sign to reveal a wet, cracked glass skylight. The camera continues its descent, moving through the broken glass as the scene blurs and dissolves into the interior of the establishment below, creating a moody and atmospheric transition.",
