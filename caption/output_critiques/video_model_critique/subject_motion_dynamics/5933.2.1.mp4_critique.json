    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up of tall, dry grass, with a blurred background of a body of water. As the camera moves upward, the person's legs and boots become visible, revealing them walking through the shallow water. The person is wearing dark, knee-high rubber boots and light-colored pants. The boots create ripples in the water as they move, indicating the person's slow, deliberate pace. The background remains consistent, showing a calm, natural setting with the water reflecting the sky.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the subject is revealed through either subject movement or camera movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video begins with a close-up of tall, dry grass, revealing a person walking through a shallow body of water. The person is wearing dark, knee-high rubber boots and light-colored pants. The boots create ripples in the water as they move, indicating the person's slow, deliberate pace. The grass initially obscures the view, but as the scene progresses, the focus shifts to the boots and the water, highlighting the interaction between the person and the natural environment.**",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption.\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is mostly accurate in its description of the scene. However, the statement \"As the camera moves upward, the person's legs and boots become visible\" is incorrect. The camera remains relatively static; the person walks into the frame from the left, becoming visible from behind the tall grass in the foreground.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption describes the main action of the person walking through water. It correctly notes the effect of this movement (ripples). However, it is overly complete in areas that the instructions advise against, such as detailed descriptions of the setting and the subject's clothing.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption does not fully adhere to the provided instructions in several key areas:\n\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The instructions state to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" The first and last sentences of the caption are dedicated entirely to describing the static scenery (grass, water, background), and another sentence is used to describe the person's clothing. This shifts the focus away from the primary action.\n*   **Conciseness:** By including extensive descriptions of the setting and attire, the caption is less concise than it could be. A more effective caption would eliminate these details and focus solely on the movement.\n*   **Describing Appearance:** The instruction is to \"Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects.\" Since there is only one person, describing their \"dark, knee-high rubber boots and light-colored pants\" is unnecessary.\n*   **Describing Subject Reveal:** While the caption notes the person becoming visible, it incorrectly attributes this to camera movement rather than the subject's own motion into the frame.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe caption successfully identifies the subject and their basic action but fails to follow the core instructions to be a concise, motion-focused description. It includes inaccurate information about camera movement and superfluous details about the scene and the subject's appearance, which detracts from its primary purpose.",
