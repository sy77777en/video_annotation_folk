    "pre_caption": "A person is holding a small notepad with a sketch of a lighthouse on it, using a pen to add details to the drawing. The sketch includes various elements of the lighthouse, such as its base, structure, and surrounding landscape. The person's hand moves the pen to add more details to the lower part of the sketch, including lines that suggest the base and additional structural elements. The background is blurred, focusing the viewer's attention on the hands, the notepad, and the drawing process.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a close-up of a person's hands holding a small notepad and sketching with a pen. The hands have a light skin tone and are focused on drawing a detailed sketch of a lighthouse on the notepad. The sketch includes the lighthouse structure with surrounding lines indicating the landscape or additional features. The pen is actively moving, suggesting the drawing is in progress. The notepad is spiral-bound at the top, and the scene emphasizes the act of drawing and the intricate details of the sketch.**",

  "generated_critique": "Feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is generally accurate in describing the scene but could be improved to better adhere to the instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:** The description of the action—a person drawing on a notepad with a pen—is correct. The identification of the drawing as a \"lighthouse\" is a reasonable interpretation, although the sketch is abstract enough that it could also be a crane or another type of tower.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is very complete, detailing the content of the sketch and the visual composition of the shot.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The caption describes the motion of the pen but also dedicates significant space to describing static elements (the content of the sketch, the blurred background). The instructions emphasize focusing on the subject's motion.\n*   **Avoid Abstract Descriptions:** The final sentence, \"The background is blurred, focusing the viewer's attention on the hands, the notepad, and the drawing process,\" describes a cinematic effect and its intended impact on the viewer. This is an abstract interpretation rather than a direct description of the subject's movement, which the instructions advise against.\n*   **Avoid Uncertainty:** While \"lighthouse\" is a plausible interpretation, calling it a \"tower-like structure\" would be more neutral and avoid describing something that isn't certain.\n*   **Conciseness:** The description could be more concise by focusing solely on the primary action of drawing.\n\nIn summary, the caption is good but violates the rules by including an abstract description of cinematic technique and by spending too much time on static details and interpretations rather than focusing concisely on the subject's motion.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a close-up, a hand holds a small notepad while another hand uses a fine-tipped pen to sketch a tower-like structure. The pen moves back and forth, adding dark, cross-hatched lines and shading to the base of the drawing.",
