    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a bald man with light-colored eyes and a short, dark beard that has some grey hairs, particularly around his mouth. He is wearing a black t-shirt. Initially, he has a neutral expression and looks towards his right with his mouth slightly open. As the video progresses, his head occasionally moves up and down as he strains, repeatedly opening his mouth to reveal his teeth. His facial expression becomes more strained, with his brow furrowed and nose wrinkled. At the end of the video, his eyes open, and he looks upwards offscreen.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is excellent. Here is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies and describes each distinct motion the man makes in the correct sequence. The description of him looking right, closing his eyes, moving his mouth, baring his teeth, and finally looking up perfectly matches the visual evidence in the video.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is comprehensive, capturing all the key movements from the beginning to the end of the clip. It doesn't miss any significant actions, such as the tensing of the facial muscles or the subtle head movements, which are crucial to understanding the subject's motion.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption successfully follows all the given rules:\n*   **Chronological Order:** The actions are presented in the exact order they occur.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The description is centered entirely on the man's physical movements (eyes, head, mouth, facial muscles) rather than his static appearance.\n*   **Objectivity:** It uses neutral, descriptive language (e.g., \"mouth slightly open,\" \"facial muscles tense\") and avoids any subjective or emotional interpretation (e.g., \"looks sad,\" \"in pain\").\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The description is a single, well-structured paragraph written in simple, clear English.\n*   **No Speculation:** It refrains from making any assumptions about why the man is making these expressions.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the instructions. It is precise, objective, and provides a complete account of the subject's motion in chronological order.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The man looks toward his right with his mouth slightly open. He then closes his eyes. With his eyes remaining closed, his head tilts down as he repeatedly opens and closes his mouth, sometimes grimacing and baring his teeth. Finally, he tilts his head up, opens his eyes, and looks upward.",
