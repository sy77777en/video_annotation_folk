    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a bar chart showing a distribution of data related to coughs during a quiz show scenario. The chart is predominantly black with vertical bars representing the number of simulations on the y-axis and the number of coughs on the x-axis. A red vertical line is present, indicating a specific data point of interest. The text surrounding the chart discusses probabilities and scenarios related to the data, providing context for the analysis. As the video progresses, the camera gradually zooms in on the bar chart, making the details of the data points and the red vertical line more prominent.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a bar chart displaying a distribution of data related to coughs during a quiz show scenario. The chart is predominantly black with vertical bars representing the number of simulations on the y-axis and the number of coughs on the x-axis. A red vertical line is present, indicating a specific data point of interest. The chart is titled \"Simulations assuming half of all coughs are Whitlock,\" suggesting a statistical analysis. The text surrounding the chart discusses probabilities and scenarios related to the data, providing context for the analysis.**",

The instructions state to focus on the subject's motion and avoid repeating details. The description of the camera's zoom-in motion is accurate, but it should be the primary focus. The caption should be revised to remove the detailed description of the static chart and text, and instead, concisely state that the view slowly zooms in on a static image of a document containing a bar chart.",
