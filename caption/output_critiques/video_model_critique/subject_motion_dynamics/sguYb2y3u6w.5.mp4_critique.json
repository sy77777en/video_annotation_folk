    "pre_caption": "The yellow bird-like creature is initially seen sitting on a green grassy field with scattered small white flowers, surrounded by broken pieces of a red and yellow object. The creature's expression changes from neutral to slightly surprised as it turns its head to the right. The camera then zooms out, revealing the green alligator-like creature and the grey raccoon-like creature standing next to the yellow bird-like creature. An ambulance with an open door is parked nearby, indicating a possible emergency situation.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the main subjects in this video exhibit **atypical motion, posture, or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a small, yellow, bird-like creature with a notably atypical appearance: it has a large head with an orange beak, a round purple body, small yellow heart-shaped hands, and red feet, and is shown sitting. Another prominent subject is a bipedal, green alligator-like creature, rendered unusual by its attire consisting of a white nurse's cap with a red cross and brown pants secured by a dark brown belt. A third character is a small, grey raccoon-like creature, whose atypical feature is an orange shirt, complementing its striped tail.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption inaccurately describes the motion of the new subjects and includes speculative information. The green alligator-like creature and the grey raccoon-like creature do not simply appear \"standing\"; they run into the frame from the left and stop next to the yellow bird. This running motion is a key action that has been omitted. Additionally, the phrase \"indicating a possible emergency situation\" is a speculative statement, which is explicitly forbidden by the instructions. The detailed description of the fragments on the grass is also unnecessary, as the instructions state to focus on motion. The caption should be revised to describe the bird sitting, followed by the alligator and raccoon running into the frame and stopping, and the reveal of the ambulance, without any interpretation.",
