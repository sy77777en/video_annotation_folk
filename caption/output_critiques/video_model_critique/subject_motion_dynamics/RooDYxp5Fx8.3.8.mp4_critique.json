It also repeats information about the city street scene and does not clearly present the actions in chronological order. The motion of the main subjects should be described more specifically: the camera moves steadily forward along the sidewalk, a pedestrian holding a white umbrella walks toward the camera and passes by, and a construction worker stands near a building entrance, occasionally moving their arms as they work. The movement of vehicles on the road can be briefly mentioned, but the focus should remain on the main visible actions. Remove subjective language like \"bright and lively atmosphere\" and avoid restating static details.",
