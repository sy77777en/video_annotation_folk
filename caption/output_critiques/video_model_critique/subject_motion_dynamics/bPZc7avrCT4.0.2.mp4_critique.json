    "pre_caption": "A human foot, clad in a white cleat and red sock, swings from left to right, striking a purple water balloon that is positioned next to a black, circular kicking tee on green grass. Upon impact, the balloon bursts, sending a spray of water droplets upwards and outwards. The foot continues its follow-through motion to the right, passing through the dispersing water.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A human foot, clad in a white cleat with black and orange details and a red sock featuring a white and blue pattern, is poised next to a purple water balloon that has already burst. The balloon, positioned next to a black, circular kicking tee on green grass, has sent a spray of water droplets into the air.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly describes the foot's motion, stating it moves \"from the right side of the frame further to the right,\" when it actually moves from the center to the right in a follow-through motion. The description of the balloon as \"positioned\" is also inaccurate, as it is actively bursting from the beginning of the clip. The caption fails to establish a clear chronological and causal link between the kick and the bursting balloon, describing them as separate events. Additionally, the phrase \"appears to be bursting\" is speculative and should be replaced with a more direct statement. The description should be revised to state that a foot follows through on a kick, passing through a bursting water balloon on a tee, which sends a spray of water into the air.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a close-up, slow-motion shot on a green grass field, a foot wearing a white cleat and a red sock completes the follow-through of a kick. The foot passes through a purple water balloon as it bursts from the impact, sending a large spray of water droplets into the air. A black kicking tee sits on the grass to the left of the explosion.",
