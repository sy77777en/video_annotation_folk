  "generated_critique": "The caption describes the static elements of the scene but completely omits the motion, which is the primary focus of the instructions. It fails to describe the camera's movement, which is the most prominent action in the video. The caption should be rewritten to describe the camera's aerial flight as it moves forward and descends along the canal toward a large, arched bridge. It should also briefly mention the boats moving through the water.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This dynamic aerial shot follows a flight path forward and down along the Grand Canal in Venice, Italy, during a golden sunrise or sunset. The camera's perspective moves steadily toward the iconic, arched Rialto Bridge. Below, various boats navigate the waterway, passing by the historic, red-roofed buildings that line the canal.",
