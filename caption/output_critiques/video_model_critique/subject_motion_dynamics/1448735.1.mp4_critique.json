    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a view of a dense forest, featuring tall trees with green foliage and a forest floor covered in moss and fallen logs. As the camera moves forward, more details of the forest become visible, including a path winding through the trees and scattered rocks. The sunlight filters through the canopy, casting dappled shadows on the ground. The camera continues to move forward, revealing more of the forest's natural beauty, including a large moss-covered rock and additional fallen logs. The path becomes more visible, leading deeper into the forest. The camera's movement is smooth and steady, providing a continuous view of the serene and lush forest environment.",

  "generated_critique": "Feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:** The description of the visual content and the camera's movement is factually accurate.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption describes the motion that occurs throughout the video.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":** The caption uses subjective phrases like \"natural beauty\" and \"serene,\" which are explicitly forbidden by the instructions. The word \"lush\" is also descriptive in a way that can be considered subjective.\n*   **Violation of \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details\":** The caption spends a significant amount of its length describing the static scenery (e.g., \"tall trees with green foliage,\" \"forest floor covered in moss,\" \"sunlight filters through the canopy\"). The instructions state to focus on motion and avoid repeating descriptive details. While the camera's motion is mentioned, it is secondary to the detailed environmental description.\n*   **Lack of Conciseness:** As a result of including excessive scenic details, the caption is not as concise as it should be. A proper caption focusing only on the motion would be much shorter.\n\nIn summary, the caption correctly identifies the camera's movement but violates the core rules by including subjective language and focusing more on describing the static environment than the motion itself.",
