    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a view of a dense forest, featuring tall trees with green foliage and a forest floor covered in moss and fallen logs. As the camera moves forward, more details of the forest become visible, including a path winding through the trees and scattered rocks. The sunlight filters through the canopy, casting dappled shadows on the ground. The camera continues to move forward, revealing more of the forest's natural beauty, including a large moss-covered rock and additional fallen logs. The path becomes more visible, leading deeper into the forest. The camera's movement is smooth and steady, providing a continuous view of the serene and lush forest environment.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is overly descriptive of the static scenery and includes subjective language, which violates the instructions. The instruction states that for scenery shots without salient subjects, the description should be a brief note of one to three sentences. The current caption is too long and focuses more on describing the forest's appearance than the camera's motion. The phrases \"featuring tall trees with green foliage and a forest floor covered in moss and fallen logs,\" \"The sunlight filters through the canopy, casting dappled shadows on the ground,\" and descriptions of the \"path,\" \"rocks,\" and \"logs\" should be removed. Additionally, subjective adjectives like \"natural beauty,\" \"serene,\" and \"lush\" should be deleted. The description should be condensed to simply state that this is a scenery shot where the camera moves steadily forward through a forest.",
