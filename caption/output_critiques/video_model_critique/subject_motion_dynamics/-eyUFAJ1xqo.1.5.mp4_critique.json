    "pre_caption": "A man and a woman dance next to each other in a room with a patterned, illuminated wall. They sway their bodies and move their arms rhythmically in place. They briefly turn to face each other before continuing to dance as the lighting on the wall behind them shifts from red to a mix of red and blue.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A man and a woman stand close to each other in a dimly lit setting. The man has short dark hair and a full dark beard. He is wearing an unbuttoned black shirt, exposing his bare chest, and dark pants. The woman, positioned on the left side of the frame, might have her dark hair styled in a bun and is wearing a white, long-sleeved robe or shirt with black trim along the collar. They exchange glances and continue dancing together.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption omits the specific initial actions of the subjects: the woman adjusts a white shirt and the man opens his dark shirt as they begin to dance. Additionally, the description of the lighting change is imprecise; the wall becomes bisected with red light on the left and blue light on the right, rather than a general \"mix.\" Finally, stating they dance \"in place\" is slightly inaccurate, as they take small steps within a confined area.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a room with a patterned wall glowing entirely red, a woman adjusts her white shirt while a man opens his dark shirt to reveal his chest. They begin to dance, swaying their bodies and moving their arms rhythmically while taking small steps. They briefly turn to face each other before the lighting on the wall behind them shifts, becoming bisected with red light on the left and blue light on the right as they continue their dance.",
