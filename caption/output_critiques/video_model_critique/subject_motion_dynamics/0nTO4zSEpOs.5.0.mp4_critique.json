The corridor has a few wooden benches on the left side and a series of shops on the right, with a blue banner hanging above one of the shops. As the camera moves forward, more of the shops and their signs become visible, including a digital display board and a chair placed outside the shop. The camera continues to move closer to the shop with the blue banner, revealing more details of the shop's entrance and the surrounding area, including a potted plant and additional seating. The camera finally stops in front of the shop, showing the blue banner in detail, the digital display board, and the shop's interior through the glass windows.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is overly descriptive of the static environment, which goes against the instruction to focus on motion. The first sentence, which describes the corridor's appearance, should be removed. The subsequent sentences correctly describe the camera's motion but are too wordy. The entire paragraph should be rewritten to be more concise, focusing solely on the camera's forward movement through the corridor, mentioning what is revealed as it moves, and noting its final stop in front of the restaurant. The mention of the distant person walking is appropriate but should be integrated more smoothly.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera moves forward through a modern corridor, passing wooden benches on the left while a person walks in the distance. It advances toward a restaurant on the right, marked by a large blue banner. As the camera gets closer, illuminated signs and the entrance details come into focus, before it stops directly in front of the restaurant, offering a clear view of the banner and signage.",
