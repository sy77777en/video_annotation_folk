    "pre_caption": "On a street lined with traditional shops adorned with lanterns and signs, a group of people walk along the sidewalk. A woman in a brown jacket and black shorts, wearing a mask, turns her head to look at a shop display. She continues to walk forward, glancing at the shop window, which showcases various items. The woman then stops and stands still, closely examining the shop display.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the salient motions and dynamics of the primary subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary movements, or describe all subjects' collective motion if that is more appropriate.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is good.\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption accurately describes the scene and the subject's actions in chronological order. The woman in the brown jacket does walk, turn her head to look at the shop, continue walking while looking, and then stop to examine the display more closely.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is complete, capturing the primary motion of the main subject while also providing context about the setting and the general movement of other people on the sidewalk.\n\n**Adherence to instructions:**\n*   **Chronological Order:** The actions are correctly listed in the order they occur.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The description centers on the woman's movements (walking, turning her head, stopping) rather than just her appearance.\n*   **Clarity and Simplicity:** The language is simple, clear, and natural.\n*   **Objectivity:** The caption avoids subjective or emotional language and speculative statements.\n*   **Specificity:** It clearly describes the specific actions, such as \"turns her head to look\" and \"stops and stands still,\" which is more descriptive than just \"looks.\"\n\nThe caption effectively follows all the provided guidelines.",
