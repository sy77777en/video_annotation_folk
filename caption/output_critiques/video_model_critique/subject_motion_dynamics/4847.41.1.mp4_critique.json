    "pre_caption": "A small boat with five people is seen rowing on the water, moving steadily towards a large ship. The camera follows the boat's movement, capturing the rowers' synchronized effort. As the boat gets closer, the camera pans right, revealing more of the ship's deck and a person standing on it. The person on the deck, dressed in a suit and hat, watches the approaching boat. The scene concludes with the boat nearing the ship, and the person on the deck continuing to observe.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video captures a small boat with five people on board approaching a large ship. The boat is in the sea, and the individuals appear to be rowing. As the boat nears the ship, the camera pans right, revealing part of the ship's structure and a person standing on the deck. This person is positioned on the right side of the frame, observing the approaching boat. The scene highlights the interaction between the small boat and the large ship, with the focus shifting from the boat to include the ship's deck and the person on it.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is a good attempt but has some significant inaccuracies and areas for improvement.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n- The caption states there are \"five people\" in the boat. While the exact number is difficult to discern, this is a reasonable estimation.\n- The most significant inaccuracy is the phrase \"the rowers' synchronized effort.\" The video clearly shows only one person rowing with two oars, while the others are passengers.\n- The description of the person on the deck as being \"dressed in a suit and hat\" is questionable. The person appears to be wearing a uniform with a specific type of cap (like a sailor's or officer's cap), not a standard suit.\n\n**Completeness:**\n- The caption successfully covers the main sequence of events in chronological order: the boat's approach, the appearance of the person on the deck, and the continued observation.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n- **Chronological Order:** The caption correctly presents the actions in the order they occur.\n- **Specificity of Motion:** The description of the rowing motion is inaccurate. The instructions ask for specific descriptions of actions, and \"rowers' synchronized effort\" misrepresents the action shown.\n- **Objectivity:** The caption is objective and avoids emotional or speculative language.\n- **Conciseness:** The paragraph is clear and concise.\n\n**Overall Feedback:**\nThe caption's structure and chronological flow are good, but it fails on the key instruction to describe actions with accuracy and specificity. The mischaracterization of the rowing and the questionable description of the person's clothing detract from its overall quality. A more accurate caption would state that one person is rowing the boat and would describe the person on the deck's attire more generally or accurately (e.g., \"a person in a uniform and cap\").",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From the perspective of a large ship, a small rowboat with several occupants is seen on the water. One person rows the boat with two oars, propelling it steadily towards the ship. As the rowboat gets closer, the view reveals the side of the ship's deck. A person wearing a cap and what appears to be a uniform stands on the deck, leaning over the railing to watch the approaching boat as the scene concludes.",
