The description of motion is limited to the generic phrase \"sailing at sea\" and fails to describe the primary movement shown in the video. The caption should be revised to focus on the visible motion, describing how, in a timelapse from the bow of a container ship, the star-filled sky rotates across the frame from right to left above the ocean.",
