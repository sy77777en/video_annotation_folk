  "generated_critique": "The caption fails to follow the core instruction to describe motion. Instead of detailing the movement within the video, it provides a static description of the scenery. The video features significant camera motion, as it moves forward and pans up over a mountain peak, revealing a wider landscape. The caption should describe this camera movement. It also mentions that \"several skiers are present\" but does not describe their action, which is skiing down the slope. Furthermore, the caption omits that a ski lift gondola enters the frame from the right side. The adjective \"scenic\" is subjective and should be removed to adhere to the instructions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "An aerial point-of-view shot moves forward and pans upward over a snowy mountain peak, revealing a vast, snow-covered mountain range under a clear blue sky. On the slope below, several people are skiing near a prominent, snow-dusted rocky outcrop. As the camera pulls back, a black ski lift gondola enters the frame from the right. A ski lift tower and a building are also visible at the top of the peak.",
