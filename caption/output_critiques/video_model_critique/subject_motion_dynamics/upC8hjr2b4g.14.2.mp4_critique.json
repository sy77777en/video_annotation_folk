It also includes the subjective and emotional adjectives \"ominous,\" \"suspenseful,\" and \"unsettling,\" which should be avoided according to the instructions. The description of the light's action is accurate, but the surrounding phrases violate the guidelines.",

The scene is initially illuminated by a red light from a fixture above the door, which has a sign with the number \"13\" on it. A window is visible on the left wall. The red light then turns off, and the hallway becomes dark, with only a faint light remaining from the window.",
