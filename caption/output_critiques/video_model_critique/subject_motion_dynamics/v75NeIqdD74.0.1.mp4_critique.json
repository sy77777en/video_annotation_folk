    "pre_caption": "A grey and purple jet, with a dog visible in the cockpit, begins to accelerate down a runway. A yellow dog, blurred by motion, is briefly seen in the foreground. The jet then speeds rapidly along the runway, which is situated on a large, red, ship-like structure, leaving a trail of steam in its wake as it moves toward the end of the platform.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the main subjects in this video exhibit **atypical motion, posture, or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A grey and purple futuristic jet-like aircraft is depicted. The vehicle has a sleek body with wings, a tail fin, and a transparent cockpit canopy. Magenta and pink accents adorn the wings, tail, and the area around the cockpit. The aircraft is equipped with landing gear, including wheels at the front and back. Inside the cockpit, a small brown and white dog is visible, wearing a pink helmet. Initially, there is a yellow and white dog on the runway, wearing a yellow outfit and carrying directional wands on its back.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption should be revised to explicitly mention the change in camera perspective from a close-up to a wide shot, as the instructions require noting shot transitions. The description of the secondary subject, \"A yellow dog, blurred by motion, is briefly seen in the foreground,\" interrupts the flow of the main subject's action and should be integrated more smoothly into the sentence describing the jet's initial movement.",

It leaves a trail of steam in its wake as it moves toward the end of the platform, with a city skyline visible in the background.",
