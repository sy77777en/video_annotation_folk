The movement of the clouds and the light trails from cars on the highway indicate the passage of time.\n\nThe scene captures a powerful storm over a vast, open landscape at dusk. Two parallel highways stretch towards the horizon, which is illuminated by a warm, orange glow. Above, the sky is dominated by a massive, turbulent formation of dark purple and blue storm clouds, with sheets of rain visible in the distance. Brilliant flashes of lightning periodically illuminate the clouds from within, casting a dramatic pink and purple light across the sky.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption includes subjective adjectives such as \"dramatic,\" \"warm,\" \"massive,\" \"turbulent,\" and \"brilliant,\" which should be removed. The description focuses excessively on the static scenery, such as the landscape, highways, and cloud colors, instead of prioritizing the description of motion as instructed. The motion is described passively at the end of the paragraph. The caption should be rewritten to focus on the actions shown in the time-lapse, actively describing how the storm clouds move, how lightning flashes within them, and how streaks of light from cars travel along the highways.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This time-lapse video shows a thunderstorm progressing over a wide landscape. In the sky, dark clouds churn and advance, while sheets of rain descend in the distance above the horizon. Flashes of lightning periodically light up the interior of the clouds, causing them to glow. Below, long streaks of light trace the movement of cars along two parallel highways.",
