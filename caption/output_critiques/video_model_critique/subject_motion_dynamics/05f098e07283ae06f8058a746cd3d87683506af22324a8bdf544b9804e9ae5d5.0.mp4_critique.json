    "pre_caption": "The video begins with an aerial view of a dense forest, with tall trees and lush greenery covering the landscape. As the camera moves forward, a waterfall becomes visible in the distance, cascading down a rocky cliff into a small pool below. The waterfall is surrounded by dense foliage, and the water appears to be flowing steadily. The camera continues to move forward, providing a closer view of the waterfall and the pool it feeds into, which is partially obscured by the surrounding trees. The scene remains consistent with the waterfall and pool as the focal points, with the forest providing a serene and natural backdrop.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption generally follows the instruction by describing the camera’s motion in chronological order and focusing on the visible movement, which is the camera’s slow descent and forward movement toward the waterfall. However, it includes unnecessary details about the appearance of the forest and uses subjective language like “serene and natural backdrop,” which should be avoided. The caption should be more concise and focus solely on the camera’s motion and the waterfall’s steady flow, omitting redundant or appearance-based details. A more appropriate caption would be: “The camera slowly descends and moves forward over a dense forest, gradually revealing a waterfall flowing steadily into a pool below as it approaches for a closer view.”",
