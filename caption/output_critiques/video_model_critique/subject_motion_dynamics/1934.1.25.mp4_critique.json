    "pre_caption": "A small figure, dressed in a light gray outfit, stands with its back to the camera, facing a large screen that displays a close-up of a woman wearing white goggles and a white outfit with red trim. The figure slightly moves its arms and body while maintaining its position in front of the screen.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a wide shot of an individual dressed in white, standing with their back to the camera. They are positioned in front of a large screen that nearly fills the frame. The screen displays a close-up of a woman's face, who has short dark hair and is wearing white goggles on her head. The individual appears to be observing the screen, creating a contrast between their small figure and the large, detailed image of the woman's face.**",

The woman figure slightly waves her head during the video, you forget mention this. \"The figure slightly moves its arms and body while maintaining its position in front of the screen\" this is awkward, you can say \"The figure slightly moves their arms while stands still in front of the screen\".

  "generated_critique": "The user wants me to evaluate the provided caption based on a set of detailed instructions.\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n- The caption accurately describes a \"small figure, dressed in a light gray outfit, stands with its back to the camera.\"\n- It correctly identifies that this figure is \"facing a large screen that displays a close-up of a woman wearing white goggles and a white outfit with red trim.\"\n- The description of the motion, \"The figure slightly moves its arms and body while maintaining its position,\" is also accurate. The movement is very subtle, and the caption captures this well.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n- The caption is complete. It describes the main subject (the small figure), its minimal motion, and the essential context provided by the large screen in the background. It doesn't miss any key visual or motional elements.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n- **Focus on Motion:** The caption correctly focuses on the motion of the salient subject, the small figure. It precisely describes the subtle nature of the movement (\"slightly moves its arms and body while maintaining its position\").\n- **Chronological Order:** Not applicable as there is no sequence of distinct actions, but the description is logically structured.\n- **Objectivity:** The caption is objective. It uses neutral language (\"small figure,\" \"slightly moves\") and avoids any subjective interpretation or speculation.\n- **Clarity and Conciseness:** The description is clear, easy to understand, and concise.\n- **Formatting:** The caption is a single paragraph without any introductory text or markdown, as requested.\n- **Avoidance of Redundancy:** The caption does not repeat information.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is excellent. It is accurate, complete, and strictly adheres to all the provided instructions. It perfectly describes the scene and the subtle motion of the subject in a clear and objective manner. No improvements are needed.",
