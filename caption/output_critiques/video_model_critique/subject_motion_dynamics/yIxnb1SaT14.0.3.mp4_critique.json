  "generated_critique": "The caption's primary focus is on describing the static scenery rather than the motion within the video, which contradicts the instruction to \"Focus on the subject's motion.\" The description of movement is placed at the end and is too generic. The caption should be revised to lead with the most prominent motionâ€”the camera's slow zoom and clockwise roll. Furthermore, the description of the background elements' movement, such as \"Traffic moves rapidly,\" should be made more specific by describing the visual effect, for instance, the streams of light created by the vehicles.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The shot opens with a slow, clockwise pan, arcing around a lustrous golden statue on a bridge in Paris. As the camera moves, it reveals a breathtaking nighttime panorama featuring the illuminated Eiffel Tower in the distance, its reflection shimmering on the dark waters of the Seine River. Along the riverbanks, the movement of traffic is captured as long, flowing streaks of red and white light, adding a dynamic element to the iconic cityscape.",
