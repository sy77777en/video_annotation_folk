The church has a long, pointed spire and a series of windows along its facade. The graveyard is adjacent to the church, with numerous gravestones scattered across the area. A dirt path runs from the church towards the graveyard, winding through the landscape. The surrounding area includes trees and some greenery, providing a natural border around the church and graveyard. The camera remains steady, maintaining a consistent view of the church and its surroundings throughout the video.",

  "generated_critique": "This caption is not good because it fails to follow the core instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:** The description of the scene is accurate. The video does show a church with a spire, a graveyard, and a steady camera.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption describes the static scene in detail.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption fails to adhere to the instructions in several key ways:\n*   The main instruction is to describe **motion**. This video is completely static.\n*   For videos with no movement, the instruction is to \"briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\"\n*   The provided caption does the opposite. It goes into extensive detail about the static appearance of the church, graveyard, and path, which violates the instruction to be brief and focus on the lack of motion. A correct caption would simply state that the video is a stationary aerial shot of a church and graveyard, with no movement occurring.",
