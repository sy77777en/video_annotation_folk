    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a woman with medium skin tone and straight, shoulder-length dark hair. She is wearing large, polygonal glasses and a teal hoodie. Her expression is calm and slightly smiling. Initially, her head is turned to her right before she turns to face forward. She appears relaxed and is the central focus of the video.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is mostly accurate. The woman does start by facing to her right and then turns her head forward. However, the phrase \"initially looks to her right\" is slightly imprecise, as her eyes are closed at the start of the video; \"facing to her right\" would be a more accurate description of her posture.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption successfully captures the primary motion in the video, which is the slow turning of the woman's head. It correctly notes her starting position and the end of the movement.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption fails to adhere to several key instructions:\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The caption begins with a detailed description of the static background (\"a framed picture on the left and two decorative plates on the right, all set against a patterned wallpaper\"). The instructions explicitly state to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\"\n*   **Avoid Unnecessary Appearance Details:** The caption describes the woman as \"dressed in a teal hoodie.\" The instructions state to \"Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects.\" Since she is the only subject, this detail is superfluous.\n*   **Conciseness:** By including details about the background and the subject's clothing, the caption is not as concise as it could be. The core information about the motion is diluted by these non-essential descriptions.\n\nIn summary, while the caption correctly identifies the chronological motion, it violates the core instructions by including extensive descriptions of the static background and the subject's appearance, which detracts from the primary focus on motion.",
