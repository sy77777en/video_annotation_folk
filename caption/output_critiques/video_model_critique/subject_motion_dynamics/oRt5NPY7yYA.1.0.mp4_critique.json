The green light on the vehicles gradually dims and eventually turns off as they continue to move. The vehicles maintain a steady formation and speed throughout the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the salient motions and dynamics of the primary subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary movements, or describe all subjects' collective motion if that is more appropriate.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly identifies the truck's cab as \"dark green\"; its color is not clearly discernible, so it should be described more generally as a \"dark cab.\" Additionally, the caption omits the two unlit vehicles positioned at the very front and rear of the convoy. A more accurate description would state that from an aerial view, a convoy, consisting of a central truck, five initially glowing green vehicles, and two unlit vehicles at the front and back, moves forward on a desert road. The green glow on the five vehicles then fades out as the entire convoy continues to advance in a steady formation.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From an aerial, top-down perspective, a convoy of vehicles travels along a road in a desert. The convoy is composed of a central white semi-trailer truck, two dark unlit vehicles at the front and rear, and five other vehicles that are initially glowing bright green. As the convoy proceeds in a steady formation, the green glow on the five vehicles fades out, and they continue moving forward as dark-colored vehicles.",
