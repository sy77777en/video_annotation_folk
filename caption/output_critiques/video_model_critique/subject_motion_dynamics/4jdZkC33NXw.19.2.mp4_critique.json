  "generated_critique": "Feedback:\nThe caption is accurate in its description of the visual elements in the video, such as the rainy weather, the location, the flowerbed, and the golf driving range. However, it does not fully adhere to the provided instructions.\n\nThe main issue is that the caption focuses heavily on describing the static scenery rather than the motion of the subjects, which is the primary requirement. The instructions state, \"If the video features salient human or non-human subjects, focus your description on their motion.\" In this video, the moving cars are the salient subjects. The caption dedicates only one short, generic sentence to their movement (\"Cars can be seen driving along the wet road\") while using three longer sentences to describe the stationary environment.\n\nTo better follow the instructions, the caption should be restructured to prioritize the action. It should describe the movement of the cars more specifically (e.g., \"a white car drives from right to left across the frame\") and use the scenic details as context for that movement, rather than making the scenery the main topic.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "On a wet street in a Japanese town under an overcast sky, an orange car drives away on the right side of the road as a white car enters from the right and travels down the street toward the left. The view is from a sidewalk, looking past a colorful flowerbed of yellow and purple blossoms. In the background, the tall netting of a golf driving range is visible behind the houses and power lines.",
