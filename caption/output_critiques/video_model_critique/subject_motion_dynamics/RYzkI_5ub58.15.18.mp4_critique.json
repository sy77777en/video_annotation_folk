  "generated_critique": "The caption fails to follow the instructions by describing the scene's appearance instead of the subject's motion. The instructions explicitly state to focus on motion or, if there is none, to briefly mention the lack of it. This video is a static shot, and the animals on the ice floe are motionless, a key detail that is omitted. The caption also violates the rules by using speculative language (\"possibly animals\") and subjective, abstract descriptions (\"stunning,\" \"visual complexity,\" \"enhancing the impact of the scene\"). The description should be revised to remove these elements and state concisely that the group of animals is stationary on the ice.",
