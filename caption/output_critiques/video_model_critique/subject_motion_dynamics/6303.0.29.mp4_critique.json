    "pre_caption": "On a red sports court surrounded by a metal fence, a group of eight people are engaged in a game. The central figure, wearing a green jacket and white pants, holds a basketball and begins to throw it upwards. As the basketball ascends, it starts to transform, revealing a face on its surface. The basketball continues to rise, and its face becomes more prominent, while the people around it watch. The basketball, now fully transformed into a ball with a face, moves closer to the camera, speaking as it does so.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **switching from one to another**, so the description should first describe the first subject’s motion and dynamics, followed by the second’s.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features eight people on a red sports court. Six individuals form a circle facing a person in the center, while another person stands outside the circle. A basketball, initially held by a person in the group, becomes the focal point as it transitions to the foreground, revealing a face imprinted on its surface. This transition highlights the basketball's unique design, shifting the viewer's focus from the group interaction to the ball itself.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is excellent and adheres to all the provided instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:** The description is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the setting, the number of people, the central action of throwing the ball, the surreal transformation of the basketball into an object with a face, and its final movement toward the camera while appearing to speak.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption covers the entire sequence of events in the video chronologically and comprehensively. It starts with the initial scene, follows the main action, describes the key transformation, and concludes with the final shot, leaving out no significant details.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Chronological Order:** The actions are presented in the correct sequence: the group playing, the person throwing the ball, the ball transforming as it rises, and the transformed ball moving closer and speaking.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The description is centered on movement and action (engaged in a game, throws it upwards, ascends, continues to rise, moves closer).\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, clear, and direct, forming a coherent and easy-to-understand paragraph.\n*   **Objectivity:** The caption avoids subjective or emotional language, sticking to factual observations.\n*   **Specificity:** It provides specific details, such as the \"red sports court,\" the \"metal fence,\" the central figure's clothing, and the transformation of the basketball, which are crucial to understanding the video.\n*   **Handling of Transformation:** The caption does an excellent job of describing the unusual transformation of the subject (the basketball), which is the most salient event in the video.\n\nThe caption is a perfect example of how to follow the given guidelines to produce a high-quality video description.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "On a red, fenced-in sports court, a group of people are gathered around a person in a green sweatshirt who is about to shoot a basketball. They toss the ball upwards, and as it rises, a face begins to form on its surface. The face becomes more prominent while the others watch from below. The basketball, now fully transformed with a face, then floats towards the camera as it appears to speak.",
