  "generated_critique": "The caption is factually accurate but overly long and detailed for a short scenery shot with no subject motion. The instructions specify that for such videos, the description should be brief (one to three sentences). The current caption uses four sentences and breaks down a single, continuous camera pan into multiple steps (\"The camera slowly pans...\", \"As the camera continues to move...\", \"The camera further pans...\"), which is redundant. The description should be condensed into a single sentence that describes the continuous camera motion and the key elements of the scene.",
