According to the instructions, if there is no movement, this should be briefly mentioned. The description of camera motion should be removed and replaced with a statement indicating that the video shows a static scene. The descriptive elements like \"surreal,\" \"gloomy,\" and \"cold\" are subjective and should be removed to maintain objectivity.",
