The video begins with the camera positioned at the bottom of a short, white-tiled staircase, not in the room with the pool-like design. The camera then moves forward, ascends the stairs, passes through a narrow corridor, and finally enters the larger room. The description should be corrected to reflect this sequence of motion, starting from the bottom of the stairs and moving towards the final room.",
