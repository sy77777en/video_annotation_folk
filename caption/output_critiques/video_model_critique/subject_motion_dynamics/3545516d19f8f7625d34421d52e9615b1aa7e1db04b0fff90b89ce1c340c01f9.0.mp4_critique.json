    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up aerial view of a coastal area featuring a white lighthouse with a red top, surrounded by a few buildings, including a red-roofed house and a small structure with a red roof. The camera gradually moves backward, revealing more of the coastline, which is lined with rocks and a sandy beach. As the camera continues to pull back, the surrounding landscape becomes visible, showing a dense forest extending into the distance. The sea is calm, with gentle waves lapping against the shore. A tall structure, possibly a communication tower, is seen near the forest. The camera movement is smooth and steady, providing a comprehensive view of the coastal landscape, the lighthouse, the buildings, and the natural surroundings.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides an accurate and detailed account of the camera’s motion, describing how it gradually moves backward to reveal more of the coastline and surrounding landscape in chronological order. However, it includes unnecessary details about the appearance and arrangement of buildings, the lighthouse, and the landscape, which are not required unless needed to differentiate between multiple subjects. The caption should focus solely on the camera’s motion, as there are no salient moving subjects in the video. A more concise version would be: “The camera starts with a wide aerial view centered on a lighthouse and gradually moves backward, smoothly revealing more of the coastline, forest, and sea.” Remove the extra descriptive details about the buildings, lighthouse, and landscape features to better align with the instruction.",
