In the middle distance, two figures ride camels, moving across the expansive terrain. The background is dominated by a range of dark, rocky mountains, one of which has a distinct pyramid-like shape. A rocky, dark brown slope occupies the left foreground, while a small, green bush sits on the right. In the far distance, the landscape flattens into a plain.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work. The caption is well-written and adheres closely to the instructions. Here is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description is highly accurate. All the key visual elements—the orange sand dunes, the dark rocky mountains (including the pyramid-shaped one), the foreground slope, the bush, and the distant plain—are correctly identified and described.\n*   The placement and action of the subjects (\"In the middle distance, two figures ride camels, moving...\") are also accurately captured.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is very thorough in describing the scenery and setting. It successfully covers the environment, key natural features, and subjects as instructed.\n*   **Minor Omission:** The caption does not explicitly state the time of day (daytime), although \"pale blue sky\" strongly implies it.\n*   **Notable Omission:** The caption fails to mention the white subtitles that appear at the bottom of the screen. The instructions require specifying any overlay elements, such as captions or subtitles.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths:** The caption excels at following the core guidelines. It is a single, coherent paragraph, uses simple and objective language, avoids speculation (\"appears,\" \"might be\"), and correctly focuses on the scenery rather than providing excessive detail about the subjects. It also successfully avoids terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Area for Improvement:** The primary deviation from the instructions is the failure to describe the overlay subtitles present in the video.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is of high quality, providing a clear, accurate, and objective description of the scene. It demonstrates a strong understanding of most of the instructions. The only significant improvement needed is to include a description of the on-screen subtitles to be fully compliant with the provided guidelines.",
