    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor setting with a dimly lit, minimalist environment. A long, dark table extends across the scene, surrounded by a row of identical chairs. Seated at the table are multiple figures, all wearing similar attire, facing away from the viewer. The lighting is subdued, casting soft shadows and creating a reflective surface on the floor, enhancing the room's sleek and modern aesthetic. The atmosphere is calm and still, with no visible movement or activity. Overlays include a small text element in the bottom left corner, which is not part of the scene itself.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on the caption. It is well-written, concise, and accurately captures the main visual elements of the scene while adhering to most of the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   **Mostly Accurate:** The description of the indoor setting, minimalist environment, table, chairs, figures, and lighting is precise.\n*   **Minor Inaccuracy:** The caption states there is \"no visible movement or activity.\" However, the figures are not completely static; they make subtle movements, such as shifting in their seats and gesturing slightly. A more accurate description would acknowledge this subtle motion.\n\n### Completeness\n*   **Very Complete:** The caption effectively covers the key aspects of the scene, including the setting, props (table, chairs), subjects, lighting, and the reflective floor.\n*   **Minor Omission:** The caption does not specify the point of view, which is a static, eye-level shot. While not a major issue, including this would add another layer of detail.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n*   **Excellent Adherence:** The caption successfully follows most of the negative constraints: it avoids speculative language, emotional adjectives, inferring the scene's purpose, and using forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame.\" It correctly identifies the text as an overlay.\n*   **Area for Improvement:** The instruction to \"describe motion or changes\" was not fully met due to the inaccurate statement about the lack of movement. The description of the aesthetic as \"sleek and modern\" leans slightly subjective but is acceptable as it describes the overall style of the scene.\n\n### Overall Assessment\nThe caption is very strong and provides a clear, objective description of the video. The only significant point of improvement is to accurately describe the subtle movements of the figures instead of stating there are none. Otherwise, it is an excellent example of following the provided guidelines.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a static, eye-level perspective, the video shows a dimly lit, minimalist indoor setting. A long, dark table extends across the scene, with a row of identical chairs lined up behind it. Multiple figures, all wearing similar attire, are seated at the table with their backs to the viewer. The figures are not entirely still; they make subtle, asynchronous movements, such as shifting in their seats and gesturing slightly. The scene is illuminated by a soft, focused light, casting long shadows. The dark, polished floor creates a clear reflection of the figures and chairs. A small text element appears as an overlay in the bottom left corner.",
