    "pre_caption": "The video presents a first-person POV shot set indoors, featuring a modern, high-tech environment. A large, transparent screen displays a video call interface with a circular view of an outdoor urban setting, showing buildings and a clear sky. The time of day appears to be daytime, with bright natural light illuminating the scene. The screen also includes a smaller circular inset showing another person, suggesting a conversation. The setting is sleek and futuristic, with a focus on digital communication technology.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains several inaccuracies and omits key details. The description of \"floor-to-ceiling windows\" is an assumption, as the full height of the window is not visible; it should be described as \"a large window.\" The statement that the screen \"includes a smaller circular inset showing another person\" is factually incorrect, as only one person is visible on the screen. The \"low shelving unit on the left side\" is a misidentification of the desk surface. The caption also violates instructions by using the speculative phrase \"appears to be\" and the interpretive phrase \"emphasizing digital communication technology.\" Furthermore, the caption omits the prominent action of a first-person hand plugging a device into one of the glowing ports on the screen's cylindrical base, a key interaction within the scene.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A first-person point-of-view shot shows a hand interacting with a futuristic, transparent screen on a desk in a modern room with a large window. The screen displays a video call with a man's face inside a glowing, bubble-like circle, set against a blurred urban background. The man is speaking directly to the camera. The first-person hand reaches out and plugs a small, white device into a port on the screen's cylindrical base, which glows with a pink light. There are other glowing blue and white ports on the base as well.",
