    "pre_caption": "A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character’s eyes, begins indoors at the Higashiyama Zoo and Botanical Gardens, where a large, glossy informational display is mounted on a wall. The display features a green and white color scheme with Japanese and English text, a timeline, elephant icons, and photographs of elephants, all protected by a reflective surface. The video then transitions outdoors to a covered walkway overlooking an elephant enclosure. The setting is open-air, with a view of sandy ground, large rocks, and multiple tall, cylindrical columns in a pale orange color supporting the structure. The enclosure is bordered by metal railings and fencing, with sparse greenery and a few trees visible in the background under a cloudy sky. The overall environment is clean and well-maintained, with the architecture blending concrete and natural elements.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is mostly accurate and well-structured, but it omits several notable elements visible in the video. The indoor segment includes not only the large informational display but also additional panels with photographs and text, a display case with objects, and a monitor showing historical footage, all of which help establish the environment as an exhibit area. The walls and ceiling are painted in warm beige and brown tones, with visible lighting fixtures and some wood-textured columns, which should be mentioned to better convey the architectural style. The transition to the outdoor area is a smooth pan rather than a hard cut, and the walkway is partially enclosed, not fully open-air, with large windows and metal railings separating the viewing area from the elephant enclosure. The outdoor environment features a sandy ground, large rocks, sparse greenery, and tall, cylindrical columns in a pale orange color, as described, but the sky is bright and overcast rather than clearly cloudy. The caption should also note the presence of a few people in the background, as their placement provides context without excessive detail. There are no overlay elements such as text or icons on the video itself, so that part of the instruction is not relevant here. To improve the caption, include the additional indoor exhibit features, clarify the architectural details and lighting, specify the type of transition, and mention the presence of people in the background.",
