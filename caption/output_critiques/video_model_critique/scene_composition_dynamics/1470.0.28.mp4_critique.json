    "pre_caption": "The video is set in a cozy, softly lit bathroom with a vintage aesthetic. The room features a freestanding bathtub with claw feet, filled with bubbles. A window with partially closed blinds allows sunlight to filter in, casting patterned shadows on the walls. The walls are painted in a muted tone, complementing the warm wooden floor. A radiator is positioned beneath the window, and a towel hangs on a nearby rack. A small shelf holds toiletries, and a pair of slippers is placed on the floor. The overall atmosphere is serene and intimate, with a focus on the interplay of light and shadow.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good for this video.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n- The description of the lighting as \"softly lit\" is inaccurate. The scene features strong, high-contrast lighting from the window, creating distinct, hard-edged shadows, not soft light.\n- The radiator is described as being \"beneath the window,\" but it is actually to the right of the bathtub.\n\n**Completeness:**\n- The caption completely omits the two people in the bathtub, who are the central subjects of the scene. The instructions state to include subjects and their context, and their absence makes the description fundamentally incomplete.\n- It fails to mention other significant features that define the space, such as the sloped, attic-like ceiling, the toilet on the left, and the cushioned bench on the right.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n- **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":** The caption uses subjective words like \"cozy,\" \"serene,\" and \"intimate,\" which are explicitly forbidden.\n- **Violation of \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights\":** The phrase \"with a focus on the interplay of light and shadow\" is an interpretation of the scene's artistic intent, which the instructions prohibit.\n- **Violation of \"If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene\":** By omitting the subjects entirely, the caption fails to follow this instruction.\n- **Violation of \"indicate the point of view\":** The caption does not mention the static, eye-level point of view.\n\nIn summary, the caption is inaccurate in its description of the lighting, incomplete by omitting the main subjects and other key environmental details, and it violates several core negative constraints by using subjective language and interpreting the scene's focus.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A static, eye-level medium shot shows two people in a bathtub in a bathroom with a sloped attic ceiling. The person on the left stands in the bubble-filled tub, fully dressed in a white short-sleeved shirt and a dark tie, with shaving cream on their face, holding a small book. The person on the right lies back in the bubbles, wearing a pink hair wrap and a face mask. Bright light from a window with horizontal blinds behind them creates high-contrast, linear shadows across the room. To the left of the white claw-foot tub is a toilet. To the right is a vertical radiator and a cushioned bench.",
