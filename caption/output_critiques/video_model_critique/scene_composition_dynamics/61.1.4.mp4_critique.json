    "pre_caption": "The video presents an indoor setting with an over-the-shoulder point of view, focusing on a character seated in a dimly lit room. The environment suggests a cozy, intimate space, possibly a café or a small restaurant, with warm lighting casting soft shadows. The character is positioned at a table, with a visible upper body, wearing a light-colored shirt. The background features blurred elements, including a red light and patterned upholstery, contributing to a relaxed, informal atmosphere. The time of day is indeterminate due to the indoor setting, but the lighting suggests an evening or nighttime ambiance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind the character, showing their upper body and the scene ahead.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good. It violates several key instructions, including the prohibitions on using subjective language, making speculative statements, and interpreting the scene's mood.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description of \"patterned upholstery\" in the background is slightly misleading. The most prominent upholstery is the red booth the character is sitting in, which is in the foreground and midground, not just the background.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption misses some notable visual details, such as the distinct green and red color palette of the lighting and the specific type of furniture (a red booth, characteristic of a diner or bar).\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":** The caption uses subjective words like \"cozy,\" \"intimate,\" \"relaxed,\" and \"informal.\" These terms describe a feeling or mood rather than objective visual facts.\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid speculative statements\":** The caption includes phrases like \"possibly a café or a small restaurant\" and \"the lighting suggests an evening or nighttime ambiance.\" The instructions explicitly forbid speculation (\"possibly\") and ambiguous inferences (\"suggests\").\n*   **Violation of \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights\":** The phrase \"contributing to a relaxed, informal atmosphere\" is an interpretation of the scene's mood and the effect of its visual elements, which is explicitly disallowed.\n*   **Violation of \"Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions\":** While the subject description is brief, the caption could have provided more detail about the setting itself (e.g., the red booth, the specific colors of the lights) instead of focusing on the character's placement.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "An over-the-shoulder shot shows an indoor location where a person is seated in a red booth. The scene is dimly lit, with prominent green and red lights visible in the foreground and background. The background is out of focus, showing the back of another person. The person in the foreground is visible from the chest up, wearing a light-colored, short-sleeved collared shirt.",
