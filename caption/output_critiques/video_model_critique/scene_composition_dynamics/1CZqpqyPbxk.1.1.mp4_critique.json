    "pre_caption": "The video shows a recording of a computer screen with visible UI elements, likely from video editing software. The interface includes various controls and color grading tools, such as color wheels and scopes, displayed prominently at the bottom. The main section features a video clip with a green tint, possibly night vision, showing a person holding a camera. The environment is indoors, with the software interface providing a structured and technical setting. The overall color scheme is dark, with the green-tinted video clip contrasting against the darker interface. The time of day is not specified, but the screen's brightness and the software's dark theme suggest a focus on clarity and detail.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**This is a recording of a computer screen with visible UI elements.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\n### Feedback:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is generally accurate in its description of the visual elements (software interface, color wheels, green-tinted video). However, it misidentifies the setting.\n*   **Completeness:** The description is reasonably complete, covering the main components of the screen. It could be more specific by naming the software, which is clearly visible as \"DaVinci Resolve.\"\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Setting:** The instruction requires a clear identification of the setting. The caption incorrectly states the environment is \"indoors,\" which is an assumption about the physical location of the computer. The actual setting shown is a digital one: the interface of video editing software.\n    *   **Speculation:** The caption violates the instruction to avoid speculative statements by using \"likely from video editing software\" and \"possibly night vision.\" The software is identifiable, and the effect can be described without speculation.\n    *   **Interpretation:** The caption violates the instruction to avoid interpretation by stating that the dark theme \"suggests a focus on clarity and detail.\"\n    *   **Point of View:** The caption correctly identifies the content as a \"recording of a computer screen\" but doesn't frame this as the point of view, which is a fixed shot of a digital interface.\n    *   **Overlays:** The caption correctly identifies the UI elements but could be clearer that the entire view is a software interface, which acts as a frame for the video clip being edited.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A screen recording captures the interface of the DaVinci Resolve video editing software, which constitutes the digital setting for the video. In the central viewer, a video clip shows a person in profile holding a camera to their eye. The clip has been color-graded with a strong green tint to create a night-vision effect. The software's dark-themed UI frames the video clip, with various panels visible. Below the viewer are the \"Color Wheels\" for Lift, Gamma, Gain, and Offset, and a \"Scopes\" panel displaying a green waveform graph. To the upper right, a node editor shows two connected nodes, illustrating the video's processing workflow.",
