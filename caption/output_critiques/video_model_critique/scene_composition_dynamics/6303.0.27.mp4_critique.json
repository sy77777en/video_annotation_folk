    "pre_caption": "The video captures an outdoor basketball court during the day, surrounded by urban elements. The court's surface is a textured red material, and a basketball with a unique face design is prominently placed in the foreground. In the background, a group of people is engaged in a game, with their movements adding dynamic energy to the scene. The surrounding environment includes graffiti-covered walls and nearby buildings, indicating an urban setting. The sky is clear with a few clouds, suggesting fair weather. Trees with autumn foliage add a touch of natural color to the otherwise urban landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption omits the distinct low-angle point of view, which is a key element of the scene's composition. The description of the basketball's \"unique face design\" could be more specific, for example, by describing it as a \"sculpted human face.\" The phrase \"with their movements adding dynamic energy to the scene\" is subjective; a more objective description would be to state that the people are in motion or that their figures are blurred by movement. Additionally, the phrase \"indicating an urban setting\" is redundant, as the presence of graffiti and buildings already establishes this context.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "Shot from a low-angle perspective on an outdoor basketball court, the scene focuses on a basketball with a sculpted human face resting in the foreground on the textured red surface. In the background, the figures of several people engaged in a game are blurred by motion. The court is surrounded by a graffiti-covered wall and apartment buildings, with trees showing autumn foliage under a partly cloudy sky.",
