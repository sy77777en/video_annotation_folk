    "pre_caption": "The video, captured from a drone POV, showcases a lush, outdoor setting featuring a waterfall cascading into a small pool surrounded by dense greenery. The scene is set during the day, with natural light illuminating the vibrant green foliage and the rocky terrain. The waterfall, with its clear, flowing water, creates a dynamic element against the earthy tones of the rocks. The surrounding forest is dense with various trees and plants, adding texture and depth to the landscape. The area around the pool is dotted with rocks and patches of grass, providing a natural, serene environment. The drone's perspective offers a sweeping view of the scene, highlighting the waterfall's height and the expansive greenery enveloping the area.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A video filmed by a drone.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good for this video. While it captures the general essence of the scene, it violates several key instructions and contains inaccuracies.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption describes the waterfall's water as \"clear,\" which is inaccurate. The water in the plunge pool is visibly brown and murky, likely due to sediment. The falling water itself is white and aerated, not transparently clear.\n*   It fails to mention a significant feature: the waterfall is composed of two distinct, separate streams falling side-by-side.\n*   It omits the presence of the few people standing near the edge of the pool, which are a visible element in the scene.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is incomplete because it misses the key details mentioned above (the double-stream waterfall, the color of the pool water, and the people). Including these would provide a more thorough description of the scene.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":** The caption uses the word \"serene,\" which is a subjective and emotional descriptor.\n*   **Violation of \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights\":** The final sentence explicitly states that the drone's perspective is \"highlighting the waterfall's height and the expansive greenery.\" This directly contravenes the instruction.\n*   **Borderline Violation:** The phrase \"creates a dynamic element\" is interpretive rather than purely descriptive. While less severe, it leans towards explaining the effect of an element rather than just describing the element itself.\n\nIn summary, the caption fails because it includes inaccuracies, omits key visual information, and directly violates at least two negative constraints from the instructions (no subjective words, no explaining emphasis).",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "An aerial, eye-level shot shows a waterfall composed of two separate streams of white water. The streams fall from a rock ledge down a reddish-brown cliff face into a round pool of brown water at the bottom. The waterfall is set in a cove surrounded by steep, tree-covered banks and dense green foliage. On the rocky and grassy shore of the pool, a few people are standing. The video is shot during the day.",
