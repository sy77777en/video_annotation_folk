    "pre_caption": "The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, descending into an underground setting. The environment is outdoors initially, transitioning to an indoor space. The scene begins with a view of a concrete staircase flanked by rough, textured stone walls leading downwards. The time of day is not clearly defined due to the enclosed nature of the setting. The concrete walls are weathered, with visible cracks and patches of moss, indicating age and exposure to the elements. As the descent continues, the setting shifts to an interior space with a large, metallic door at the bottom, featuring geometric patterns and red star markings. The lighting is dim, casting shadows that enhance the enclosed, bunker-like atmosphere. The overall scene conveys a sense of exploration into a hidden or restricted area.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good for this video. It contains significant inaccuracies and fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **Point of View:** The caption incorrectly identifies the shot as \"first-person POV.\" The camera is positioned behind two individuals, capturing them as they walk, which is a third-person perspective or a following shot, not a view from a character's eyes.\n*   **Setting Transition:** The statement that the environment is \"outdoors initially, transitioning to an indoor space\" is misleading. The entire scene takes place within a single, open-air, man-made structure that leads underground. It is not a transition from a general outdoor area to a separate indoor one.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Avoid Inference:** The caption violates the instruction \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting\" by describing a \"bunker-like atmosphere.\" While the visual evidence suggests this, the instruction requires describing only what is seen, not interpreting the location's purpose.\n*   **Avoid Subjectivity and Explanations:** The caption fails to follow the instructions \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\" and \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\" The final sentence, \"The overall scene conveys a sense of exploration into a hidden or restricted area,\" is a subjective interpretation of the mood and narrative, which is explicitly forbidden.\n\n**Completeness and Style:**\n*   The description of the physical elements—such as the \"rough, textured stone walls,\" \"patches of moss,\" and the \"large, metallic door... featuring geometric patterns and red star markings\"—is accurate and well-detailed. However, these correct details are undermined by the fundamental errors in POV and the violation of negative constraints.\n\nIn summary, the caption is not good because it misidentifies the point of view and includes subjective interpretations and inferences about the setting's role and atmosphere, directly contradicting the instructions provided.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A high-angle, wide shot follows two men as they walk down a passage constructed from large, rough-textured concrete or stone blocks. The walls and ceiling are weathered, with visible cracks and patches of green moss. The man in front wears an orange t-shirt and a blue backpack, while the man behind him wears a blue and white hooded jacket. They descend towards a large, dark metal double door set into the wall at the end of the passage. The door features a geometric pattern of raised lines and two small, red star emblems. The area is lit by daylight from above, with the space around the door in shadow.",
