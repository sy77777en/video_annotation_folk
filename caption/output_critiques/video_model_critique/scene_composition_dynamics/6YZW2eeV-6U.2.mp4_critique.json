    "pre_caption": "The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, descending into an underground setting. The environment is outdoors initially, transitioning to an indoor space. The scene begins with a view of a concrete staircase flanked by rough, textured stone walls leading downwards. The time of day is not clearly defined due to the enclosed nature of the setting. The concrete walls are weathered, with visible cracks and patches of moss, indicating age and exposure to the elements. As the descent continues, the setting shifts to an interior space with a large, metallic door at the bottom, featuring geometric patterns and red star markings. The lighting is dim, casting shadows that enhance the enclosed, bunker-like atmosphere. The overall scene conveys a sense of exploration into a hidden or restricted area.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains several inaccuracies and violations of the instructions. The point of view is not strictly \"first-person,\" as another person is visible standing next to the camera's position; it is a handheld shot moving forward. The description of a \"concrete staircase\" is incorrect, as the characters are walking down a sloped floor or ramp. The caption uses speculative language such as \"appears to be\" and \"likely,\" which is explicitly forbidden. The final two sentences (\"The lighting is dim... a hidden or restricted area.\") are entirely subjective and interpretive, inferring the setting's atmosphere and purpose (\"bunker-like atmosphere,\" \"sense of exploration\"), which violates the instructions. The phrase \"the setting shifts\" is also misleading, as the camera moves continuously within a single space. The caption should be rewritten to describe the scene factually: a handheld shot moves down a passage with rough-textured walls and a concrete ceiling, lit by bright daylight from behind. The passage leads to a large, gray metal double door marked with geometric patterns and two small red stars. Two men are present, one walking toward the door and another standing to the right.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A handheld camera shot moves forward and down a sloped passage with rough-textured, light-colored stone walls and a concrete ceiling. The passage is lit by daylight from behind the camera. At the end of the passage is a large, gray metal double door with a geometric pattern of raised lines and two small red stars. Two men are in the passage. One, wearing an orange shirt and a blue backpack, walks down the slope toward the door. The other, wearing a blue and white jacket, stands on the right, looking toward the door.",
