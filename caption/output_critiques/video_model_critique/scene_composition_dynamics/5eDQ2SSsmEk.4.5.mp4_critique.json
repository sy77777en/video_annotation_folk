    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor setting with a dimly lit, industrial atmosphere. The environment features a rough, dusty surface in the foreground, possibly a workbench or floor, with a metallic screw prominently placed on it. The background is blurred, suggesting a spacious area with indistinct structures, possibly machinery or tools, contributing to the industrial feel. The lighting is low, casting shadows and creating a moody ambiance. The scene transitions subtly, with the screw appearing more prominently in the latter part, indicating a slight change in focus or perspective. The overall color palette is muted, with shades of gray and brown dominating the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is missing a key visual element and contains speculative language. It fails to mention the screwdriver with a translucent, amber-colored handle that the hand is holding. The use of \"possibly\" in the phrases \"possibly a workbench or floor\" and \"possibly machinery or tools\" violates the instruction to avoid speculative statements. Additionally, the phrase \"contributing to the industrial feel\" is an inference and should be removed. The description should be revised to include the screwdriver and remove the speculative wording, for instance, by simply stating \"a rough, dusty surface\" and \"indistinct structures in the background.\"",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video is a close-up shot in a dimly lit, industrial-style setting. A hand holds a screwdriver with a translucent, amber-colored handle and places a metallic screw onto a rough, dusty surface in the foreground. The hand and screwdriver then move out of the frame, leaving the screw standing upright. The background is blurred, revealing indistinct structures and circular bokeh lights. The low lighting creates a moody ambiance with deep shadows, and the overall color palette is muted, with shades of gray and brown.",
