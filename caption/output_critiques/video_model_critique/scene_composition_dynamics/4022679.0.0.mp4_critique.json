    "pre_caption": "An outdoor scene is set during the day, featuring a man in a denim jacket standing on a dark, paved surface. A tall, silver chain-link fence is positioned directly behind him, separating the foreground from the background. Through the diamond-patterned mesh of the fence, the out-of-focus shapes of a building and trees are visible.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good for this video.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the scene as outdoors during the day, the subject as a man in a denim jacket, and the ground as a dark, paved surface. The description of the \"tall, silver chain-link fence\" with its \"diamond-patterned mesh\" and the \"out-of-focus shapes of a building and trees\" in the background is precise and true to the visual information.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption provides a complete overview of the scene's essential elements. It covers the setting, time of day, the primary subject's context, and the most prominent features of the environment (the fence and the background), fulfilling the requirement for a concise yet informative description.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption excels at following the specific instructions:\n*   **Focus on Setting:** It dedicates significant detail to the fence and background, correctly prioritizing the setting over the subject.\n*   **Objective Language:** It uses simple, neutral language (\"dark, paved surface,\" \"silver chain-link fence\") and avoids emotional or subjective adjectives.\n*   **No Speculation:** It correctly describes the ground as a \"paved surface\" without speculating that it might be a basketball or tennis court.\n*   **Conciseness:** The description is delivered in a single, clear, and coherent paragraph.\n*   **Formatting:** It returns only the description without any introductory text or markdown.\n*   **No Frame References:** It describes the scene holistically without mentioning specific frames or using terms like \"image.\"",
