    "pre_caption": "The video takes place outdoors on a rural road under a bright blue sky scattered with large, white clouds. The road is paved and curves gently, bordered by patches of green grass and low vegetation on both sides. On the right, a low stone wall and a white metal gate mark the entrance to a property with a small building, while a cross-shaped metal structure rises above the wall. Further along, a yellow triangular road sign with a red border is mounted on a post near the wall. In the distance, a few houses with red roofs are visible, surrounded by trees and shrubs. The scene includes a black car moving across an intersection where the road splits, with the car’s dark, glossy surface reflecting sunlight. The overall environment is quiet and open, with no overlays or text present in the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is mostly accurate and follows the instruction well, providing a clear description of the outdoor rural road, the bright sky, the road’s features, and the notable elements such as the stone wall, metal gate, cross-shaped structure, road sign, and distant houses. However, there are a few inaccuracies and missing details: the caption mentions a black car moving across an intersection, but in the video, the car is a dark pickup truck, and its movement is more specifically a left turn at the split rather than simply \"moving across an intersection.\" The caption also omits the presence of yellow speed bumps painted on the road near the intersection, which are a notable visual element. The point of view, which is a forward-facing, ground-level perspective (likely from a moving vehicle or person), should be explicitly stated as it influences the viewer’s perception. The caption could also mention the presence of pink flowers and green foliage on the right side near the blue building, which add to the scene’s distinguishing features. There are no overlays or text, which is correctly noted. To improve, specify the point of view, correct the vehicle description and its movement, add the yellow speed bumps, and mention the flowers and foliage for a more complete and precise caption.",
