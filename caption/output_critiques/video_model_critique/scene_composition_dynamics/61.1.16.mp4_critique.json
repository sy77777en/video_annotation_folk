    "pre_caption": "The video presents a first-person POV shot inside a retro-style diner. The setting features red vinyl booth seating and wooden tables, creating a classic American diner atmosphere. The lighting is warm and slightly dim, suggesting an evening or nighttime setting. The tables are adorned with typical diner items like condiment bottles and paper napkins. The environment is lively, with patrons engaged in conversation, adding to the bustling ambiance. The scene captures the essence of a cozy, nostalgic diner experience.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good because it violates several key instructions.\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description of the physical setting (first-person POV, retro diner, red booths, wooden tables, dim lighting) is accurate. However, the description of the patrons' activity as being \"engaged in conversation\" is not entirely correct; they are actively looking at and reacting to the camera.\n*   **Completeness:** The caption covers the main elements of the scene but omits details like the tiled floor and the specific food items on the tables (fries, a sundae). It also fails to mention the hand that enters the frame from the first-person perspective.\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption fails to adhere to several negative constraints:\n    *   **Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives:** The caption uses multiple subjective words, such as \"lively,\" \"bustling,\" \"cozy,\" and \"nostalgic.\"\n    *   **Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights:** The final sentence, \"The scene captures the essence of a cozy, nostalgic diner experience,\" is a direct violation of this rule, as it interprets the meaning and feeling of the scene rather than describing its visual content.\n    *   **Do not infer the role of the scene setting:** The phrase \"creating a classic American diner atmosphere\" is an inference about the setting's role and effect.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A first-person point-of-view shot moves through a diner with a green and white tiled floor. The diner is furnished with red vinyl booths and wooden tables under dim, warm lighting. Three women are seated in separate booths. They look toward the camera as it passes; one holds up a phone and makes a peace sign, while another smiles. On the tables are baskets of fries, drinks, a sundae, and condiment bottles. A hand with a red bracelet enters the frame from the bottom left and makes a gesture.",
