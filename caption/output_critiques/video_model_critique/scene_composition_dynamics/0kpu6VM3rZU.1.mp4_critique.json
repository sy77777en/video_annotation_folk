    "pre_caption": "The video captures a lively outdoor event, likely a red carpet gathering, set in an urban environment. The scene is viewed from a broadcast POV shot, typical of television production, providing a clear and structured view of the event. It takes place during the evening, as indicated by the artificial lighting illuminating the area. The background features a large building with distinctive red and white circular patterns, possibly part of a commercial or entertainment complex. The setting is bustling with elegantly dressed attendees, suggesting a formal occasion. Notable visual elements include a prominent red carpet and a backdrop with reflective surfaces, adding to the glamorous atmosphere. Overlays are present, including a logo and text identifying the broadcast network, positioned at the bottom left corner of the screen.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A broadcast POV shot where the camera is set up for television production.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good. While it correctly identifies some elements, it violates several core instructions, making it unsuitable.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy and Completeness:**\n*   The caption is inaccurate in describing the background as a \"large building.\" The structure appears to be a large, temporary tent or enclosure, not a permanent building.\n*   It omits a very notable visual element: the large, clear, multifaceted award being held by the woman in the foreground.\n*   Describing the setting as \"outdoor\" is technically correct, but \"under a large tent at an outdoor event\" would be more precise.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid speculative statements\":** The caption uses speculative and inferential language multiple times, such as \"**likely** a red carpet gathering,\" \"**possibly** part of a commercial or entertainment complex,\" and \"**suggesting** a formal occasion.\" The presence of a red carpet makes it a red carpet gathering, not \"likely.\"\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain\":** It assumes the event is in an \"**urban environment**\" and is part of a \"**commercial or entertainment complex**,\" neither of which can be confirmed from the visual information provided.\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":** The phrase \"**glamorous atmosphere**\" is a subjective interpretation of the scene's mood.\n*   **Violation of \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights\":** The caption explains the effect of the POV (\"**providing a clear and structured view**\") and explains how the time of day is known (\"**as indicated by the artificial lighting**\") instead of simply describing the scene.\n*   **Violation of \"Focus on the setting and scenery\":** While it describes the setting, it misses a key prop (the award) that is a central part of the visual information.\n\nIn summary, the caption fails because it is speculative, subjective, and explanatory rather than purely descriptive. It also contains an inaccuracy about the setting and omits a key visual detail.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A woman in a dark, metallic-sheen dress is being interviewed on a red carpet. She holds a large, clear, multifaceted award in one hand while gesturing with the other. The interviewer holds a microphone with \"ET\" logos towards her. The event takes place at night under a large tent, which is crowded with people in formal attire. The interior of the tent has a ceiling decorated with large red and white circular patterns. In the bottom-left corner, there is an on-screen graphic with the \"ET CANADA\" logo. The shot is a medium close-up from a broadcast perspective.",
