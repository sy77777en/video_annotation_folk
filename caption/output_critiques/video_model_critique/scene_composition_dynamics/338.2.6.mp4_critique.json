    "pre_caption": "The video is set indoors in a dimly lit restaurant with a warm, intimate atmosphere. The setting features a table with a white tablecloth, where a plate of noodles and a glass of iced tea are prominently placed. The restaurant's interior includes red-cushioned chairs and ornate ceiling details, contributing to a classic, cozy ambiance. The lighting is soft, casting gentle shadows and highlighting the rich colors of the food and surroundings. The scene remains consistent throughout, maintaining a focus on the dining experience within this inviting environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption.\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is accurate in its description of the physical environment. It correctly identifies the setting as a dimly lit indoor restaurant, and accurately describes the table setting (white tablecloth, plate of noodles, glass), the chairs (red-cushioned), and the ceiling (ornate).\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is incomplete. It omits two key visual elements present in the video:\n1.  **Subject:** The caption fails to mention the man sitting at the table, who is the central figure in the scene. The instructions state, \"If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail,\" implying they should be included for context.\n2.  **Overlay:** The caption completely misses the subtitle overlay at the bottom of the screen that reads \"self-service.\" The instructions specifically require the description of any overlay elements, including their content and placement.\n\n**Adherence to the Given Instruction:**\nThe caption fails to adhere to several key instructions:\n\n*   **Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives:** The caption violates this rule by using words like \"warm, intimate atmosphere,\" \"classic, cozy ambiance,\" and \"inviting environment.\" These terms are subjective interpretations of the scene's mood rather than objective descriptions.\n*   **Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights:** The phrase \"maintaining a focus on the dining experience\" is an interpretation of the scene's purpose and violates this instruction.\n*   **Describe overlay elements:** As mentioned under \"Completeness,\" the caption fails to describe the subtitle overlay, which is a mandatory part of the description according to the instructions.\n*   **Subject inclusion:** By omitting the person, the caption provides an incomplete picture of the scene's composition, failing to place the subject in context as requested.\n\nIn summary, while the caption correctly describes some aspects of the setting, it is inaccurate due to significant omissions and fails to follow several negative constraints and positive requirements outlined in the instructions, particularly regarding subjectivity, overlays, and the inclusion of the main subject for context.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A low-angle, centered shot shows an elderly man in a dimly lit restaurant. He wears glasses and a maroon, short-sleeved collared shirt. He is seated at a table with a white tablecloth, using chopsticks to eat from a plate of noodles. A glass with an amber-colored liquid is also on the table. In the background, other tables, red-cushioned chairs, and an ornate ceiling are visible. At the bottom of the screen, a white subtitle reads, \"self-service.\"",
