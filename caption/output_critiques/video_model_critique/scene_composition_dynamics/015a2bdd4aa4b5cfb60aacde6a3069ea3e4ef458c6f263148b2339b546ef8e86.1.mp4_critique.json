    "pre_caption": "The video, captured from a drone POV, showcases a scenic coastal landscape. It features a small, rocky peninsula jutting into a deep blue sea, surrounded by clear waters with visible underwater formations. The peninsula is covered with lush green vegetation and houses a solitary, modest building with a light-colored roof, blending naturally with the environment. The coastline is rugged, with steep cliffs and a backdrop of distant hills under a clear sky, suggesting a calm, sunny day. The expansive view highlights the natural beauty and isolation of the setting, with a few boats dotting the horizon, adding a sense of scale and tranquility to the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A video filmed by a drone.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe caption is good but not perfect. It successfully captures the main essence of the scene with accurate descriptions of the environment and key elements. However, it violates a few key negative constraints, particularly regarding subjectivity and interpretation, and misses one aspect of the scene's motion.\n\n**Feedback Breakdown:**\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description is highly accurate. The scene is indeed a drone shot of a coastal landscape with a rocky peninsula, a single building, clear blue and turquoise water, and distant hills. The description of the building as having a \"light-colored roof\" is correct, though it could be more specific (it appears to be terracotta or orange).\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is mostly complete. It covers the point of view, setting, time of day, and the most prominent visual elements (peninsula, sea, building, boats, cliffs). However, it fails to mention the subtle motion in the video—the slow, continuous rotation of the drone to the right, which gradually reveals more of the coastline.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Strengths:**\n        *   It correctly identifies the **point of view** as a \"drone POV.\"\n        *   It provides a clear description of the **setting** and **environment**.\n        *   It correctly identifies the **time of day** (\"calm, sunny day\").\n        *   It avoids using forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n        *   It is structured as a single, coherent paragraph.\n\n    *   **Weaknesses (Violations of Instructions):**\n        *   **Violation:** \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\"\n            *   The caption uses words like \"scenic,\" \"lush,\" \"modest,\" \"natural beauty,\" and \"tranquility.\" These are subjective and interpretative.\n        *   **Violation:** \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\"\n            *   The last sentence explicitly does this: \"The expansive view **highlights** the natural beauty and isolation of the setting...\"\n        *   **Violation:** \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting.\"\n            *   The phrase \"...adding a sense of scale and tranquility to the scene\" infers the purpose and effect of the visual elements, which goes against the instruction to stick to objective description.\n        *   **Violation:** \"Avoid speculative statements...\"\n            *   \"...suggesting a calm, sunny day\" is a minor inference, but it's based on strong visual evidence and is generally acceptable. However, the other violations are more significant.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "An aerial video, captured from a drone's point of view, slowly rotates to the right over a coastal landscape. The scene centers on a rocky peninsula covered with green vegetation that extends into a deep blue sea. A single building with white walls and an orange tile roof sits near the tip of the peninsula, which is lined with steep, light-colored rock cliffs. The water immediately surrounding the land is a clear, turquoise color, revealing submerged rocks, while the open sea is a darker blue. In the distance, a larger coastline with green hills is visible, and several small boats are scattered across the water's surface under a clear sky.",
