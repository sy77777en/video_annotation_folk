    "pre_caption": "The scene is set indoors with a dimly lit environment, creating a subdued and intimate atmosphere. The background is dark, providing a stark contrast to the subject, who is positioned centrally. The subject has a relaxed posture, with eyes closed, suggesting a moment of calm or introspection. The lighting softly highlights the subject's features, emphasizing the smooth texture of the skin and the subtle sheen on the lips. The overall color palette is warm and muted, with the subject's attire blending seamlessly into the low-light setting. The focus remains on the subject, with no other visible elements or distractions in the environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback on the caption is as follows:\nThe caption incorrectly uses subjective and emotional language such as \"subdued and intimate atmosphere,\" \"relaxed posture,\" and \"moment of calm or introspection,\" which is explicitly forbidden by the instructions. It also speculates on the subject's state (\"suggesting a moment of calm or introspection\") and explains the scene's emphasis (\"emphasizing the smooth texture of the skin\"), both of which are violations. Furthermore, the caption omits a key visual element: the black framing overlay with rounded corners that gives the video a vintage aesthetic. It also fails to mention the single tear visible on the subject's cheek. To improve, all subjective, speculative, and explanatory phrases should be removed. The description should be revised to include the black framing overlay and the tear, focusing only on observable facts within the dimly lit, dark indoor setting.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The shot is presented within a black frame with rounded corners. In a dimly lit indoor setting with a dark background, a person is positioned in the center. They have dark, wavy hair and are wearing a strapless black top. Their head is tilted to the side with their eyes closed, and a single tear is visible on their cheek. The lighting highlights the subject, and the overall color palette is muted.",
