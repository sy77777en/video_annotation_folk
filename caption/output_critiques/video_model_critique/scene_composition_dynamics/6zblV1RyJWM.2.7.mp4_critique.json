    "pre_caption": "The video presents a third-person over-the-hip POV shot showing a character from waist height in an outdoor desert setting during twilight. The environment features a rugged landscape with distant mountains silhouetted against a dim sky. A white pickup truck with rooftop tents is parked on uneven terrain, accompanied by a folding table with camping gear. The truck's metallic surface contrasts with the dark surroundings, while the table holds items like a lantern and cooking equipment. The scene is characterized by the soft, muted colors of dusk, with shadows cast by the low light. The overall atmosphere is calm and still, with no visible movement or weather effects.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A third-person over-the-hip POV shot showing a character from waist height**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is good, but it has a few minor issues that prevent it from perfectly adhering to the instructions.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the point of view, the outdoor desert setting, the time of day (twilight), and all the key objects in the scene, including the white pickup truck, rooftop tents, folding table, and the silhouetted character.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe description is very complete. It covers the environment, notable objects, lighting, and lack of motion as instructed. It successfully combines all visual details into a single, coherent paragraph.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption follows most of the instructions well, but there are a few specific violations:\n\n*   **Violation (Subjective Adjectives):** The instruction states, \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The caption uses \"soft\" to describe the colors and \"calm\" to describe the atmosphere. These words interpret the mood of the scene rather than describing it objectively. A more neutral word like \"still\" is a better fit than \"calm.\"\n*   **Violation (Speculation):** The instruction says, \"Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain.\" The caption mentions the table holds \"cooking equipment.\" While this is a reasonable assumption in a camping context, the items on the table are not distinct enough to be identified as such. The more general term \"camping gear,\" used in the previous sentence, is more appropriate and less speculative.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is very well-written and provides an excellent, detailed description of the scene. However, to be perfect according to the strict rules provided, it should remove the subjective adjectives (\"soft,\" \"calm\") and the speculative detail (\"cooking equipment\").",
