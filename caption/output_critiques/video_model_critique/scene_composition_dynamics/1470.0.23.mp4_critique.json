    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor setting, likely a bedroom, with a blue carpeted floor scattered with wooden building blocks and toys. A dresser with a wooden finish is visible, along with a bed covered in a blue and white patterned blanket. The lighting suggests an artificial indoor source, creating a warm ambiance. A notable element is a human head emerging from the carpet, surrounded by debris, adding an unusual aspect to the scene. The environment is cluttered, with various objects contributing to a sense of disarray.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description of the physical scene is mostly accurate. It correctly identifies the indoor setting, the blue carpet, the wooden blocks, the dresser, and the bed with a patterned blanket.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is incomplete. It completely omits the white subtitle overlay at the bottom of the screen that reads, \"It's a\". The instructions explicitly require the description of any overlay elements.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption violates several negative constraints:\n    *   **Subjective Language:** It uses interpretive and subjective phrases like \"warm ambiance,\" \"adding an unusual aspect to the scene,\" and \"a sense of disarray.\" The instructions state to avoid emotional or subjective adjectives and to not explain what the scene emphasizes.\n    *   **Speculation:** The use of \"likely a bedroom\" is a mild form of speculation, which the instructions advise against. A more objective description would be \"an indoor room.\"\n    *   **Missing Overlays:** As mentioned, it fails to describe the subtitles, which is a direct violation of the instructions.\n\nIn summary, while the caption captures the general essence of the scene, it is not a good caption because it misses a required visual element (the overlay) and includes subjective and interpretive language, which is explicitly forbidden by the instructions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In an indoor room with a blue carpet, a human head with red hair emerges from the floor, surrounded by gray debris. The floor is scattered with wooden building blocks and other toys. In the background is a wooden dresser, and to the right is a bed with a blue and white geometric-patterned blanket. At the bottom of the screen, white text reads, \"It's a\". The scene is lit by an indoor light source.",
