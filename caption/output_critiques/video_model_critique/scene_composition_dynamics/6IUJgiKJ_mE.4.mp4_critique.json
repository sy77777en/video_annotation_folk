    "pre_caption": "The video captures an outdoor scene on a long, straight road stretching into the distance under a clear blue sky, indicating daytime. The setting is a rural area with open fields on either side, bordered by low vegetation and distant tree lines. The road is paved with a smooth surface, marked by yellow and white lines. Two cyclists are prominently featured, riding along the road, with their colorful jerseys and bicycles adding dynamic elements to the scene. Vehicles and a few people are visible in the background, suggesting a cycling event or race. The overall atmosphere is calm and expansive, with the road and landscape creating a sense of movement and progression.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good for this video.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe description of the physical scene is accurate. It correctly identifies an outdoor setting on a paved road in a rural area during the daytime, with two cyclists, other vehicles, and people present.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is incomplete because it fails to mention the point of view. The instructions explicitly state to \"indicate the point of view, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam.\" This video is clearly a tracking shot from a moving vehicle following the cyclists, which is a crucial detail for understanding the scene's perspective and motion.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption violates several key negative constraints from the instructions:\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":** The caption uses subjective phrases like \"calm and expansive\" and \"dynamic elements.\"\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid speculative statements\":** The phrase \"suggesting a cycling event or race\" is a speculative inference, which is explicitly forbidden.\n*   **Violation of \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights\":** The caption states that the scene creates \"a sense of movement and progression,\" which is an interpretation of the scene's effect on the viewer, not a neutral description of its content.\n\nIn summary, while the caption accurately describes the basic visual elements, it fails by omitting the required point of view and including forbidden subjective, speculative, and interpretive language.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A tracking shot from a moving vehicle follows two cyclists from behind as they ride on a two-lane paved road. The cyclist on the left wears a yellow and black jersey with the number 34, while the cyclist on the right wears a white and black jersey. The road is marked with yellow and white lines and is flanked by grassy and dirt shoulders. In the background, under a clear sky, are distant trees, other cyclists, and vehicles. A silver SUV is parked on the left shoulder with a few people standing beside it.",
