    "pre_caption": "The scene is set in a dark television production control room, where several people are seated at a long blue console. The console is fitted with a large mixing board featuring numerous illuminated buttons and faders. In front of them, a wall of CRT monitors displays various camera feeds. A large central monitor shows a wide view of a game show set, which has a circular stage and is lit with blue and purple lights. An adjacent large screen shows a man standing against a purple, textured background. Other smaller monitors show different angles of the production. On the desk, there are papers and a microphone. A white text overlay in the bottom left corner reads, \"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire - The Making Of Millionaire (2017)\".",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is mostly accurate but can be improved by incorporating the camera movement and adding a few omitted details. The video is not a static shot; it includes a slow pan from left to right. The caption should describe this movement. Additionally, the description of the large monitors can be more precise, and a visible clock on the wall is not mentioned.\n\nHere is a revised version for consideration:\n\nThe scene, viewed from within a dark television production control room, pans right across several people seated at a long blue console. The console is fitted with a large mixing board featuring numerous illuminated buttons and faders, with papers and a microphone on its surface. The camera movement reveals a wall of CRT monitors displaying various camera feeds. Two large, adjacent screens at the top show a wide view of a game show set with a circular, blue-and-purple-lit stage, and a man standing against a purple, textured background. Smaller monitors below show different production angles, and a clock is visible on the far wall. A white text overlay in the bottom left corner reads, \"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire - The Making Of Millionaire (2017)\".",
