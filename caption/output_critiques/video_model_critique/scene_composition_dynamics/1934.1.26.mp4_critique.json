    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor setting with a minimalist, monochromatic design. The environment is characterized by stark white walls and a clean, uncluttered space. A group of individuals dressed in white suits with orange stripes is gathered around a small, black rectangular screen embedded in the wall. One person stands out with a red top hat, adding a splash of color to the otherwise uniform scene. The individuals are positioned closely together, intently observing the screen. The setting is devoid of additional furniture or props, emphasizing the focus on the group and the screen. The lighting is bright and even, highlighting the simplicity and uniformity of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is good, but it has a minor flaw. Here is a detailed breakdown:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies all the key visual elements: the indoor setting, the minimalist and monochromatic design, the white walls, the group of individuals in white suits with orange stripes, the person in the red top hat, and the small black screen. The description of their positioning and focus is also correct.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe description is very complete, covering the setting, subjects, key props, and overall visual style. It effectively paints a picture of the scene.\n\n**Adherence to the Given Instruction:**\nThe caption adheres to most of the instructions, such as being a single paragraph, using simple language, and avoiding speculation. However, it violates one negative constraint:\n\n*   **Violation:** The instruction states, \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\" The caption includes the phrases \"...**emphasizing** the focus on the group and the screen\" and \"...**highlighting** the simplicity and uniformity of the scene.\" These are interpretative statements that explain the *effect* or *purpose* of the visual composition, which is explicitly forbidden.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe caption is well-written and provides an accurate and comprehensive description of the scene. Its only flaw is the inclusion of interpretative language that explains what the scene \"emphasizes\" or \"highlights,\" which goes against the specific instructions provided. To be fully compliant, these interpretative phrases should be removed.",
