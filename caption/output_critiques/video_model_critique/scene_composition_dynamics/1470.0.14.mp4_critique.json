    "pre_caption": "The video is set indoors, featuring a room with neutral-colored walls and a simple, modern design. The lighting suggests daytime, with soft, natural light illuminating the space. Notable elements include a person wearing a white shirt and a striped tie, with distinct red hair. The room contains minimal furniture, with a visible door and a vent on the wall, contributing to a clean and uncluttered environment. The scene transitions smoothly, maintaining a consistent focus on the subject within the room, emphasizing the simplicity and clarity of the setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good for this video.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description of the lighting as \"daytime, with soft, natural light\" is highly inaccurate. The scene is dimly lit with a distinct, unnatural greenish-teal color grade, which creates a specific, unsettling mood, rather than the neutral and bright environment the caption suggests.\n*   The caption completely fails to mention the most significant visual events: the person has what appears to be makeup or a prosthetic creating a distorted smile, and their eyes turn completely white. These are not minor details; they are the central focus of the action.\n*   The caption misidentifies the visual effect of the eyes changing as a \"scene transition.\" A scene transition involves a change from one shot or location to another, which does not happen here. It is a change within a single, continuous shot.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is critically incomplete. By omitting the distorted facial features and the supernatural eye change, it fails to describe the core content of the video, presenting a mundane scene instead of the unsettling horror-like moment that actually occurs.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violation of Negative Constraints:** The caption violates the instruction, \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights,\" by stating that the \"transition\" is \"emphasizing the simplicity and clarity of the setting.\" This is an interpretive statement about the scene's purpose.\n*   **Misinterpretation of Instructions:** The caption misinterprets the term \"scene transition.\" The instruction is meant for videos that cut or pan between different settings, not for a visual effect applied to a subject within a single shot.\n*   **Failure to Describe Key Elements:** While the instructions advise focusing on the setting, they also require describing \"notable visual elements\" and changes/motion. The facial alteration and the eye effect are the most notable visual elements and the primary motion/change in the clip, and their omission makes the description fundamentally flawed.\n\nIn summary, the caption is poor because it is inaccurate about the lighting, incomplete by omitting the most crucial visual information, and non-compliant with the instructions by misinterpreting key terms and adding forbidden analysis. It describes a generic, neutral scene, which is a complete misrepresentation of the actual video content.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A close-up shot shows a person with red, bobbed hair in a dimly lit room with a greenish-teal color grade. They are wearing a white collared shirt and a blue and gold striped tie. Their face has what appears to be makeup or a prosthetic creating a distorted, wide smile. As they smile at the camera, their eyes turn completely white. In the background, a door and a wall vent are visible.",
