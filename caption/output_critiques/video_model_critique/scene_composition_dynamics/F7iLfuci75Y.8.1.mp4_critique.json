    "pre_caption": "In a dark, monochromatic setting, a figure in a white garment opens a heavy, textured vault door featuring a large, spoked wheel handle. The view shifts to reveal the room beyond the door, which has a dark, tiled floor. Inside, three bald, mannequin-like figures are seated with their backs to the camera at separate white desks, each working on a computer in a black office chair. The only significant light in the dim room emanates from the computer monitors. White subtitles with a black outline are present as an overlay at the bottom of the screen.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

The caption provides a thorough and accurate description that perfectly aligns with the provided instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is highly accurate in all its details. It correctly identifies the \"dark, monochromatic setting,\" the \"heavy, textured vault door\" with its \"spoked wheel handle,\" and the \"dark, tiled floor.\"\n*   The description of the subjects as \"bald, mannequin-like figures\" is precise and avoids making assumptions about their nature.\n*   It correctly notes that the primary light source is the \"computer monitors.\"\n*   The identification and description of the \"White subtitles with a black outline\" as an overlay are perfect.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully synthesizes the entire video clip into a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   It describes the initial action (\"opens a... door\"), the transition (\"The view shifts\"), and the resulting static scene.\n*   All significant visual elements, including the setting, props (desks, chairs, computers), and subjects, are included.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   The caption strictly follows all instructions. It is a single paragraph without any introductory text.\n*   It avoids subjective or emotional language, speculation (\"it appears,\" \"might be\"), and forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   It focuses on describing the scene and setting rather than inferring a narrative or purpose.\n*   The description of the camera movement (\"The view shifts\") is a good way to handle the transition without breaking the flow.",
