    "pre_caption": "In a dimly lit indoor setting, three figures with a reflective, metallic quality are seated in a row at black desks. Dressed in black, they sit in matching office chairs, each facing a computer. The monitors are the primary light source, casting a blue glow onto the figures and their surroundings. Each screen displays a light blue background with a white, window-like logo. The overall environment is dark and monochromatic, defined by the arrangement of workstations.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "An evaluation of the caption based on the provided instructions:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the number of figures, their reflective quality, their black clothing, and their positions at black desks with office chairs. The description of the monitors as the primary, blue light source is precise, as is the detail about the white, window-like logo on a light blue background.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is comprehensive, covering all significant visual elements of the scene. It details the setting, the subjects, the key props (desks, chairs, computers), the lighting, and the overall color scheme. No major visual information is omitted.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is concise and written in clear, natural English.\n*   **Objectivity:** It successfully avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (e.g., \"eerie,\" \"futuristic\") and speculative statements (e.g., \"they appear to be robots\"). The description of the figures as having a \"reflective, metallic quality\" is an excellent example of objective observation.\n*   **Focus:** The caption correctly focuses on the setting and scenery, using the figures to provide context without delving into their actions or identity.\n*   **Structure:** It is a single, coherent paragraph, as requested.\n*   **Forbidden Terms:** It avoids prohibited words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Setting and Details:** The caption clearly establishes an \"indoor setting,\" describes the key furniture, and notes the \"monochromatic\" style dominated by the blue light from the screens.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is excellent. It perfectly adheres to all instructions, providing a description that is accurate, detailed, and objective. It effectively paints a picture of the scene by focusing on concrete visual evidence, resulting in a high-quality, informative summary.",
