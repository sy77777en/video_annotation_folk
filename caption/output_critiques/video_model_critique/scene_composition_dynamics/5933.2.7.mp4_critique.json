    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an expansive outdoor setting during the day, featuring a vast, open field with patches of dry, golden grass and scattered pools of water. The sky is overcast with a layer of soft, textured clouds. In the distance, a line of bare trees marks the edge of a forest, creating a stark contrast against the sky. The scene is calm, with no visible movement, capturing the serene and quiet atmosphere of the natural landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good because it is inaccurate and incomplete, and it violates several key instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n- The caption is inaccurate when it states there is \"no visible movement.\" A small, distant figure of a person can be seen walking across the field from right to left.\n\n**Completeness:**\n- The caption is incomplete. It fails to mention the person walking in the field, which is a required detail as per the instruction: \"If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene.\"\n- It also completely omits the subtitle overlay at the bottom of the screen, which is a critical element that the instructions explicitly require to be described.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n- **Violation of Subjectivity Rule:** The caption uses subjective and emotional adjectives like \"calm\" and \"serene,\" which the instructions prohibit.\n- **Violation of Interpretation Rule:** The phrase \"capturing the serene and quiet atmosphere of the natural landscape\" is an interpretation of the scene's mood, which violates the instruction: \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\"\n- **Violation of Overlay Rule:** The caption fails to mention the subtitle overlay, directly contradicting the instruction to \"specify that they are overlays... and describe their content and placement.\"\n\nHere is a revised caption that adheres to the instructions:\n\nThis is a static, wide shot of an expansive outdoor marsh during the day under an overcast sky filled with textured clouds. The foreground and midground consist of a vast field of dry, brownish-yellow grass interspersed with small pools of water. In the distance, a dense line of bare trees borders the horizon.
