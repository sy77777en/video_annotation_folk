    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor setting with a dimly lit, high-tech environment. The scene features a hand interacting with electronic equipment, including a radio and a screen displaying data. The equipment is characterized by dark metallic surfaces with illuminated buttons and dials, emitting a warm orange glow. The screen shows complex graphics and text, suggesting a technical or control room atmosphere. The lighting is low, creating a moody ambiance with shadows and focused highlights on the devices. The overall color scheme is a mix of dark tones with contrasting bright lights, enhancing the technological and slightly mysterious feel of the setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on the caption. It is accurate, well-written, and captures the essence of the scene. However, there are a few areas where it deviates from the specific negative constraints in the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the indoor, high-tech setting, the interaction with electronic equipment, the dark metallic surfaces, the warm orange glow of the lights, and the presence of complex graphics on a screen.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe description is comprehensive, covering the key visual elements, lighting, and color scheme. It successfully combines the details from the shot of the hand turning the dial and the brief shot of the screen into a single, coherent paragraph as instructed.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption follows most instructions well, but it violates a few key negative constraints:\n\n*   **Violation 1: Use of Subjective/Emotional Adjectives.**\n    *   **Instruction:** \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\"\n    *   **Caption:** \"...creating a **moody** ambiance...\" and \"...slightly **mysterious** feel of the setting.\"\n    *   **Feedback:** The words \"moody\" and \"mysterious\" are subjective interpretations of the scene's atmosphere. A more objective description would focus only on the visual facts, such as the low-key lighting and high contrast, without assigning an emotional quality to them.\n\n*   **Violation 2: Explaining Emphasis or Effect.**\n    *   **Instruction:** \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\"\n    *   **Caption:** \"...**enhancing** the technological and slightly mysterious feel of the setting.\"\n    *   **Feedback:** This phrase explains the *purpose* or *effect* of the color scheme rather than simply describing the color scheme itself. The instruction requires describing only what is visually present, not interpreting its artistic or narrative function.\n\n*   **Violation 3: Minor Inference.**\n    *   **Instruction:** \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting.\"\n    *   **Caption:** \"...**suggesting** a technical or control room atmosphere.\"\n    *   **Feedback:** While a very logical conclusion, this is an inference about the type of room. The description is stronger when it sticks to the observable facts (e.g., \"The screen shows complex graphics and text\") and lets the reader make their own conclusion about the setting's role.\n\nIn summary, the caption is an excellent descriptive piece but could be improved by removing the subjective, interpretive, and inferential language to align perfectly with the provided instructions. The core factual descriptions are all very strong.",
