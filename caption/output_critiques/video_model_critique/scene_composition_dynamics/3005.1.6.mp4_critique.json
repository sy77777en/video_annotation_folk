    "pre_caption": "The video shows an indoor basketball court with wooden flooring and black painted key areas. The court is surrounded by tiered seating, mostly empty, with red and green sections. Basketball hoops with nets are at each end of the court. Several people are scattered around the court, some standing and others walking. The lighting is bright and even. Overlay text in Chinese appears at the bottom of the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is generally good, but it has some inaccuracies and omissions that could be improved for better adherence to the instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe description of the lighting as \"bright and even\" is inaccurate. The video clearly shows that the court is illuminated by spotlights, while the surrounding tiered seating is dark and in shadow. The lighting is focused and creates a high-contrast, dramatic effect rather than being evenly distributed.\n\n**Completeness:**\n- The caption fails to mention the high-angle point of view, which is a significant aspect of how the scene is presented to the viewer.\n- It omits the primary action in the scene: a person dribbling and preparing to shoot a basketball. The instructions state to describe motion if it is present.\n- While it mentions the overlay text is in Chinese, it doesn't mention the English subtitles that are also present.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n- The caption successfully describes the setting, environment, and key visual elements like the court markings and seating colors in a concise manner.\n- It correctly identifies the overlay text as an element separate from the scene.\n- It avoids speculation and subjective language, with the exception of the inaccurate description of the lighting.\n- It fails to describe the motion within the scene and the point of view, both of which are requested in the instructions.\n\n**Revised Caption Example:**\n\nFrom a high-angle perspective, the video captures an indoor basketball court with a light wooden floor and black-painted key areas. The court is illuminated by overhead lights, leaving the surrounding, mostly empty, red and green tiered seats in shadow. At each end of the court stands a basketball hoop. Several people are on the court, with one person in the foreground dribbling a basketball. An overlay at the bottom of the screen displays text in both Chinese and English.",
