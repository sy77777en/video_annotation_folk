    "pre_caption": "The scene is set indoors, in what appears to be a room with distinctive wallpaper featuring a stylized, possibly hand-drawn, figure with a crown-like headdress. A dark wooden dresser with ornate drawer pulls and an oval mirror in a carved frame sits against the wall. The overall color scheme is sepia-toned. A figure in a light-colored, collared jacket with dark buttons is seen interacting with the dresser, bending down towards its drawers.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on the caption. It is accurate, concise, and effectively captures the main visual elements of the scene. Here is a detailed breakdown of its adherence to the instructions:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description of the setting as an indoor room is correct.\n*   The details about the furniture—a dark wooden dresser, ornate drawer pulls, and an oval mirror in a carved frame—are all accurate.\n*   The description of the distinctive wallpaper, the stylized figure, and the sepia-toned color scheme is precise.\n*   The general description of the person and their action is also accurate.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully covers the most important aspects of the scene: the indoor setting, key props that define the space (dresser, mirror), unique decor (wallpaper), the overall visual style (sepia), and the presence and general action of a subject.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths:** The caption correctly follows most instructions. It is a single, coherent paragraph, focuses on the setting over the subject, avoids emotional language, and accurately describes the color, material, and shape of key objects. It also correctly identifies the motion of the figure.\n*   **Areas for Improvement:** The caption violates the instruction to \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options.\"\n    *   The phrase \"**in what appears to be** a room\" is speculative. It can be stated more directly as \"in an indoor room.\"\n    *   The phrase \"**possibly** hand-drawn\" is also speculative. The instruction is to describe what is visible without making assumptions. A better description would be \"wallpaper featuring a drawing of a stylized figure\" or \"wallpaper featuring a figure in a simple, linear style.\"\n\nOverall, the caption is very good, but it could be perfected by removing the speculative phrasing to fully comply with all instructions.",
