    "pre_caption": "The video takes place indoors in a gym setting with a focus on a wooden floor. The lighting suggests daytime, with natural light streaming in, casting soft shadows across the floor. The environment is spacious, with exercise equipment visible in the background, indicating an area dedicated to fitness activities. The floor is smooth and polished, with a warm, natural wood tone. The scene captures a person engaged in a workout, wearing athletic attire, including gloves and shorts, with movements suggesting physical exercise. The overall atmosphere is dynamic, emphasizing activity and motion within the gym space.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is mostly accurate in its description of the physical scene. It correctly identifies the indoor gym setting, the wooden floor, the daytime lighting, and the presence of a person exercising.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is incomplete. It misses a crucial visual element: the point of view. The scene is shot from a very low angle, close to the floor, which is a defining characteristic of the shot. It also fails to mention the slight panning motion of the camera that follows the subject's movement.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption violates multiple negative constraints from the instructions:\n\n*   **Violation of \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting\":** The phrase \"...indicating an area dedicated to fitness activities\" is an inference about the purpose of the space, which is explicitly forbidden.\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":** The word \"dynamic\" is a subjective description of the atmosphere.\n*   **Violation of \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights\":** The final clause, \"...emphasizing activity and motion within the gym space,\" directly explains the scene's focus, which the instructions prohibit.\n\nIn summary, while the caption correctly identifies some basic elements, it fails by including subjective interpretations, inferring the setting's purpose, and explaining the scene's emphasis. It also omits key details like the camera's low-angle perspective and movement, making it an inadequate description according to the provided rules.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A low-angle, close-up shot from the floor shows a woman performing a push-up on a light-brown wooden plank floor. She wears a purple sports bra, red shorts, and black and red fingerless gloves. Light from an unseen source casts shadows across the floor. In the out-of-focus background, exercise equipment is visible. The camera pans slightly to the right, following her movement.",
