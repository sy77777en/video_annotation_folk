    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor restaurant setting with a warm, inviting atmosphere. The environment features several tables with white tablecloths, occupied by patrons enjoying their meals. The walls are adorned with large, intricate artworks that add a cultural touch to the space. The lighting is soft, creating a cozy ambiance. The carpeted floor complements the overall decor, enhancing the restaurant's traditional style. Notable visual elements include a man at a table, engaged in an animated manner with his meal, adding a dynamic aspect to the otherwise calm setting. The scene captures a lively yet relaxed dining experience, with people conversing and enjoying their food.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "This caption is not good. It fails to adhere to several key instructions, resulting in a description that is both inaccurate in its omissions and violates the core principles of objectivity and detail.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy and Completeness:**\n*   **Major Omission:** The caption's most significant failure is omitting the central, most unusual action in the video: a man eating noodles by lifting them to his mouth with a small, blue, handheld fan. Describing him as merely \"engaged in an animated manner\" is a gross understatement that misses the entire point of the visual.\n*   **Incomplete Descriptions:** The \"large, intricate artworks\" are not described with any specific detail (e.g., their brown, textured, bas-relief style depicting a landscape with a bridge).\n*   **Potential Inaccuracy/Speculation:** The caption mentions a \"carpeted floor,\" but the flooring is not clearly visible in the shot. This is a speculative detail, which is explicitly forbidden by the instructions.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violation of Objectivity:** The caption is filled with subjective and emotional language, which is strictly prohibited. Words and phrases like \"warm, inviting atmosphere,\" \"cozy ambiance,\" and \"lively yet relaxed dining experience\" are interpretations of the mood, not objective descriptions of the scene.\n*   **Violation of \"No Inferences\":** The caption makes several inferential statements. For example, stating the artworks \"add a cultural touch\" or that the floor \"complements the overall decor, enhancing the restaurant's traditional style\" are analytical judgments, not factual descriptions.\n*   **Lack of Detail for Notable Elements:** The instructions require describing the color, material, and shape of notable visual elements. The caption fails to do this for the most notable element of all—the blue fan—and provides only a generic description of the wall art.\n*   **Focus:** While it attempts to focus on the setting, it does so by using forbidden subjective language and misses the most important descriptive detail of the subject's action, which is essential context for the scene.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In an indoor restaurant setting, a man with dark hair, wearing a light-colored, short-sleeved collared shirt, sits at a table and eats from a white bowl of noodles. He has his mouth wide open and is lifting the noodles using a small, blue, plastic, handheld fan with white blades. He wears a watch with a blue band on his left wrist, which is holding the fan. To his right, another man with dark hair and black-rimmed glasses, wearing a yellow collared shirt, looks on while holding chopsticks. On the table, which is covered with a white cloth, are bowls of food, a plate of green vegetables, and a glass of dark liquid. The background features light-colored patterned wallpaper and two large, rectangular, brown, textured bas-relief artworks depicting landscapes; the one on the right shows a bridge. Other patrons are seated at tables in the background, and a waiter in an apron stands near a table.",
