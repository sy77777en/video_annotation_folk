    "pre_caption": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes holding a dark gray firearm, shows an outdoor, urban setting during the daytime. The view encompasses light-colored concrete or stucco buildings, one of which has an external black metal staircase that a figure briefly ascends. A dark green armored vehicle is visible in the distance, positioned near stacked wooden crates on the dusty ground. The perspective then moves forward, entering a more enclosed area characterized by wooden scaffolding or debris, with light filtering through gaps in the structure. A heads-up display is overlaid on the view, featuring a mini-map with icons and text in the bottom left, ammunition and status bars in the bottom right, and objective markers in the upper central area.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is good.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption accurately describes all the key visual elements. It correctly identifies the first-person POV, the firearm, the outdoor urban setting, the daytime lighting, the buildings, the black metal staircase, the figure, the dark green armored vehicle, the wooden crates, and the dusty ground. It also precisely describes the movement into the enclosed area with wooden scaffolding and the details of the heads-up display (HUD).\n*   **Completeness:** The description is comprehensive, covering the point of view, setting, time of day, notable objects, motion, and overlays as requested by the instructions. It successfully synthesizes information from the entire clip into a single, coherent narrative.\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   It correctly identifies the **point of view** as \"first-person POV.\"\n    *   It describes the **setting** (\"outdoor, urban setting\") and its features (\"light-colored concrete or stucco buildings,\" \"dusty ground\") without speculating on a specific location.\n    *   It correctly identifies the **motion** (\"The perspective then moves forward...\") and the resulting change in scenery.\n    *   It properly identifies the **HUD** as an \"overlay\" and describes its components and placement.\n    *   It avoids subjective or emotional language, speculation (\"appears,\" \"might be\"), and inferences about the scene's purpose (e.g., \"warzone,\" \"battle\").\n    *   The description of the \"figure\" is minimal and contextual, adhering to the instruction to not focus on subjects in detail.\n    *   The language is simple, natural, and objective.\n    *   The final output is a single, well-structured paragraph.",
