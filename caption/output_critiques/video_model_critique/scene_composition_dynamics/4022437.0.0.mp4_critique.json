    "pre_caption": "From a low-angle perspective close to the ground, the scene is set in a paved asphalt parking lot during the day under a partly cloudy blue sky. A black sedan with a tan interior is parked with all four of its doors open. In the background, there are several single-story white buildings, a chain-link fence, and a distant construction crane. The camera slowly moves forward across the worn pavement, which is marked with white parking lines, approaching the rear three-quarter view of the car.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work. The caption is a perfect fit for the video and follows all instructions precisely.\n\n### Feedback Breakdown:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is entirely accurate. It correctly identifies the low-angle perspective, the setting as a paved asphalt parking lot, the time of day, and the weather. The description of the black sedan with its tan interior and all four doors open is precise. The background elements (white buildings, fence, crane) and the details of the pavement (worn, white lines) are all spot-on. The description of the camera's slow forward movement is also correct.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is very complete. It covers all the essential aspects of the scene: the point of view, the primary subject and its state, the environment, background details, and the subtle camera motion. It provides a comprehensive overview without missing any key visual information.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres perfectly to the guidelines.\n    *   It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n    *   It uses simple, objective, and natural language.\n    *   It correctly identifies the point of view and the camera motion.\n    *   It avoids speculation, emotional adjectives, and subjective interpretations.\n    *   It focuses on describing the setting and scenery, treating the car as an element within it.\n    *   It does not use forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   It does not infer the purpose of the location (e.g., calling it a school).",
