    "pre_caption": "A third-person isometric (2.5D) gaming video with a tilted overhead angle shows a pixel-art bedroom at night. The room is furnished with a double bed featuring a black headboard and grey chevron-patterned bedding, set against a large window that looks out onto a brightly lit city skyline. The bed is flanked by two black nightstands, and a white bi-fold closet door is visible on the right wall. During the sequence, items are placed into the scene, including a pink stuffed pig and a framed certificate on the left nightstand, and a cardboard box filled with crumpled paper at the foot of the bed. The scene is framed by a gaming user interface, with icons for camera controls, room navigation, and zoom functions in the corners.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A third-person isometric (2.5D) gaming video with a tilted overhead angle showing the environment in a three-quarters perspective.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is mostly accurate but can be improved by adding omitted details and refining the description of the on-screen actions and overlays for better clarity and completeness. The phrase \"items are seen in the scene\" is passive and doesn't accurately describe the action of items appearing. The caption also omits several notable items that appear, such as the folded clothes on the bed and the items on the right nightstand. Additionally, the on-screen cursor is a key part of the user interface that should be mentioned.\n\nHere are the suggested edits:\n- Change \"grey chevron-patterned bedding\" to \"grey chevron-patterned bedding and stacks of folded clothes.\"\n- After the description of the nightstands, add details about their contents by saying, \"The bed is flanked by two black nightstands, one of which holds a digital clock and a briefcase.\"\n- Replace \"During the sequence, items are seen in the scene, including a pink stuffed pig on the left nightstand and a cardboard box filled with crumpled paper at the left foot of the bed\" with a more active and comprehensive description: \"Throughout the video, items appear in the room, including a pink stuffed pig on the left nightstand and a cardboard box with crumpled paper at the foot of the bed.\"\n- Rephrase \"A framed certificate is controlled by the mouse and moves around the room\" to \"A framed certificate appears and is moved around the room by an on-screen cursor.\"\n- Modify the final sentence to include the cursor: \"The scene is framed by a gaming user interface, with an on-screen cursor and icons for camera controls, room navigation, and zoom functions in the corners.\"",
