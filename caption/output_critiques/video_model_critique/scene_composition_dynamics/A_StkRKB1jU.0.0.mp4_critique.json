    "pre_caption": "A video filmed by a drone captures an urban cityscape during the day. The scene features a collection of high-rise buildings with a mix of modern and classic architectural styles. The buildings are primarily composed of glass and concrete, with reflective surfaces that catch the sunlight. The drone's perspective provides a sweeping view of the city, highlighting the geometric patterns of the windows and the grid-like arrangement of the structures. The sky is clear, adding a bright backdrop to the scene. Notably, one building's glass facade shows a visible impact mark, creating a contrast with the otherwise smooth surfaces. The overall atmosphere is calm, with no visible movement or activity, emphasizing the static nature of the urban environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A video filmed by a drone.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption generally follows the instruction by describing the drone point of view, the urban outdoor setting, the time of day, and the architectural features of the buildings. However, it inaccurately states that there is \"evidence of an explosion of one of its glass panels\" before this event actually occurs in the video; the explosion happens later, not as a static feature. The caption also incorrectly describes the overall atmosphere as \"calm, with no visible movement or activity,\" when the video includes a dynamic event (the glass panel explosion) and some rooftop activity. The caption should mention the motion of the drone as it moves closer to the glass building, the presence of people on the rooftop, and the moment when a glass panel explodes, sending debris outward. There are no overlays present, so this does not need to be mentioned. To improve, the caption should accurately describe the sequence of the drone's movement, the rooftop details, the presence of people, and the explosion event, while removing the incorrect implication that the explosion is a static feature.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A drone captures a dynamic urban cityscape during the day, showcasing a mix of modern and classic high-rise buildings primarily made of glass and concrete. The reflective surfaces catch the sunlight, creating a striking visual effect. As the drone moves closer to one of the glass buildings, it reveals people on a rooftop, adding a sense of activity to the scene. Suddenly, a glass panel on the building explodes, sending debris outward and contrasting with the otherwise smooth surfaces. The drone's perspective highlights the geometric patterns of the windows and the grid-like arrangement of the structures, set against a clear sky. The sequence of events adds a dynamic element to the urban environment, capturing both the calm and the unexpected.",
