    "pre_caption": "A dark, stylized map of the eastern United States is shown, with faint gray lines representing roads and state borders. The Great Lakes are visible in the upper portion of the map, and the Atlantic coastline is on the right. Overlaying the map, orange text and circles identify \"OFFUT AIR FORCE BASE\" in the west and \"JOINT BASE ANDREWS\" in the east. A dashed orange line connects the two locations, and an orange airplane icon moves from west to east along this line, indicating a flight path between the two bases.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is excellent and adheres to all instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the geographical area as the eastern United States, notes the presence of the Great Lakes and the Atlantic coastline, and precisely describes the stylized, dark appearance of the map with its faint gray lines. The description of the orange overlay elements—the text, circles, dashed line, and moving airplane icon—is also spot-on.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is comprehensive, covering all significant visual information. It details the static background (the map) and the dynamic foreground element (the moving icon), effectively capturing the entire scene. It correctly identifies the start and end points of the flight path as labeled on the map.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Content and Style:** The caption provides a concise, objective description, focusing on the visual setting and elements as instructed. It avoids subjective language, speculation, and any interpretation of the scene's purpose.\n*   **Overlays:** It correctly identifies the text, icons, and lines as \"overlaying the map\" and describes their appearance and content.\n*   **Motion:** The movement of the airplane icon from west to east is clearly described.\n*   **Formatting:** The output is a single, well-structured paragraph without any introductory text or markdown, as required.\n*   **Prohibited Terms:** The caption successfully avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n\nThe caption is a perfect example of how to follow the provided guidelines to create a clear, detailed, and objective description of the video content.",
