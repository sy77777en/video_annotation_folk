    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor setting with dim lighting, creating a shadowy and mysterious atmosphere. The environment appears to be a workshop or mechanical space, characterized by industrial elements. A beam of light cuts through the darkness, highlighting dust particles in the air. The walls are obscured, but a yellow garment hangs in the background, adding a splash of color. The scene includes machinery with visible wires and metal components, suggesting a focus on technical or mechanical work. The overall color palette is dark, with muted tones and subtle contrasts between light and shadow.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good for this video. While it accurately describes some static elements of the setting, it fails to adhere to several key instructions and omits the most significant action in the scene.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description of the indoor setting, dim lighting, beam of light, yellow garment, and machinery is factually correct based on what is visible.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   **Major Omission:** The caption completely fails to mention the person in the scene and their actions. The video's primary focus is a person getting frustrated and striking an object. Omitting this central element makes the description fundamentally incomplete.\n*   **Motion:** The instructions require a description of motion. The caption does not mention the man's rapid, violent movements as he hits the object on the table.\n*   **Point of View:** The caption does not mention the point of view, which is a low-angle shot from behind a piece of machinery, contributing to the scene's composition.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Avoid Speculative Statements:** The caption violates this rule by using phrases like \"The environment **appears to be** a workshop...\" The instruction is to describe what is present, not what it seems to be.\n*   **Do Not Infer Role or Purpose:** The caption violates this rule with the phrase \"**suggesting a focus on** technical or mechanical work.\" This infers the purpose of the setting rather than simply describing it.\n*   **Avoid Emotional or Subjective Adjectives:** The phrase \"mysterious atmosphere\" is a subjective interpretation, which the instructions advise against.\n*   **Describe Subjects and Motion:** The instructions state to include subjects and describe motion. The caption's failure to mention the person and their actions is a direct violation of these guidelines. The subject and their motion are not minor details; they are the central event of the clip.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a low-angle perspective behind a piece of machinery, a man is seen in a dark, hazy room. A single, bright beam of light shines down from the upper right, illuminating him and the dust in the air. The man, wearing a dark jacket, leans over a workbench and repeatedly strikes an object on it, first with his hand and then with a metal object. He then sweeps his arm across the table, knocking items off. In the dark background to the left, a yellow garment hangs on a wall. The foreground is dominated by the out-of-focus silhouette of a mechanical device with wires and metal components. The scene is dimly lit with strong contrast between the light beam and the surrounding shadows.",
