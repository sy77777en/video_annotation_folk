    "pre_caption": "The scene is set in a lush, green landscape of rolling hills covered in dense trees under a dramatic sky. A vibrant rainbow arches across the sky, which is a mix of blue patches and dark, heavy clouds. The foreground consists of a grassy, unkempt clearing with small trees. The view pans upward, following the curve of the rainbow as it rises from behind a hill and extends high into the cloudy expanse, with the tops of green trees visible throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is good.\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the rolling hills, dense trees, the mix of blue sky and dark clouds, and the prominent rainbow. The description of the camera motion as an upward pan that follows the rainbow's arc is also precise.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete, covering the setting, environment, key visual elements, and motion. It effectively describes the foreground, the landscape, the sky, and the rainbow. It could have explicitly mentioned the time of day (daytime), but the description of the sky implies it.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption adheres well to the instructions.\n- It provides a concise, single-paragraph description.\n- It focuses on the setting and scenery.\n- It avoids speculation and overly subjective or emotional language (adjectives like \"lush,\" \"vibrant,\" and \"dramatic\" are acceptable as they are strongly descriptive of the visual facts).\n- It correctly identifies and describes the camera motion (\"pans upward\").\n- It combines details from the video into a cohesive narrative without referring to specific frames.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A vibrant rainbow arches over a lush landscape of rolling, forested hills under a dramatic sky. The view begins in a grassy foreground before panning upward, following the rainbow's curve as it rises into the sky, which is filled with a mix of dark, heavy clouds and patches of blue. Throughout the pan, the green canopy of the hills and trees remains visible below the colorful arc.",
