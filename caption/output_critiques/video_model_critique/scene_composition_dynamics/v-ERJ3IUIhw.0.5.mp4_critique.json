    "pre_caption": "The video presents a minimalist, animated scene with a clean, white background. Initially, a dynamic, abstract form resembling a spiral or shell unfolds, characterized by smooth, flowing lines and a monochromatic blue hue. This shape suggests movement and transformation, with a sense of fluidity and elegance. As the scene progresses, the focus shifts to a stylized architectural structure, depicted with simple, linear outlines. The building features a prominent circular window or clock at its center, adorned with intricate blue detailing, and is flanked by symmetrical rows of windows. The overall aesthetic is clean and geometric, emphasizing simplicity and symmetry in design.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption inaccurately describes the initial animation and includes subjective interpretations forbidden by the instructions. The video does not begin with a \"spiral or shell\" but with a circle divided into twelve segments. The description of the shape \"unfolding\" and having \"fluidity and elegance\" is subjective. The final sentence, \"The overall aesthetic is clean and geometric, emphasizing simplicity and symmetry in design,\" explains the scene's emphasis, which is explicitly disallowed. The caption should be rewritten to factually describe the time-lapse drawing process. It should start by describing the initial circle with its twelve segments, then detail the addition of concentric circles and patterns to form the intricate design, and conclude by describing how the drawing expands to reveal this design as the central window of a building facade.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This time-lapse video shows a line drawing being created with a blue pen on a white background. The process begins with the drawing of a circle, which is then divided into twelve equal segments by lines radiating from the center. Subsequently, concentric circles and various patterns, including a central flower-like shape and a ring of smaller circles, are added within the initial circle to form an intricate design. The drawing then expands to reveal that this circular design is the central window of a building's facade. The final steps involve drawing the rest of the symmetrical building, including rows of rectangular windows on either side of the central feature.",
