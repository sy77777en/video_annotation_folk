    "pre_caption": "The video takes place in a stark, minimalist indoor setting with a monochromatic color scheme dominated by white. The environment is clinical and futuristic, featuring a group of individuals dressed in white, full-body suits with hoods, gathered around a small screen. One person stands out with a distinctive red top hat, adding a splash of color to the scene. The screen displays a small, white figure against a black background, drawing the group's attention. The setting is devoid of additional furniture or props, emphasizing the focus on the screen and the individuals' interaction with it. The overall atmosphere is one of curiosity and observation, with the clean, uncluttered space enhancing the futuristic and sterile feel.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good for this video. It violates several key instructions by including subjective interpretations, explaining the scene's emphasis, and omitting important details.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the issues:\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\" and \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting\":** The caption uses interpretive words like \"stark,\" \"minimalist,\" \"clinical,\" and \"futuristic.\" It also describes a subjective \"atmosphere is one of curiosity and observation\" and a \"sterile feel,\" which are inferences about the mood and setting rather than objective descriptions.\n*   **Violation of \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights\":** The caption contains analytical statements such as \"...emphasizing the focus on the screen...\" and \"...enhancing the futuristic and sterile feel.\" These phrases explain the director's or cinematographer's intent, which is explicitly forbidden by the instructions.\n*   **Incompleteness:** The caption misses several observable details. It fails to mention the orange stripes on the white suits, the point of view (which is from behind the group, looking over their shoulders), and the motion within the scene (the small white figure on the screen shrinks and disappears).\n*   **Minor Inaccuracy:** The caption describes the top hat as \"red,\" when it is more accurately a brown or maroon color.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a white room, the shot is framed from behind three people looking at a screen. They are dressed in white, full-body suits with hoods and orange stripes. To their right, a fourth person, also in a white suit and hood but wearing a brown top hat, leans in to look at the screen. The small screen, set into a white console, displays a small, white, human-like figure against a black background. As they watch, the figure on the screen shrinks until it disappears.",
