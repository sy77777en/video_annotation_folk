    "pre_caption": "The video, captured from a drone POV, showcases a dynamic outdoor scene on a snowy track. It features a sports car with a striking red, blue, and white color scheme, prominently displaying numbers and markings on its sleek, aerodynamic body. The setting is a wintry landscape with snow-covered ground and a backdrop of tall, dark evergreen trees. The time of day appears to be late afternoon, with the sun casting a bright glow, creating a contrast between the car's vibrant colors and the white snow. The car is in motion, kicking up snow as it speeds along the track, emphasizing the sense of movement and energy in the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A video filmed by a drone.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good for this video.\n\n### Feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description of the scene, car, and setting is generally accurate.\n*   However, stating the time of day is \"late afternoon\" is speculative. The instruction explicitly says to avoid speculative statements like \"it appears.\" A more accurate and compliant description would be \"daytime,\" as the sun is bright but its exact position is unclear.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption fails to mention that the video is composed of several quick cuts between different dynamic camera angles (e.g., front-facing, top-down, side-tracking). It describes the scene as if it were a single, continuous shot, which is not the case.\n*   While it mentions \"numbers and markings,\" it omits specific, prominent details like the \"PORSCHE\" text on the windshield and the \"-30°\" and \"+30°\" markings on the hood and sides, which are key visual elements.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":** The caption uses the word \"striking\" to describe the color scheme, which is a subjective judgment.\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid speculative statements\":** The phrase \"appears to be late afternoon\" is a direct violation of this rule.\n*   **Violation of \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights\":** The final clause, \"emphasizing the sense of movement and energy in the scene,\" is an interpretation of the video's effect rather than a neutral description of its content.\n*   **Violation of \"If scene transitions occur, explain how they happen\":** The caption completely ignores the rapid hard cuts between different shots, which is a significant feature of the video's structure.\n*   **Violation of \"Provide a concise yet informative description\":** By omitting the scene transitions and specific markings, the description lacks key information.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video is a fast-paced montage of a sports car driving on a snowy track during the daytime. The car has a red, blue, and white livery. The video begins with a high-angle, motion-blurred shot of the car's hood, which features the text \"#Drive2Extremes\" and markings for \"-30°\" and \"+30°\". It then hard cuts to a front-facing shot of the car driving towards the camera, kicking up snow, with \"PORSCHE\" written on the windshield and evergreen trees in the background. Another hard cut shows a top-down view of the car's roof and windshield in motion. The final shot is a low-angle view tracking the car's blue side as it drifts, showing a white circle with \"-30°\" and its spinning wheels displacing snow.",
