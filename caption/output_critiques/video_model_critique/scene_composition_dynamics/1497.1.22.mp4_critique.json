    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor setting within an elegant restaurant featuring large glass windows. The environment is characterized by classic decor, including dark green curtains and white tablecloths on dining tables, some of which have candles. The scene captures a moment of dynamic motion as a person in formal attire crashes through a glass window, causing shards to scatter. The lighting suggests it is daytime, with natural light illuminating the interior. The weather outside appears to be snowy, as indicated by the snow visible through the windows. Overlay elements include a watermark in the bottom left corner, labeled \"MOVIECLIPS,\" which is not part of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good for this video.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is fundamentally inaccurate in its description of the central action and setting. The person does not crash through \"large glass windows\" leading outside. They crash through a large, self-contained structure *inside* the restaurant, which appears to be an aquarium or a large water/ice feature.\n*   This initial error leads to a cascade of other inaccuracies. The \"snow visible through the windows\" is not outdoor weather; it is the contents of the shattered indoor structure.\n*   The description of the lighting is incorrect. The caption states it is \"daytime, with natural light,\" but the scene is clearly lit by warm, artificial interior lights (wall sconces are visible). The bright, cool light originates from the structure that is broken, not from the sun.\n*   The watermark is \"MOVIECLIPS.COM,\" not just \"MOVIECLIPS.\"\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption omits a key detail of the event: the massive splash of water that erupts from the structure along with the shards of glass/ice.\n*   It fails to mention the distinct color contrast between the warm, yellow-toned lighting of the restaurant and the cool, blue-toned light emanating from the shattered structure.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   The caption violates the instruction to \"Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain\" and \"Avoid speculative statements.\" By misinterpreting the central structure as a window, it invents details about the time of day (daytime) and weather (snowy) that are not supported by the visual evidence.\n*   While it correctly identifies some elements like the curtains and tablecloths, its failure to accurately describe the most prominent visual element (the shattered structure) and the lighting means it does not provide a \"clear, concise, and coherent\" description of the scene as required.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "An interior shot captures a dramatic moment inside an elegant, warmly lit restaurant. A man in a dark suit and white shirt crashes through a large, vertical, glass-walled structure, which appears to be an aquarium or a decorative water feature. The impact causes a massive explosion of water and shards of glass or ice to burst into the room. There is a stark visual contrast between the warm, yellow-toned ambient light of the restaurant and the bright, cool, blue-white light emanating from the shattered structure. In the background, dark green curtains and tables with white cloths are visible. A watermark for \"MOVIECLIPS.COM\" is in the bottom left corner.",
