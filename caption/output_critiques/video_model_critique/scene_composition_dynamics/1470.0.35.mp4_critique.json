    "pre_caption": "The video is set in a bright, vintage-style kitchen with a warm, inviting atmosphere. The room features a yellow door and patterned wallpaper, adding a retro touch. A large, cream-colored refrigerator stands prominently on the right, with a smooth, glossy surface. A wooden dining table with chairs is visible on the left, contributing to the cozy, domestic setting. The lighting suggests daytime, with natural light filtering through a window, softly illuminating the space. A vase with blue flowers adds a pop of color on a countertop. The scene captures a moment of activity, with several people interacting, enhancing the lively, familial ambiance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains subjective and interpretive language, such as \"warm, inviting atmosphere,\" \"retro touch,\" \"cozy, domestic setting,\" \"adds a pop of color,\" and \"lively, familial ambiance,\" which should be removed to adhere to the instruction to avoid emotional or subjective adjectives and not explain what the scene emphasizes. The statement that light is \"filtering through a window\" is speculative, as the light source is not visible. The caption also omits several key visual details, including the patterned wallpaper, the white wainscoting, and the tall, narrow white cabinet to the left of the yellow door. To improve, the description should be revised to be more objective, focusing only on visible elements and incorporating the missing details of the walls and cabinetry.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The scene takes place in a brightly lit kitchen. In the background, there is a yellow door. To the left of the door, the wall features light-colored patterned wallpaper above white wainscoting, along with a tall, narrow white cabinet. A large, cream-colored refrigerator is on the right side of the frame. In the bottom left, a portion of a wooden dining table and a chair are visible. A vase containing blue and yellow flowers sits on a surface near the refrigerator. A woman in a blue and white checkered dress is in the room as several other people enter through the yellow door.",
