    "pre_caption": "A Boeing 747, painted in the livery of Air Force One, is stationary on a dark gray, featureless ground plane. The background is completely black, creating a stark, isolated setting. The aircraft's fuselage is white on top and light blue on the bottom, with \"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\" printed along its side, an American flag on the tail, and the presidential seal near the nose. The plane's landing gear is deployed, and small red lights are visible on the aircraft's body and wingtips. The scene is evenly lit, highlighting the plane against the dark surroundings.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good for this video.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe description of the aircraft and its immediate environment is accurate. The details about the Air Force One livery, the deployed landing gear, the red lights, the dark gray ground, and the black background are all correct.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is incomplete. It completely omits the white text overlay (subtitles) at the bottom of the screen, which reads, \"Boeing 747 with the usual call sign Air Force One.\" The instructions explicitly require the description of overlays, including \"subtitles, captions.\" This is a significant omission.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption fails to adhere to several key instructions:\n*   **Overlay Elements:** As mentioned above, it fails to describe the text overlay, which is a direct violation of the instructions.\n*   **Subjective Adjectives:** The phrase \"creating a stark, isolated setting\" uses subjective adjectives (\"stark,\" \"isolated\"). The instructions state to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\"\n*   **Explaining Emphasis:** The phrase \"highlighting the plane\" can be interpreted as explaining what the scene emphasizes, which the instructions forbid (\"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights\").\n\nWhile the caption is well-written and mostly accurate in its visual description, its failure to include the required information about the overlay and its use of subjective/interpretive language make it non-compliant with the provided guidelines.",
