    "pre_caption": "The video presents an indoor setting with a stark, clinical atmosphere. The environment is predominantly white, featuring smooth surfaces and minimalistic design elements. Two individuals are present, dressed in white suits with orange stripes, wearing goggles on their heads. The background includes indistinct, white objects that blend into the setting, enhancing the sterile and uniform appearance. The lighting is bright and even, contributing to the clean and controlled ambiance of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"\n\nMake your output sound natural, as if written by a thoughtful human. Keep the tone conversational, clear, and professional—no stiff or overly formal language. Prioritize readability, flow, and conciseness.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is good but not perfect. Here is a detailed breakdown:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the indoor setting, the predominantly white color scheme, the minimalist design, the attire of the two individuals (white suits with orange stripes and goggles), the indistinct background, and the bright, even lighting.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is incomplete. It fails to mention a key element specified in the instructions:\n*   **Overlays:** The video contains a subtitle overlay at the bottom that reads, \"Our little group is getting smaller by the minute.\" The instructions explicitly require the description of any overlay elements, including their content and placement.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   It successfully provides a concise, one-paragraph description.\n    *   It focuses on the setting and scenery rather than excessive character detail.\n    *   It uses simple, natural English and avoids speculative language (\"might be,\" \"appears\").\n    *   It correctly describes the visual style (stark, clinical, minimalistic).\n    *   It avoids inferring the scene's role or purpose.\n\n*   **Weaknesses:**\n    *   The primary failure is the omission of the subtitle overlay, which is a direct violation of the instructions.\n    *   While not strictly required unless relevant, mentioning the point of view (a medium close-up) would have added more context to how the scene is presented to the viewer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe caption is well-written and accurately describes the visual aesthetics of the scene. However, its failure to include the required description of the subtitle overlay makes it non-compliant with the instructions. To be fully compliant, it must mention the presence, content, and location of the subtitles.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video presents a medium close-up of two individuals in an indoor setting with a stark, clinical atmosphere. The environment is predominantly white, featuring smooth surfaces and minimalistic design elements. The two people are dressed in white suits with orange stripes and wear goggles on their heads. The background includes indistinct, white objects, and the lighting is bright and even, enhancing the sterile ambiance.
