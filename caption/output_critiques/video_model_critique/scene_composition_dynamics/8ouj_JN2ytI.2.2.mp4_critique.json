    "pre_caption": "The scene is set indoors in a dimly lit room with a serious atmosphere, likely a control or command center. The environment features dark walls and subdued lighting, creating a focused and intense setting. Several individuals in military uniforms are present, with one prominently positioned in the foreground. The uniforms are dark blue with various colorful insignias and medals, indicating rank and achievements. The background includes blurred screens emitting a soft glow, suggesting the presence of technology and monitoring equipment.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Your feedback is excellent. Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate in its description of the visible elements. It correctly identifies the indoor, dimly lit setting, the presence of individuals in military uniforms, the dark blue color of the uniforms with their decorations, and the glowing screens in the background.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is comprehensive, covering the environment, the subjects' general appearance and placement, and key background details. It successfully paints a clear picture of the scene.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows some instructions well but violates several key negative constraints.\n\n*   **Strengths (Adherence):**\n    *   It correctly identifies the setting as indoors and describes its key features (dim lighting, dark walls).\n    *   It provides a concise, single-paragraph description.\n    *   It describes the subjects' placement and appearance without excessive detail, focusing more on how they contribute to the overall scene.\n    *   It accurately describes the color and features of notable elements like the uniforms and screens.\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement (Violations):**\n    *   **Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives:** The caption uses several subjective terms, such as \"serious atmosphere,\" \"intense setting,\" \"formal and professional,\" and \"sense of authority and purpose.\" The instructions explicitly forbid using such language.\n    *   **Avoid speculative statements:** The phrase \"likely a control or command center\" is a speculative inference about the room's function. The instructions state to avoid such guesses.\n    *   **Do not infer the role of the scene setting:** Directly related to the point above, identifying the location as a \"control or command center\" infers its role rather than just describing its physical appearance.\n    *   **Avoid inferential language:** The phrase \"suggesting the presence of technology and monitoring equipment\" is an interpretation of what the screens imply, not a direct description of what is visible. A more compliant description would simply state that blurred, glowing screens are present.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is well-written and provides an accurate and evocative description of the scene. However, it fails to adhere strictly to the negative constraints of the prompt by including subjective, speculative, and inferential language. To be fully compliant, the caption should be revised to describe only what is objectively visible, removing all interpretations of mood, atmosphere, and function.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a dimly lit room with dark walls, a man in a dark blue military uniform stands in the foreground. His jacket is adorned with numerous colorful ribbon bars, medals, and insignia on the chest and shoulders. Behind him and out of focus, other individuals in uniform are present, along with several blurred screens that emit a soft glow.",
