    "pre_caption": "The video, captured from a drone POV, transitions from a dimly lit, narrow tunnel with an arched entrance to a bright, expansive outdoor scene. Initially, the tunnel's stone walls and floor lead to an opening that reveals a glimpse of greenery. The setting then shifts to a coastal landscape featuring a historic stone building perched on a cliff. The building is partially covered in lush green ivy, with a terracotta roof contrasting against the clear blue sky. The surrounding area includes dense vegetation and a view of the ocean, with sunlight casting dynamic shadows and highlighting the natural textures of the stone and foliage. The time of day appears to be midday, with clear weather and scattered clouds enhancing the vibrant colors of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A drone POV shot.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption inaccurately describes the video's opening. The video does not show a flight \"through a dimly lit, narrow tunnel.\" Instead, it begins with a very fast, blurred backward movement *away from* an arched opening, which then reveals the wider scene. The caption also uses the speculative phrase \"appears to be midday,\" which should be stated more definitively as \"The time of day is midday.\" Additionally, subjective adjectives like \"vibrant\" and \"lush\" should be replaced with more neutral terms such as \"bright\" and \"dense\" to adhere to the instructions. The description of the transition as a \"shift\" is also slightly misleading, as it is one continuous camera movement rather than a change between separate scenes.",
