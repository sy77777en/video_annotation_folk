    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor setting with a warm, inviting atmosphere. The room features light-colored walls and a window with sheer curtains that allow soft, natural light to filter in, creating a gentle glow. The window is framed by a yellow border, adding a touch of color to the space. A patterned cushion with red and white designs is visible, suggesting a cozy, lived-in environment. The overall scene is calm and well-lit, with a focus on the interior's simple yet welcoming decor.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good for this video.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption misidentifies a partially visible red and white patterned laundry basket or storage bin as a \"cushion.\"\n*   The description of the atmosphere as \"warm, inviting,\" \"cozy,\" and \"welcoming\" is subjective. The scene has a distinct yellow-green color cast, but these descriptors are interpretations of mood, not factual observations.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption completely omits the presence of the person, who is the central subject of the shot.\n*   It fails to mention the subtitles (\"Tell me\") that appear at the bottom of the screen, which is a required overlay element.\n*   It does not describe the motion in the scene, specifically the person turning their head to the side.\n*   It neglects to mention the second yellow-framed doorway visible in the background.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violates \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":** The caption is filled with subjective words like \"inviting,\" \"gentle,\" \"cozy,\" \"calm,\" and \"welcoming.\"\n*   **Violates \"Avoid speculative statements\":** The phrase \"suggesting a cozy, lived-in environment\" is an inference, which is explicitly forbidden.\n*   **Violates \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights\":** The statement \"with a focus on the interior's simple yet welcoming decor\" is an interpretation of the scene's purpose.\n*   **Violates \"Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions\":** While the instruction is to focus on the setting, completely omitting the main subject is a significant failure in describing the scene's content.\n*   **Fails to include required elements:** The caption does not mention the point of view, motion, or overlays as instructed.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "An eye-level medium shot of a person in a hallway with light-colored walls. The person, initially seen from the back, has a reddish-brown bob haircut and is wearing a white, short-sleeved collared shirt while holding a dark object. In the background, a doorway with a yellow frame surrounds a window with sheer white curtains. Another yellow-framed doorway is on the left. The person turns their head to the left, revealing their profile and a striped tie as they appear to speak. In the lower right corner, a red and white patterned laundry basket is partially visible. White subtitles at the bottom read, \"Tell me\".",
