    "pre_caption": "The video is set indoors, featuring a dining table with a variety of dishes. The environment is dimly lit, creating a focused atmosphere on the table's contents. The table is covered with plates of food, including a dish with greens and another with a mix of ingredients, possibly noodles or rice. A glass of iced tea with a lemon slice is prominently placed, adding a refreshing element. The setting includes a person seated at the table, wearing a uniform with a name tag, suggesting a formal or professional context. The overall color scheme is warm, with earthy tones from the food and the person's attire. The scene remains consistent throughout, maintaining a steady, observational perspective.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "This is a detailed feedback on the provided caption.\n\n**Feedback:**\n\nThe provided caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions, particularly the negative constraints against speculation, subjective language, and inference. While it correctly identifies the basic setting, it misses important objective details and includes prohibited interpretations.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is generally accurate in its broad strokes (indoors, dining table, food, a person).\n*   However, the description of the food is inaccurate and speculative. It describes \"a mix of ingredients, possibly noodles or rice,\" which is a guess. The dish in front of the person is more clearly an egg and vegetable dish.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is incomplete. It omits several key, non-speculative visual details that define the scene, such as:\n    *   The stark, completely black background, which is a significant stylistic element.\n    *   The name \"SUSAN\" clearly visible on the person's name tag.\n    *   The maroon color and gold trim of the vest.\n    *   The chopsticks being held by the person.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption violates the following instructions:\n\n*   **\"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.'\"**\n    *   The phrase \"**possibly** noodles or rice\" is a direct violation of this rule.\n\n*   **\"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\"**\n    *   The phrase \"**adding a refreshing element**\" is a subjective interpretation of the iced tea's role in the scene.\n\n*   **\"Do not infer the role of the scene setting.\"**\n    *   The phrase \"**suggesting a formal or professional context**\" is an inference based on the uniform, which is explicitly forbidden.\n\n*   **\"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\"**\n    *   The phrase \"**creating a focused atmosphere** on the table's contents\" explains the *effect* of the lighting rather than simply describing the lighting itself (e.g., \"The scene is dimly lit with a spotlight on the table\").\n\nIn summary, the caption fails because it substitutes objective description with subjective interpretation, speculation, and inference, all of which are explicitly prohibited by the instructions. It also misses several prominent visual details that could have been included to create a more complete and compliant description.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A medium shot shows an East Asian woman with glasses and shoulder-length dark hair sitting at a dining table against a solid black background. She wears a white collared shirt under a maroon vest with gold trim, and a name tag on her vest reads \"SUSAN\". She holds chopsticks in her right hand over a plate of food. On the white table in front of her are several dishes, including a plate with an egg and green vegetable dish, another plate with cooked green vegetables, and a tall glass containing an amber-colored beverage with ice. The woman and the table are illuminated, while the surrounding area is dark.",
