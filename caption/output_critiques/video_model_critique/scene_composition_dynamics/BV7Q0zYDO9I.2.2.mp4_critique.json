    "pre_caption": "In a large, dimly lit room with dark wood-paneled walls, a group of humanoid figures in orange jumpsuits stands in organized rows on a dark gray checkered floor. The figures, who have pale white heads and hands, face a single wooden lectern in the foreground, where another similar figure stands. Some of the figures' heads feature black and white patterns. The scene is illuminated from above, casting shadows across the floor. An overlay of white text appears at the bottom of the scene, reading, \"Because of the 15 days of custody and thousands of\".",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed analysis of the caption provided:\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies all the key visual elements: the dimly lit room, the wood-paneled walls, the dark gray checkered floor, the humanoid figures in orange jumpsuits, their pale heads and hands, the patterned heads on some figures, and the wooden lectern. The description of the text overlay, including its content, color, and position, is also correct.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is very thorough, capturing the essential details of the setting, subjects, and props. It effectively paints a clear picture of the scene. A minor addition could be mentioning the high-angle point of view, which gives the viewer a top-down, observational perspective of the room.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres exceptionally well to the provided guidelines.\n*   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or markdown.\n*   **Tone and Language:** It uses simple, natural, and objective language, successfully avoiding emotional, subjective, or speculative statements.\n*   **Content:** It focuses on describing the visible scene, including the setting, props, and subjects, without inferring a narrative or purpose (e.g., not calling it a prison or courtroom).\n*   **Overlays:** It correctly identifies the text as an overlay and describes its properties as instructed.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is excellent. It is a well-written, accurate, and comprehensive description that follows the instructions almost perfectly. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly state the high-angle point of view to add another layer of descriptive detail.",
