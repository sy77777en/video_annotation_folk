    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an urban street scene during the day, featuring a quiet, tree-lined residential area. The setting includes brick buildings with small gardens and a sidewalk. A notable visual element is a gray car with a sleek, angular design, parked on the street. The car's metallic surface reflects the surroundings, adding a dynamic texture to the scene. The street is calm, with minimal traffic, and the lighting suggests a clear day, casting soft shadows on the pavement. The environment conveys a sense of tranquility and order, with neatly maintained surroundings and a peaceful atmosphere.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "An evaluation of the caption is as follows:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is generally accurate. It correctly identifies the setting as a daytime urban street with brick buildings, trees, and a sidewalk. The description of the car as gray with a sleek, angular design is also correct.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is incomplete. It omits several key visual elements:\n*   **Overlays:** It fails to mention the white subtitles with a black outline at the bottom of the screen, which is a required element per the instructions.\n*   **Subjects:** It does not mention the people visible inside the car, particularly the passenger in a hat leaning out the open window. The instructions state to include subjects to complement the scene.\n*   **Specific Details:** It misses specific, observable details of the car, such as the \"CX 25 Prestige\" and \"ABS\" text on the trunk, the rear spoiler, and the New York license plate \"KNC 761.\"\n*   **Background:** It does not mention the body of water and industrial-looking structures visible in the distant background.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption fails to adhere to several key instructions:\n*   **Subjective Language:** It violates the instruction to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" Phrases like \"conveys a sense of tranquility and order\" and \"peaceful atmosphere\" are subjective interpretations of the scene's mood, not objective descriptions.\n*   **Overlays:** It completely ignores the instruction to describe overlay elements like subtitles, including their content and placement.\n*   **Point of View:** The instruction to indicate the point of view if relevant was not followed. The shot is taken from a static position behind and to the side of the car.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is a static, eye-level shot from the rear passenger side, focusing on a gray car parked on an urban street during the day. The car is a hatchback with a sleek, angular design, a rear spoiler, and a New York license plate that reads \"KNC 761\". The text \"CX 25 Prestige\" and \"ABS\" is visible on the trunk. A passenger wearing a light-colored hat leans their arm out of the open rear window, while the driver can be seen in the front seat. The street is lined with brick buildings and trees. In the distant background, a body of water and part of a bridge or industrial structure are visible. At the bottom of the screen, white subtitles with a black outline read: \"character Giant, a manager for Denzel Washington's character.\"",
