    "pre_caption": "In a side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene in profile, the setting is a dark, foggy forest at night. The landscape is filled with silhouetted trees, including bare, spindly ones in the foreground and dense pines in the background, all set against a hazy, blue-tinted sky with faint light beams cutting through the mist. A thick layer of fog blankets the ground, which is dotted with patches of glowing white grass and small red plants. The camera pans from left to right as a horizontal red laser beam sweeps across the terrain. A boxy black drone with a red light flies through the scene, casting a conical red searchlight onto the ground below. An \"IGN\" logo is visible as an overlay in the bottom right corner.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene or character in profile.**\"",

It correctly identifies the side-view perspective, the dark and foggy forest setting, the time of day, and the specific visual elements like the silhouetted trees, glowing grass, red plants, red laser, and the drone with its searchlight. The description of the motion (camera pan, sweeping laser, flying drone) is also precise.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is comprehensive, covering all the key aspects requested in the instructions. It details the point of view, environment, time, weather conditions (fog), notable natural features, man-made elements (drone, laser), and the overlay.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption perfectly adheres to the provided guidelines.\n    *   It is a single, concise paragraph.\n    *   It uses simple, objective language, avoiding subjective or speculative terms.\n    *   It correctly identifies the \"IGN\" logo as an overlay and specifies its location.\n    *   It focuses on the setting and scenery rather than providing excessive detail on any characters.\n    *   It accurately describes the camera movement and the motion of elements within the scene.\n    *   It avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or phrases like \"it appears.\"\n\nThe caption is an excellent example of a well-written description that follows all instructions meticulously, resulting in a clear and informative summary of the video's content.",
