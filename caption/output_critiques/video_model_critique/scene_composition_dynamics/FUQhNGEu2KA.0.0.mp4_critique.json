    "pre_caption": "The scene is set in a long, narrow residential hallway with white walls and light-colored wood plank flooring. On the left, a closed wooden door is visible. The right wall is adorned with a few framed pictures and a white light switch. At the far end of the corridor, another doorway opens into a separate space. A woman wearing a plaid nightshirt walks from the back of the hallway toward the camera. She stops and turns to her right, looking into a doorway just as the light within that room extinguishes, revealing a dark, silhouetted figure standing in the unlit space.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good for this video. It effectively and accurately describes the scene while adhering to all the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is entirely accurate. It correctly identifies the setting as a \"long, narrow residential hallway\" with \"white walls\" and \"light-colored wood plank flooring.\" The descriptions of the \"closed wooden door,\" \"framed pictures,\" \"white light switch,\" and the woman's \"plaid nightshirt\" are all correct. Most importantly, it accurately describes the sequence of events: the woman walking, turning, the light extinguishing, and the appearance of a \"dark, silhouetted figure.\"\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe description is comprehensive. It establishes the environment first, then introduces the subject and their movement, and concludes with the pivotal action. It includes all the significant visual elements and the complete sequence of events shown in the video, leaving out no crucial information.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Objective and Factual:** The caption successfully avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (e.g., \"creepy,\" \"scary\") and speculative statements. It describes the final element as a \"dark, silhouetted figure,\" which is a purely factual observation.\n*   **Focus on Scenery and Setting:** The description begins by establishing the environment in detail before focusing on the action, as instructed. The description of the subject is concise and contextual.\n*   **Description of Motion and Change:** The caption clearly describes the woman's movement (\"walks from the back... toward the camera,\" \"stops and turns\") and the key change in the scene (\"the light within that room extinguishes, revealing a... figure\").\n*   **Formatting and Language:** It is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English. It avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame\" and does not infer the scene's purpose or genre.\n*   **Point of View:** While not explicitly stated, the description of the action (\"walks... toward the camera\") clearly implies the static, eye-level point of view. This aligns with the instruction to mention POV if relevant, without being overly technical.",
