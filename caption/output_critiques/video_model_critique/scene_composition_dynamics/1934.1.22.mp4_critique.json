    "pre_caption": "The video presents an indoor setting with a minimalist, theatrical stage design. The environment is characterized by a stark black backdrop, creating a dramatic contrast with the subject dressed in a white outfit. The subject's attire includes a cap and gloves, adding to the monochromatic theme. The stage features a raised platform and a large, rectangular element with geometric patterns on the left side, contributing to the abstract aesthetic. The lighting is bright, emphasizing the contrast between the subject and the dark background. The overall scene is devoid of additional props or furniture, focusing on the simplicity and visual impact of the contrasting colors and shapes.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"\n\nMake your output sound natural, as if written by a thoughtful human. Keep the tone conversational, clear, and professional—no stiff or overly formal language. Prioritize readability, flow, and conciseness.",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption is a good starting point, but it has several issues regarding accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption states the subject's attire adds to a \"monochromatic theme.\" This is inaccurate, as the white jumpsuit has distinct orange stripes down the arms and legs.\n*   It describes a \"large, rectangular element with geometric patterns on the left side.\" This is misleading. It is not a physical element but a screen or projection displaying the image of a control panel with switches and a dial. Describing this as just \"geometric patterns\" is vague and misses the specific content of the image.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The most significant omission is the lack of any description of motion. The instructions state to \"describe... human-made movements.\" The video clearly shows a person performing, jumping from a raised platform to the floor. This central action is entirely missing from the description.\n*   The description of the stage is incomplete. It mentions a \"raised platform\" but fails to describe it as a long, thin, white beam that spans much of the scene's width.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   The caption violates the instruction to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\" and \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\" Phrases like \"dramatic contrast,\" \"abstract aesthetic,\" and \"emphasizing the contrast\" are interpretive and should be avoided in favor of neutral, descriptive language.\n*   The caption correctly identifies the setting as an indoor, minimalist stage with a black backdrop, which follows the instructions well. It also correctly avoids referring to specific frames.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is **not good** because it contains factual inaccuracies (missing the orange stripes, misrepresenting the projection), is incomplete (omitting the primary action of the subject), and violates key negative constraints by using subjective and interpretive language. A better caption would neutrally describe the scene's components, including the projection and the subject's movement, without analyzing their aesthetic effect.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is an indoor shot of a person on a stage with a black backdrop and floor. A long, thin, white beam is positioned horizontally across the upper part of the scene. On the left, there is a projection of a control panel with several vertical switches and a circular dial. A person wearing a white cap, white gloves, and a white jumpsuit with orange stripes on the arms and legs is shown. The person starts on the white beam, then jumps down to the stage floor.",
