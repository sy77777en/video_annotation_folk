    "pre_caption": "The video presents an abstract scene with a focus on vibrant colors and fluid motion. It begins with a bright, light-filled background that transitions into a dynamic display of swirling yellow ink.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good for this video.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is mostly accurate in its description of the visual elements. It correctly identifies the abstract nature of the scene, the vibrant yellow color, the fluid motion, and the cloud-like shapes of the ink. However, the phrase \"a bright, light-filled background that transitions into a dynamic display of swirling yellow ink\" is inaccurate. The background does not transition; it remains a constant white backdrop into which the yellow ink is introduced.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is incomplete. While it describes the ink's general appearance, it misses a key part of the action: the ink is introduced from two opposite sides of the screen and moves toward the center to collide and mix. This directional movement is a primary feature of the video's composition and progression.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption fails to adhere to several key instructions:\n*   **Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives:** The caption uses interpretive and subjective language such as \"dynamic display,\" \"intricate,\" and \"visual spectacle.\"\n*   **Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights:** The caption violates this rule multiple times with phrases like \"emphasizing the visual spectacle of the ink's texture and flow\" and \"highlighting the contrast and fluidity of the scene.\" These statements explain the *effect* of the visuals rather than simply describing them.\n*   **Avoid speculative or interpretive statements:** The phrase \"creating a sense of movement and transformation\" is an interpretation of the visual effect on the viewer, not a direct description of the action itself.\n*   **Use simple, natural English:** While readable, phrases like \"dynamic display\" are more elaborate than necessary. The instructions call for simple, direct description.\n\nIn summary, the caption is too interpretive and explanatory, violating the core instructions to provide a purely objective and descriptive account of the scene. It also misses a key detail about the motion of the ink.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is an abstract, slow-motion shot of yellow ink in a liquid against a white background. Two streams of ink are introduced from the left and right edges of the frame. They travel horizontally toward the center, where they meet and collide. Upon impact, the ink billows and expands into thick, puffy plumes, continuing to swirl and mix in the center of the screen.",
