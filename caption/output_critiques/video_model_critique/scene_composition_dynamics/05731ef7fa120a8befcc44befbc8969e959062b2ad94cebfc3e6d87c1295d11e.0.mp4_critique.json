    "pre_caption": "The video presents an abstract scene with a focus on vibrant colors and fluid motion. It begins with a bright, light-filled background that transitions into a dynamic display of swirling yellow ink. The ink forms intricate, cloud-like shapes, creating a sense of movement and transformation. The setting is undefined, emphasizing the visual spectacle of the ink's texture and flow. The overall atmosphere is bright and vivid, with the yellow ink standing out against the lighter backdrop, highlighting the contrast and fluidity of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains subjective and interpretive language, such as \"vibrant,\" \"dynamic display,\" \"creating a sense of movement and transformation,\" \"emphasizing the visual spectacle,\" and \"highlighting the contrast,\" which should be removed. The description of the motion is also inaccurate; the background does not \"transition into\" the ink. Instead, two separate streams of ink are introduced from opposite sides of the screen. The caption omits the key detail that the ink enters from both the left and right before merging in the center. To improve, the description should be rewritten to objectively state that from a static, straight-on perspective, two streams of bright yellow ink are injected from the left and right sides into a clear liquid against a white background. The ink should be described as billowing in slow motion, forming cloud-like plumes that expand and merge in the center.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a static, straight-on perspective, two streams of bright yellow ink are injected into a clear liquid against a white background. One stream enters from the left side of the screen and the other from the right. In slow motion, the ink billows, forming cloud-like plumes that expand towards the center. The two plumes then merge, creating a single, large formation of yellow ink that fills the middle of the frame.",
