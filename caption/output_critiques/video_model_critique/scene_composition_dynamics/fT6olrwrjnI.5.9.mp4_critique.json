    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an intense scene featuring a character in a dynamic pose, set against a stark, minimalistic background. The environment is undefined, with a focus on the character who is wearing a black and white sports uniform with the number 18. Red, lightning-like energy surrounds the character, adding a sense of motion and intensity. The character's expression and posture suggest action, with the red energy providing a vivid contrast to the otherwise monochrome setting. The scene is captured from an objective point of view, emphasizing the character's centrality and the dramatic visual elements.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains subjective and interpretive language, which is against the instructions. Phrases like \"intense scene,\" \"adding a sense of motion and intensity,\" and \"emphasizing the character's centrality and the dramatic visual elements\" should be removed as they explain the effect on the viewer or the purpose of the visual elements. The point of view is described as \"objective,\" but a more specific and accurate description would be a \"low-angle shot,\" which better captures how the scene is framed. Additionally, the caption fails to mention the Japanese subtitles that appear as an overlay at the bottom of the screen. The description of the uniform as a \"sports uniform\" is vague; specifying it as a \"sleeveless jersey with black vertical stripes\" would be more precise.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is a close-up, low-angle shot of an anime character with spiky black hair and glowing red eyes. He is leaning forward with a fierce expression, his teeth gritted and fists clenched. He wears a white, sleeveless jersey with black vertical stripes and the number 18 on the chest, over a dark long-sleeved shirt. Red, vein-like energy emanates from and surrounds his body against a plain white background. At the bottom of the screen, Japanese subtitles are overlaid on the image.",
