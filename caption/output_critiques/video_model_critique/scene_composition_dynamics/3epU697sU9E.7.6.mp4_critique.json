    "pre_caption": "This indoor scene takes place in a narrow room with blue-gray walls and light-colored, patterned carpeting. A man in a dark suit stands behind a wooden lectern, addressing a crowd of people holding cameras and microphones. In the foreground, a woman in a white shirt extends a boom microphone toward the speaker. To the right, an American flag stands prominently next to a wall adorned with a series of framed portraits. Another dark flag is positioned behind the lectern. The overall lighting is dim, casting a cool, greenish-blue tint over the entire room.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on the instructions.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the key elements of the scene: the indoor setting, the narrowness of the room, the colors of the walls and carpet, the wooden lectern, the presence and placement of the American and other flags, the framed portraits, and the distinct cool, greenish-blue color tint. The descriptions of the subjects (the man at the lectern, the crowd, the woman with the microphone) are also precise and fact-based.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is mostly complete but is missing one crucial element required by the instructions. It fails to mention the white subtitles that appear as an overlay at the bottom of the screen. The instructions explicitly state to describe overlay elements, including their content and placement.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths:** The caption successfully adheres to most of the instructions. It provides a concise, objective, and informative description of the setting. It avoids emotional language, speculation, and terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" It correctly focuses on the scenery and environment over detailed subject descriptions. The paragraph is well-structured and coherent.\n*   **Weaknesses:** The primary failure is the omission of the overlay text. The instructions clearly state: \"If the video contains overlay elements such as... subtitles, captions... specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\" This is a significant deviation from the guidelines.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe caption is very well-written in terms of its descriptive quality, objectivity, and adherence to the general tone and style requested. However, it is incomplete because it completely overlooks the overlay subtitles, which is a specific and important requirement of the provided instructions.",
