    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor setting with a relaxed atmosphere, likely a living room. A person is lying on a brown leather couch, with their feet prominently in the foreground. The feet are adorned with colorful, shiny confetti, adding a playful element to the scene. In the background, there are green plants, suggesting a cozy and natural environment. The lighting is soft and natural, indicating daytime, with light filtering through a window. The overall composition is calm and casual, focusing on the contrast between the textured leather couch and the sparkling confetti.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good. It fails to adhere to several key negative constraints outlined in the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is mostly accurate in its description of the core elements: an indoor setting, a person on a brown couch, feet in the foreground covered in shiny particles, green plants in the background, and natural daytime lighting.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption fails to mention the prominent black bars on the left and right sides, which frame the vertical video.\n*   It omits the motion in the scene, where the feet are wiggling and flexing.\n*   It describes the particles as \"colorful, shiny confetti\" but could be more specific by mentioning the visible pink, purple, and gold colors.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption violates several explicit instructions:\n\n*   **Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives:** The caption uses \"relaxed atmosphere,\" \"playful element,\" \"cozy environment,\" and \"calm and casual\" composition. These are all subjective interpretations of the scene's mood, which is forbidden.\n*   **Avoid speculative statements:** The caption uses \"likely a living room\" and \"suggesting a cozy and natural environment.\" The instructions prohibit speculation (e.g., \"likely,\" \"suggesting,\" \"appears\"). You should only describe what is visibly present.\n*   **Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights:** The caption states the composition is \"focusing on the contrast between the textured leather couch and the sparkling confetti.\" This explains the artistic focus, which is explicitly disallowed.\n*   **Do not infer the role of the scene setting:** The phrase \"adding a playful element to the scene\" infers a purpose or effect, which is against the rules.\n\nIn summary, while the caption captures the basic content, it heavily relies on subjective language, speculation, and interpretation of artistic intent, directly contradicting the core requirements of the instructions. A good caption would stick strictly to objective, factual descriptions of the visible elements and their motion.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A vertically oriented video is centered between two black bars on the left and right. The shot is a close-up of a person's feet in the foreground. The soles of the feet are covered in pink, purple, and gold glitter. The person, who is lying on their back on a brown couch, is out of focus in the background. Throughout the video, the person wiggles and flexes their toes and feet. In the background, out-of-focus green potted plants are visible in a brightly lit room.",
