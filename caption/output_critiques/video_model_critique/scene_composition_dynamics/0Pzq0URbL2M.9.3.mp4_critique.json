    "pre_caption": "The video presents an outdoor setting viewed from an objective perspective, focusing on a circular pit in the ground. The environment is earthy, with the ground appearing dark brown and textured, suggesting soil or dirt. The time of day is indeterminate due to the lack of natural light cues. The scene features a notable visual element: a person in a white shirt positioned at the edge of the pit, emphasizing the contrast between the dark interior and the lighter clothing. The setting is minimalistic, with no additional architectural or natural features visible. Overlay elements include small text in the bottom left corner, which is not part of the scene itself.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The description of the point of view as an \"objective perspective\" is too general; \"top-down\" or \"bird's-eye view\" would be more precise. The description of the overlay element is factually incorrect. The caption claims there is text displaying \"[8,12]\" in the bottom left corner, but the video actually features subtitles at the bottom of the screen that read, \"contaminate wells and water sources with cholera.\"",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video presents an outdoor setting from a top-down, bird's-eye perspective, centered on a dark, circular pit in the ground. The environment is earthy, with the ground appearing as dark brown, textured soil or dirt. The scene is dimly lit, with a spotlight illuminating the immediate area around the pit, leaving the wider surroundings in darkness. Two people, both wearing white, stand on opposite sides of the pit's edge. Their light clothing creates a stark visual contrast against the dark ground and the blackness of the pit. The setting is minimalistic, drawing the viewer's full attention to the central action. Subtitles appear at the bottom of the screen, reading, \"contaminate wells and water sources with cholera.\"",
