The environment has a cozy, intimate feel, with soft lighting that casts gentle shadows. The setting includes decorative plates mounted on the wall, adding a touch of homeliness.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "An evaluation of the caption is as follows:\n\n**Accuracy:** The description of the physical setting is accurate. The scene is indeed an indoor, warmly lit room with patterned wallpaper, framed art, and decorative plates.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is incomplete. It entirely omits the presence of the person who is the central focus of the shot. The instructions state, \"If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail,\" which implies they should be mentioned, not ignored. The caption also fails to describe the point of view (a medium close-up shot).\n\n**Adherence to the Instruction:**\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":** The caption uses subjective terms like \"cozy, intimate feel\" and \"homeliness.\" The instructions explicitly forbid using such emotional or interpretive language.\n*   **Partial Adherence to Subject Description:** While the instructions ask to \"Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions,\" the caption incorrectly interprets this as omitting the subject altogether. A brief, objective mention of the person's presence is necessary for a complete scene description.\n*   **Good Adherence:** The caption correctly identifies the setting as indoors, notes the indeterminate time of day, describes the static nature of the scene, and avoids speculation or referring to specific frames.\n\nIn summary, the caption accurately describes the background elements but fails to adhere to key instructions by using subjective language and completely omitting the main subject of the video.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A medium close-up shot shows an East Asian woman with dark hair and glasses, wearing a teal hooded top. She is in a warmly lit room with patterned wallpaper. In the background, a framed picture hangs on the wall, and decorative plates are mounted nearby. The indoor scene remains static throughout the video, and the time of day is indeterminate.",
