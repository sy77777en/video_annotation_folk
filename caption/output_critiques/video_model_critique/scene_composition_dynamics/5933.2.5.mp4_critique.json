    "pre_caption": "The video captures an outdoor setting during daylight, featuring a close-up view of a hand sketching on a small notepad. The notepad is held by another hand, and the sketch depicts a simple structure, possibly a building or tower, drawn with a dark pen. The background is blurred, suggesting a natural environment, possibly with earthy tones. The focus remains on the notepad and the sketching process, highlighting the texture of the paper and the movement of the pen. The scene maintains a neutral, observational perspective, emphasizing the act of drawing in a serene outdoor setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "An evaluation of the caption is as follows:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is accurate in its description of the main visual elements. It correctly identifies the outdoor, daylight setting, the close-up on the hands, the act of sketching on a notepad, the nature of the sketch as a structure, and the blurred background.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is incomplete. It fails to mention the white subtitle text overlay at the bottom of the screen, which is a visible element. The instructions specifically require the description of overlays such as \"subtitles, captions.\"\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption does not fully adhere to the provided instructions in several key areas:\n*   **Avoid speculative statements:** The caption uses the word \"possibly\" twice (\"possibly a building or tower,\" \"possibly with earthy tones\"), which is a form of speculation that the instructions advise against.\n*   **Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives:** The use of the word \"serene\" to describe the setting is subjective and emotional, violating the instruction to avoid such language.\n*   **Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights:** The phrase \"emphasizing the act of drawing\" directly contradicts this instruction.\n*   **Describe overlays:** As mentioned under \"Completeness,\" the caption omits the description of the subtitles, which is a required element according to the instructions.\n\nIn summary, while the caption accurately captures the basic action, it fails on completeness by omitting the text overlay and violates several negative constraints, including the rules against speculation, subjective language, and explaining the scene's emphasis.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is a close-up, outdoor shot in daylight of a person sketching on a small notepad. One hand holds the spiral-bound, lined notepad steady. The other hand uses a light-colored pen with a fine black tip to draw a tall, thin structure inside a rectangular border. The background is out of focus. White subtitles are visible at the bottom of the screen.",
