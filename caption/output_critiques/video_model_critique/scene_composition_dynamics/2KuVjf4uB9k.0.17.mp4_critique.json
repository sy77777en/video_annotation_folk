    "pre_caption": "The video, captured from a drone POV, showcases a dynamic scene set on a winding desert road. The environment is arid, with sparse vegetation and sandy terrain surrounding the asphalt. The time of day appears to be midday, with clear skies and bright sunlight casting sharp shadows. A red car is prominently featured, drifting around the curves of the road, creating plumes of smoke that trail behind it. The motion of the car and the dust it kicks up emphasize the speed and agility of the vehicle as it navigates the barren landscape. The drone's perspective provides a sweeping view of the scene, highlighting the contrast between the smooth road and the rugged desert backdrop.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A drone POV shot.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good for this video.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is mostly accurate in its description of the scene. However, it incorrectly states the car is kicking up \"dust\" when the prominent plumes are tire smoke from drifting on asphalt. While some dust from the road's edge might be disturbed, the primary visual is smoke.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is reasonably complete, covering the point of view, environment, time of day, and the primary action. It successfully provides a general overview of the video's content.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption fails to adhere to several key negative constraints outlined in the instructions:\n\n*   **Violation:** The caption uses the phrase \"The motion of the car and the dust it kicks up emphasize the speed and agility of the vehicle...\" and \"The drone's perspective... highlighting the contrast...\". This directly violates the instruction: \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\"\n*   **Violation:** The caption uses the speculative phrase \"appears to be midday,\" which goes against the instruction: \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.'\"\n*   **Violation:** By stating the scene emphasizes the car's \"speed and agility,\" the caption infers a purpose for the setting (a place to test the car), which violates the rule: \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting.\"\n\nIn summary, while the caption accurately describes the basic visual elements, it fails by including subjective interpretation and analysis of the scene's effect on the viewer, which was explicitly forbidden by the instructions. It also uses speculative language, which was to be avoided.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "An aerial shot follows a red car as it drifts around a curve on a winding asphalt road. The car creates thick plumes of white smoke from its tires as it slides. The road is situated in a hilly, arid landscape with sparse vegetation and sandy-colored soil. The scene takes place during the daytime under a clear sky, with bright sunlight casting a shadow of the car.",
