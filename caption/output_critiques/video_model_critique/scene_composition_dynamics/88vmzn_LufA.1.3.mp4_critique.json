    "pre_caption": "The video is set on a paved city street during daylight hours, bordered by modern buildings featuring large glass windows. A long, black limousine, distinguished by US and Presidential flags on its front fenders and a seal on the rear door, is shown driving along the road.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good for the video.\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is accurate. It correctly identifies the setting as a paved city street with modern buildings, the time as daylight, and the subjects as a black limousine and a black SUV. The descriptions of the vehicles, including the flags, seal, and emergency light bar, are also correct.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is incomplete. The video includes audio narration (\"The remote trigger didn't work. And that is because...\"), which is a significant element of the scene. The instructions do not explicitly forbid mentioning audio, but a complete description should ideally account for all sensory information presented. More importantly, the video is a 3D animation, not a real-life recording. This is a crucial detail about the visual style and nature of the content that is omitted.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption fails to adhere to the instructions in the following ways:\n- It does not describe the style of the scene. The video is clearly a computer-generated animation, a key stylistic feature that should be mentioned.\n- It does not describe the point of view, which is a side-tracking shot that moves along with the vehicles.\n- The final sentence, \"Both vehicles are depicted in motion within this urban environment,\" is redundant as the preceding sentences already establish that the vehicles are \"driving\" and \"traveling.\"\n\nIn summary, the caption accurately describes the basic objects and actions but fails to capture the animated style of the video and omits key details like the point of view and the presence of audio narration, while also including a redundant final sentence.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a 3D animated scene, a side-tracking shot follows a motorcade down a sunlit city street lined with modern buildings. A long, black presidential limousine, featuring the American flag and the presidential flag on its front fenders, drives past. It is followed by a black SUV with a red emergency light bar on its roof. Throughout the scene, a narrator's voice states, \"The remote trigger didn't work.\"",
