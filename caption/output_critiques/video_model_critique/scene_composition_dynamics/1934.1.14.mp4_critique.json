    "pre_caption": "The video takes place indoors, featuring a minimalist setting with plain, light-colored walls. A person is present, wearing a white outfit with orange stripes and a hood, standing near a large, white, rectangular object with metallic controls. The environment is clean and uncluttered, emphasizing the stark contrast between the white attire and the surrounding neutral tones. The lighting is bright and even, suggesting an artificial indoor light source. The scene remains static, focusing on the interaction between the person and the object, with no visible changes in time or motion.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good for this video. It contains inaccuracies and violates several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is inaccurate when it states, \"The scene remains static... with no visible changes in time or motion.\" The video clearly shows the person moving their hands down from their face and their facial expression changing from one of calling out to one of shock or surprise. This motion is a central element of the clip.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption fails to describe the motion mentioned above, which is a significant omission.\n*   It omits notable details of the person's attire, such as the white gloves and the white headphones or goggles worn over the hood.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violation of \"Describe motion\":** The instruction states, \"If the scene involves motion or changes, describe... human-made movements.\" The caption fails to do this and incorrectly claims the scene is static.\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid interpretation\":** The caption uses interpretive language forbidden by the instructions. Phrases like \"emphasizing the stark contrast\" and \"focusing on the interaction between the person and the object\" explain the *effect* or *purpose* of the scene's composition, rather than just describing what is visually present.\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid speculation\":** The phrase \"suggesting an artificial indoor light source\" is a minor inference. While likely correct, the instructions ask to avoid speculative language and describe only what is visible. A better description would be to simply state that the lighting is \"bright and even.\"",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A woman with short brown hair is shown from the chest up in a room with plain, light-colored walls. She wears a white hooded outfit with orange stripes on the shoulders, white gloves, and white headphones over the hood. To her right is a white rectangular object with a black panel that has a silver knob and several vertical switches. At the start of the clip, the woman has her hands cupped around her mouth. She then lowers her hands, and her facial expression changes to one of wide-eyed shock. The lighting is bright and even throughout the scene.",
