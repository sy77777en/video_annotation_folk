    "pre_caption": "The video, captured from a drone POV, presents an aerial view of an urban environment at sunset. The setting is outdoors, featuring a tall, modern building with a red brick facade and numerous balconies. The building's glass windows reflect the warm hues of the sunset, creating a striking contrast with the sky's gradient of orange and blue. Below, a parking structure and other cityscape elements are visible, indicating a bustling urban area. The scene transitions smoothly, maintaining focus on the architectural details and the expansive view of the city skyline, enhanced by the soft, ambient light of the setting sun.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A drone POV showing an aerial view.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is a good attempt at describing the scene, but it contains significant inaccuracies and fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **Incorrect:** The most significant error is the statement: \"The scene transitions smoothly...\" This video does not contain any scene transitions. It is a single, continuous shot where the camera is in motion. The caption incorrectly uses the term \"transition\" to describe camera movement.\n*   **Partially Accurate:** The description of the sky as a \"gradient of orange and blue\" is a slight oversimplification. The upper part of the sky has a distinct greenish-teal color, not blue.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   **Omission:** The caption fails to mention the prominent fisheye or wide-angle lens distortion. This effect is a defining visual characteristic of the video, causing the tall building and horizon to appear curved, and it should be included.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violation (Inference):** The phrase \"...indicating a bustling urban area\" is an inference. The instructions explicitly state, \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting.\" While the presence of buildings suggests a city, the video itself does not show any \"bustling\" activity to support this conclusion.\n*   **Violation (Subjective Language):** The use of \"striking contrast\" is a subjective adjective. The instructions state, \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\"\n*   **Violation (Scene Transitions):** The instructions say to describe scene transitions *if they occur*. By inventing a transition that isn't there, the caption fails to follow this directive accurately.\n\nIn summary, while the caption correctly identifies the POV, the main subject (building), and the time of day, it is critically flawed by its inaccurate description of a non-existent scene transition, its use of inference and subjective language, and its omission of the significant lens distortion effect.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a drone's point-of-view, the camera moves alongside a tall, modern building during sunset. A prominent wide-angle or fisheye lens effect distorts the perspective, causing the building and the horizon to appear curved. The building features a red brick facade, glass windows, and multiple balconies. The sky displays a bright orange and yellow glow at the horizon, which transitions to a greenish-teal color higher up. The building's windows reflect the colors of the sunset. Below and in the distance, the top of a parking structure and other elements of a cityscape are visible.",
