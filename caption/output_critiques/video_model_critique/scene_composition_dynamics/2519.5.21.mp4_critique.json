    "pre_caption": "The video presents an indoor setting with an over-the-shoulder point of view, focusing on a room with warm lighting. The environment is intimate, featuring a neutral-colored wall and a framed picture in the background. The lighting suggests a cozy, possibly evening time. The scene includes two subjects, with one facing away from the camera, allowing a view of their upper body and the room ahead. The subjects are engaged in a moment of interaction, adding a sense of personal connection to the setting. The overall atmosphere is calm and focused, with no significant movement or changes in the environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind the character, showing their upper body and the scene ahead.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is factually accurate. It correctly identifies the indoor setting, the over-the-shoulder point of view, the warm lighting, the neutral-colored wall, the framed picture, and the presence of two subjects.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption covers the essential visual elements of the scene. It establishes the environment and the general composition effectively.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption fails to adhere to several key negative constraints in the instructions.\n\n*   **Use of Subjective/Emotional Adjectives:** The instructions state to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The caption violates this rule by using words like \"intimate,\" \"cozy,\" \"calm,\" and \"focused.\" These words describe a feeling or atmosphere rather than objective visual information.\n*   **Use of Speculative Language:** The instructions explicitly forbid speculative statements like \"'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'.\" The caption uses the word \"possibly\" (\"possibly evening time\"), which is a form of speculation.\n*   **Inference and Interpretation:** The instructions state, \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\" The phrase \"adding a sense of personal connection to the setting\" is an interpretation of the scene's emotional impact and purpose, which is explicitly disallowed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is **not good** because it violates multiple core instructions. While it accurately describes the basic visual components, it heavily relies on subjective, speculative, and interpretive language, which the instructions strictly prohibit. A better caption would stick to objective descriptions of the physical environment and the subjects' placement without inferring mood, time, or emotional context.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In an indoor setting with warm lighting, the camera is positioned over the shoulder of a person on the right. The shot focuses on an older man with graying hair wearing a green sweater. He initially looks down before raising his head to look at the person in the foreground. A plain wall with a framed picture is visible in the background.",
