    "pre_caption": "The video shows an outdoor scene set during the day. It features a body of calm, murky water reflecting the surroundings. Along the edge of the water is a steep, eroded dirt bank with exposed soil layers. Dry, brown, and some green grassy vegetation grows along the top edge and sparsely down the bank. A large, white bird with a long neck and a yellow beak stands in the shallow water near the bank, its reflection visible on the water's surface. The lighting suggests it is daytime.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is good, but it could be improved. Here is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly describes the outdoor daytime setting, the calm, murky water with reflections, the steep, eroded dirt bank, the type and location of the vegetation, and the physical characteristics of the bird (large, white, long neck, yellow beak) and its position in the water.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is mostly complete but misses a couple of details mentioned in the instructions:\n*   **Motion:** The caption states the bird \"stands in the shallow water,\" but the video shows the bird actively and slowly wading or stalking along the bank. Describing this movement would make the caption more dynamic and complete.\n*   **Point of View:** The instruction asks to mention the point of view if relevant. The scene is captured from a static, eye-level perspective from across the water, which could be briefly mentioned to orient the viewer.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths:** The caption successfully follows most of the key instructions. It is a single, coherent paragraph, uses simple and objective language, and avoids speculation, emotional adjectives, and inferring the scene's purpose. It correctly focuses on the setting and scenery while providing just enough detail about the subject to place it in context.\n*   **Areas for Improvement:** The caption could better adhere to the instruction to \"describe motion or changes\" by noting the bird's slow walk. It also omits the point of view, which is a requested element.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is good because it is accurate and follows the core principles of the instructions. However, it could be rated as **excellent** by incorporating the bird's slow movement and mentioning the static, eye-level point of view for a more comprehensive description.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a static, eye-level perspective across a body of water, this outdoor daytime scene features calm, murky water reflecting the surroundings. Along the far edge of the water is a steep, eroded dirt bank with exposed soil layers, topped with dry, brown, and some green grassy vegetation. A large, white bird with a long neck and a yellow beak slowly wades through the shallow water near the bank, its reflection visible on the surface as it stalks along the edge.",
