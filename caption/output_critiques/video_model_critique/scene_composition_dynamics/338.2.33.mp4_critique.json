    "pre_caption": "The video captures an indoor setting within a warmly lit restaurant, characterized by intricate, circular wooden archways with ornate carvings. The environment is bustling, with blurred figures in the background suggesting movement and activity. The lighting is soft and ambient, casting a cozy glow over the scene. A table is prominently featured in the foreground, set with a neatly folded napkin and simple tableware. The overall atmosphere is inviting, with rich, warm colors and detailed decor contributing to a sense of elegance and cultural richness.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work. The caption is well-written and captures the key visual elements of the scene. However, there are a few areas where it deviates from the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of your caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description of the scene as a \"warmly lit restaurant,\" the \"intricate, circular wooden archways with ornate carvings,\" the \"blurred figures in the background,\" and the \"table...in the foreground\" is entirely accurate.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully focuses on the setting and scenery rather than the subject, as instructed.\n*   It correctly identifies the key architectural features and the general activity in the background.\n*   It omits the point of view (an eye-level, static shot), which is a minor detail but was requested if relevant.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violation:** The primary issue is the use of subjective and interpretive language. The instructions state, \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\" and \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\"\n    *   Words like \"cozy,\" \"inviting,\" \"elegance,\" and \"cultural richness\" are subjective interpretations of the atmosphere.\n    *   The phrase \"contributing to a sense of elegance and cultural richness\" explains the effect of the decor, which is a form of analysis that the instructions prohibit.\n*   **Adherence:** The caption correctly avoids speculative language, describes motion in the background, and is presented as a single, coherent paragraph.\n\n**Overall Feedback:**\nThe caption is factually correct and provides a good visual summary. Its main weakness is the failure to adhere to the negative constraints regarding subjectivity and interpretation. By describing the atmosphere as \"cozy\" and \"inviting\" and inferring \"elegance,\" the caption goes beyond objective description and into the realm of analysis, which the instructions specifically forbid. To improve, the description should be revised to use only neutral, descriptive language.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is an eye-level, static shot of an indoor restaurant. The background is framed by large, circular wooden archways with red and gold carved patterns. Through these archways, out-of-focus figures of people can be seen moving around a counter area. The scene is illuminated by overhead lights, casting a yellow and orange hue. In the foreground, a table is covered with a white tablecloth and set with a plate holding a folded pink napkin.",
