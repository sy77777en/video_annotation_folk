    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an outdoor nighttime scene featuring an airplane approaching a runway. The setting is an airport, with the aircraft centrally positioned, viewed from behind as it descends towards the illuminated landing strip. The runway is marked by bright lights that contrast with the surrounding darkness, highlighting its path. Adjacent to the runway, airport buildings are visible, characterized by their structured layout and subtle lighting. The airplane is white, with a sleek, aerodynamic shape, and its engines and tail are clearly defined against the night sky. The scene captures the motion of the aircraft as it nears the ground, emphasizing the structured environment of the airport at night.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

The description of the runway lights as just \"bright\" is too general; they are specifically green and white. Additionally, the final sentence, \"emphasizing the structured environment of the airport at night,\" and the phrase \"highlighting its path\" are interpretive and should be removed, as the instructions state not to explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is an outdoor, nighttime view of an airplane approaching an airport runway for landing. The white, sleek aircraft is seen from behind, its engines and tail defined against the black sky as it descends. Below, the airport is dark except for the illuminated runway and adjacent buildings. A semi-transparent green overlay covers the runway and nearby taxiways. The runway is marked with bright green and white lights. To the side, airport buildings with a structured layout are subtly lit. The aircraft continues its descent toward the ground.",
