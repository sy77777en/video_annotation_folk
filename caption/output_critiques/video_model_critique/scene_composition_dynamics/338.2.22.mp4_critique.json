    "pre_caption": "The video presents a third-person over-the-hip POV shot showing a character from waist height in an indoor setting, specifically a bustling restaurant. The environment features warm lighting with intricate wooden paneling and decorative elements on the walls, creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere. The ceiling is adorned with ornate designs, adding to the restaurant's traditional aesthetic. Tables are arranged throughout the space, occupied by patrons engaged in conversation and dining. The character, wearing a blue backpack and a white shirt, moves through the scene, interacting with the lively surroundings. The time of day is not explicitly indicated, but the indoor lighting suggests a well-lit, possibly evening setting. The overall ambiance is vibrant, with a mix of people and activity contributing to the dynamic scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A third-person over-the-hip POV shot showing a character from waist height**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good for this video. While it accurately captures some visual elements, it fails to adhere to several key negative constraints in the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description of the scene as a \"bustling restaurant\" with \"warm lighting,\" \"intricate wooden paneling,\" and \"ornate designs\" on the ceiling is accurate.\n*   The description of the point of view as \"third-person over-the-hip\" is a reasonable interpretation, although a simpler \"third-person tracking shot from behind\" would also be accurate.\n*   Describing the item on the character's back as a \"blue backpack\" is a plausible interpretation, though it could also be a vest.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully covers the main aspects of the scene, including the setting, environment, key visual details, and the presence and movement of people.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption violates several explicit instructions:\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":** The caption uses subjective words like \"cozy,\" \"inviting,\" \"vibrant,\" and \"dynamic.\" The instructions require objective descriptions.\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid speculative statements\":** The phrase \"possibly evening setting\" is speculative and directly contradicts the instruction to avoid uncertainty.\n*   **Violation of \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights\":** Phrases like \"creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere\" and \"contributing to the dynamic scene\" are interpretive and explain the *effect* of the visual elements rather than just describing them.\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid inferring or interpreting\":** The statement \"adding to the restaurant's traditional aesthetic\" is an interpretation of the decor's style. The phrase \"interacting with the lively surroundings\" is an interpretation of the character's action; they are simply walking through the space.\n*   **Violation of \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without... introductory text\":** The caption begins with \"The video presents...\", which is unnecessary introductory phrasing. The description should start directly with the scene's details.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A third-person shot follows a person with long, dark hair in a ponytail from behind as they walk through a restaurant. The person wears a white shirt and a blue and maroon vest. The restaurant is filled with patrons sitting at round tables with white tablecloths. The interior features dark wood paneling, carved screens, and a decorative, coffered ceiling with light fixtures. Other people, including staff in red shirts, move around the room as diners eat and talk at their tables.",
