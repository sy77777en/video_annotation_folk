    "pre_caption": "The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, set in a vibrant barbershop. The environment is indoors, featuring a checkered black-and-white floor and walls adorned with mirrors and shelves. Neon lights in warm tones add a colorful glow to the scene. The setting is lively, with a focus on a person in a bright red sweater standing in front of the viewer. The person’s expression changes, indicating interaction. The viewer's hands are visible, holding a comb and scissors, suggesting a haircut in progress. The overall atmosphere is dynamic and engaging, with a clear focus on the barbershop's bustling activity.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good because it violates several key instructions.\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description is mostly accurate but incomplete. It correctly identifies the first-person POV, the indoor barbershop setting, the checkered floor, and the main subject. However, it describes the neon lights as being in \"warm tones,\" which is only partially true; the scene also features prominent cool-toned teal and blue neon lighting.\n*   **Completeness:** The caption misses some specific details that would enhance the description, such as the distressed texture of the red sweater, the specific colors of the comb (light blue/green) and scissors (pink), and the strong teal color cast of the overall lighting.\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption fails to adhere to several negative constraints:\n    *   **Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives:** The caption uses multiple subjective words like \"vibrant,\" \"lively,\" \"dynamic,\" and \"engaging\" to describe the scene and atmosphere, which is explicitly forbidden.\n    *   **Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights:** The caption states, \"...with a clear focus on the barbershop's bustling activity,\" which is an interpretation of the scene's emphasis rather than a neutral description.\n    *   **Do not infer the role of the scene setting:** While \"barbershop\" is a reasonable inference, the phrase \"suggesting a haircut in progress\" is an interpretation of the action, which should be avoided in favor of describing only what is visible (hands holding a comb and scissors).\n    *   **Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain:** The phrase \"indicating interaction\" is an inference about the character's expression rather than a direct description of it (e.g., \"the person's mouth is open\").",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A first-person point-of-view shot inside a room with a black-and-white checkered floor and walls. A person with an afro hairstyle, wearing a distressed red sweater and a gold chain necklace, stands in the center with their mouth open. In the foreground, two hands are visible; the left hand holds a light blue-green comb, and the right hand holds a pair of pink scissors. The room is illuminated by a mix of teal and orange neon lights, with mirrors and shelves on the walls. The overall lighting casts a strong teal hue on the scene.",
