    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor setting resembling a modern, industrial-style loft with a skateboarding theme. The environment features a wooden ramp prominently placed in the center, surrounded by various skateboards mounted on the walls. The space is illuminated by natural light streaming through large windows, casting shadows and creating a warm ambiance. The interior includes eclectic elements such as neon signs and a mix of furniture, contributing to a creative and urban atmosphere. The time of day appears to be late afternoon, as indicated by the angle and quality of the light. The scene remains consistent throughout, maintaining a focus on the unique combination of skate culture and contemporary design.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption.\n\n### Feedback\n\nThe caption is a good starting point but has several significant deviations from the instructions regarding accuracy, completeness, and adherence to specific negative constraints.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is generally accurate in identifying the setting as an industrial-style loft with a skateboarding theme, a wooden ramp, and skateboards on the wall.\n*   It is inaccurate in stating the light comes from \"large windows.\" The visible light source is a large, grated skylight in the ceiling.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is incomplete. It omits several prominent visual details that are essential for a full description of the scene:\n    *   It fails to mention the large, out-of-focus green object in the foreground, which frames the right side of the shot and establishes a specific point of view.\n    *   It does not describe the metal grate flooring in the foreground or the matching grated ceiling structure.\n    *   It mentions a \"neon sign\" but omits its content (\"BRING ON THE NIGHT\") and color (blue).\n    *   It fails to describe the motion within the scene: a slow camera push-in and a small, disc-shaped object that flies across the top of the frame.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violates \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":** The caption uses subjective terms like \"warm ambiance,\" \"eclectic elements,\" and \"creative and urban atmosphere.\"\n*   **Violates \"Avoid speculative statements\":** The caption uses the forbidden phrase \"appears to be\" when describing the time of day.\n*   **Violates \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights\":** The final sentence, \"maintaining a focus on the unique combination of skate culture and contemporary design,\" is an interpretive analysis of the scene's theme, which is explicitly forbidden.\n*   **Violates \"Describe motion or changes\":** The caption incorrectly states \"The scene remains consistent throughout,\" failing to describe the subtle camera movement and the flying object.\n*   **Fails to describe Point of View:** The instruction asks to indicate the POV if relevant. The shot is framed by a large foreground object, creating a distinct perspective that is not mentioned.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The scene is viewed from a perspective partially obscured by a large, out-of-focus green object on the right side of the frame. The setting is an indoor, industrial-style space with metal grate flooring in the foreground. In the center is a wooden skateboard ramp. Sunlight streams down from a large, grated skylight in the ceiling, casting long shadows.\n\nIn the background, a person with short, light-colored hair stands on a skateboard at the top of the ramp. To their left, a blue neon sign on the wall reads \"BRING ON THE NIGHT.\" Several skateboards are mounted on the wall near the sign. The camera slowly pushes in toward the person. During this movement, a small, dark, disc-shaped object flies from left to right across the top of the frame.",
