    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor setting resembling a modern, industrial-style loft with a skateboarding theme. The environment features a wooden ramp prominently placed in the center, surrounded by various skateboards mounted on the walls. The space is illuminated by natural light streaming through large windows, casting shadows and creating a warm ambiance. The interior includes eclectic elements such as neon signs and a mix of furniture, contributing to a creative and urban atmosphere. The time of day appears to be late afternoon, as indicated by the angle and quality of the light. The scene remains consistent throughout, maintaining a focus on the unique combination of skate culture and contemporary design.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is missing several key visual details and contains subjective language that should be removed. The point of view is a significant, unmentioned element; the scene is viewed from behind a large, out-of-focus green object in the foreground. The description of the light source as \"large windows\" is inaccurate; the light streams from gridded skylights or light panels in the ceiling. The caption should also mention other industrial features, such as the metal grate flooring in the foreground and the matching ceiling structure. The description of \"neon signs\" should be more specific, stating that a blue neon sign reads \"BRING ON THE NIGHT.\" The caption also omits the large, colorful abstract art piece on the left wall and a small, disc-shaped object that briefly flies across the top of the room. Finally, phrases like \"creating a warm ambiance,\" \"contributing to a creative and urban atmosphere,\" and the entire final sentence are interpretive and should be deleted to adhere to the instruction to avoid subjective analysis.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The scene is viewed from behind a large, out-of-focus green object in the foreground, looking into an indoor, industrial-style loft. A wooden skateboard ramp is positioned in the center of the room. Light streams down from gridded light panels in the ceiling, which has a matching metal grate structure. The flooring in the foreground is also made of a metal grate. On the back wall, several skateboards are mounted. To the left of these, a blue neon sign reads \"BRING ON THE NIGHT.\" On the far-left wall, there is a large, colorful abstract art piece. A person with short, light-colored hair stands on the ramp. Near the end of the clip, a small, disc-shaped object flies across the top of the room from left to right.",
