    "pre_caption": "The video presents a first-person POV shot of a person holding and examining a hand of playing cards. The setting is indoors, with a neutral, light-colored surface serving as the backdrop. The cards are standard playing cards, featuring a mix of red and black suits, with visible numbers and symbols. A deck of cards is placed on the table, partially visible, with a card face-up next to it. The lighting is even, suggesting a well-lit room, and the focus remains on the hands and cards, emphasizing the interaction with the deck.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is factually accurate. It correctly identifies the first-person point of view, the indoor setting, the light-colored surface, the presence of playing cards with red and black suits, and the deck on the table.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is incomplete. While it describes the initial state, it fails to mention the primary action in the video, which is the person actively drawing cards from the pile on the right and sorting them into the hand on the left. It describes a static scene (\"holding and examining\") rather than the dynamic action of playing or organizing a hand.\n\n**Adherence to the Instruction:**\nThe caption fails to adhere to several key instructions:\n*   **Violation:** It includes interpretive language by stating the scene is \"...emphasizing the interaction with the deck.\" The instructions explicitly state: \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\"\n*   **Violation:** It omits a description of the motion. The instructions require describing \"motion or changes,\" and the core of the video is the movement of the hands and cards.\n*   **Minor Violation:** The phrase \"suggesting a well-lit room\" is a minor inference, which the instructions advise against (\"Avoid speculative statements\"). A more direct description like \"The scene is evenly lit\" would be better.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a first-person perspective, a person holds a hand of playing cards at a white table. The front card is the six of spades. With their right hand, they pick up cards one by one from a pile on the right and add them to the hand on the left. They add a red card, then the eight of spades, and finally the ace of spades. As the cards are sorted, the hand reveals a 10 of diamonds, a Jack of diamonds, the six of spades, the eight of spades, and the ace of spades. A face-down deck and other scattered cards, including a face-up Jack of hearts, are on the table.",
