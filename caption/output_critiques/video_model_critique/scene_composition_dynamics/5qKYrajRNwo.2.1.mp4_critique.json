    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor setting with a warm, rustic atmosphere. The environment features a cluttered workspace with various tools and materials, suggesting a workshop or craft area. The lighting is soft and ambient, casting gentle shadows that enhance the cozy feel of the space. Notable visual elements include a wooden table with a textured surface, scattered with small objects and containers. The walls are adorned with hanging items, adding to the sense of a busy, lived-in space. The color palette consists of earthy tones, with browns and greens dominating the scene. The presence of figures engaged in activity adds a dynamic element, contributing to the overall impression of a bustling, creative environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is generally accurate in its description of the physical environment. It correctly identifies the indoor setting, the cluttered nature of the space, the warm lighting, the presence of a table with objects, and the earthy color palette.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is incomplete. It fails to mention the most distinctive visual characteristic of the scene: that it is a stop-motion animation featuring a puppet or clay-like figure. This is a fundamental aspect of the scene's style and scenery that should have been included. It also omits the point of view, which is a medium shot.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption violates several explicit negative constraints:\n\n*   **\"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":** The caption uses subjective words like \"warm, rustic atmosphere,\" \"cozy feel,\" \"busy, lived-in space,\" \"bustling, creative environment.\" These terms describe a feeling or impression rather than objective visual facts.\n*   **\"Do not infer the role of the scene setting\":** The caption infers the location's purpose by stating it is a \"workshop or craft area\" and a \"creative environment.\" The instructions require describing only what is visible (e.g., \"a cluttered room with tools and materials on shelves and a table\") without assigning a role to it.\n*   **\"Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions\":** While it avoids excessive detail about the figure, it misses the opportunity to describe the *style* of the scenery and subject (stop-motion animation), which is a critical visual element.\n\nIn summary, the caption is inaccurate in its adherence to the rules. It relies heavily on subjective interpretation and inference, which are explicitly forbidden, and it omits the most defining visual style of the video.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A medium shot in a stop-motion animation shows a puppet figure of a man with dark curly hair and a mustache. He is wearing a light-colored, vertically striped shirt and stands behind a wooden table in a cluttered indoor setting. The background is out of focus, showing shelves filled with various items. The lighting is soft and directional, creating a shallow depth of field. The color palette consists mainly of brown, tan, and other earth tones. On the table in front of the figure are a few small bottles.",
