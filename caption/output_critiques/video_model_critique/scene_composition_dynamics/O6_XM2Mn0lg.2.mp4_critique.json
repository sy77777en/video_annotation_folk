    "pre_caption": "The video takes place outdoors in a dense, shadowy forest at night, with the ground covered in a layer of snow or frost that reflects the limited ambient light. Tall, bare trees with dark, rough bark and tangled branches dominate the environment, creating a sense of enclosure. The lighting is dim and bluish, with a strong beam of light cutting through the darkness in one section, casting long shadows and illuminating patches of the snowy ground. The air appears cold and still, with no visible precipitation or wind movement. The overall color palette is muted, consisting mainly of dark blues, grays, and blacks, contributing to a stark, wintry atmosphere. No overlays, text, or digital elements are present within the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly identifies the setting as an outdoor forest with snow. The video actually takes place in a dark, cavernous environment with an uneven, rocky ground, not a snowy one. The tall, vertical elements are thin rock formations, possibly stalagmites, not \"bare trees with dark, rough bark and tangled branches.\" The description of the light as a \"strong beam\" is less accurate than describing it as a bright, blue horizontal lens flare emanating from the left. The caption also omits the low-angle, forward-moving point of view and the hazy or smoky quality of the air. Finally, it includes subjective interpretations like \"cold\" and \"stark, wintry atmosphere,\" which should be removed.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video is shot from a low-angle, forward-moving perspective inside a dark, cavernous environment. The ground is uneven and rocky, and thin, dark rock formations, resembling stalagmites, rise vertically from the floor. The lighting is dim, dominated by dark blues and blacks. A bright, blue horizontal lens flare shines from the left, cutting across the darkness and illuminating patches of the rocky ground. The air has a hazy or smoky quality. The scene contains no text or other digital overlays.",
