    "pre_caption": "The video, filmed by a drone, captures an aerial view of a rural landscape featuring a historic stone church with a tall spire. The setting is outdoors, surrounded by a mix of green trees and a golden-brown field, indicating a late summer or early autumn time of day. The church is positioned centrally, with a graveyard visible around it, marked by scattered headstones. The architecture of the church is characterized by its gray stone material and traditional design. The scene is bathed in natural daylight, highlighting the textures of the stone and the patterns in the harvested field. The drone's perspective provides a comprehensive view of the church and its surroundings, emphasizing the contrast between the structured architecture and the organic landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A video filmed by a drone.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good for this video. While it accurately identifies the main subject and setting, it violates several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description of the scene is generally accurate. It correctly identifies the drone's aerial view, the stone church with a spire, the rural landscape, the graveyard, the green trees, and the golden-brown field.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully includes the point of view (drone), setting (outdoors, rural landscape), time of day (natural daylight), and notable visual elements (church, graveyard, field).\n*   It could be slightly more complete by mentioning the light-colored path leading to the church.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption fails to adhere to several negative constraints outlined in the instructions:\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid speculative statements\":** The phrase \"indicating a late summer or early autumn time of day\" is an inference about the time of year based on the state of the field and grass. The instructions require describing only what is visible, not interpreting it.\n*   **Violation of \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights\":** The caption violates this rule twice.\n    1.  \"...highlighting the textures of the stone and the patterns in the harvested field.\"\n    2.  \"...emphasizing the contrast between the structured architecture and the organic landscape.\"\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":** The final sentence uses interpretive and analytical language (\"comprehensive view,\" \"structured architecture,\" \"organic landscape\") instead of sticking to a neutral, objective description. This sentence analyzes the composition rather than describing the visual facts.\n\nIn summary, the caption starts as a good description but devolves into interpretation and analysis in the latter half, directly contradicting the instructions to avoid speculation, subjectivity, and explaining emphasis.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "An aerial view, filmed by a drone, shows a gray stone church with a tall spire in a rural landscape. The church is surrounded by a graveyard with scattered headstones and is set amongst green trees. A light-colored path leads to the building. Next to the church grounds is a large, golden-brown field with patterns from vehicle tracks. The scene takes place outdoors in natural daylight.",
