    "pre_caption": "The video presents a third-person over-the-shoulder POV shot showing a character’s upper body in an indoor setting. The environment is a grand, ornate building with classical architectural elements, including decorative columns and intricate moldings. The walls are adorned with detailed carvings and a mix of soft, muted colors like beige and cream. The setting appears to be well-lit, suggesting daytime, with natural light filtering through unseen windows. The floor is scattered with debris, adding a slightly neglected feel to the otherwise elegant surroundings. The scene captures a sense of historical grandeur with its elaborate design and spacious layout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A third-person over-the-shoulder POV shot showing a character’s upper body.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains an interpretive statement and omits several specific visual details. The final sentence, \"The scene captures a sense of historical grandeur with its elaborate design and spacious layout,\" explains what the scene emphasizes, which is explicitly forbidden by the instructions. The phrase \"adding a slightly neglected feel\" is also subjective and should be replaced with a more objective description. Furthermore, the caption fails to mention the prominent stone balustrade in the mid-ground, the gold accents on the column capitals, or the sculpted face that is part of a column's decoration. The first sentence could also be more concise by starting with \"An over-the-shoulder shot\" instead of the longer \"The video presents a third-person over-the-shoulder POV shot.\"",
