    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor setting within a dimly lit restaurant, featuring a table set for a meal. The environment is characterized by a warm, subdued ambiance with dark wooden elements and traditional decor. The table is covered with a white tablecloth and adorned with plates of food, including a dish with noodles and vegetables, and a glass of iced tea. The lighting casts soft shadows, enhancing the intimate atmosphere. The scene includes individuals seated at the table, engaged in dining, with chopsticks in hand. The overall composition suggests a calm, focused dining experience, with the restaurant's decor and table setting providing a cohesive backdrop.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is partially accurate in describing the static elements of the scene. It correctly identifies the setting as a dimly lit restaurant, the white tablecloth, the plates of food, the glass of iced tea, and the presence of diners with chopsticks. However, the caption is highly inaccurate in its description of the overall mood and action. The phrase \"calm, focused dining experience\" directly contradicts the visual evidence. The video is characterized by extreme motion blur and rapid, shaky camera movement, creating a disorienting and chaotic feeling, not a calm one.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is incomplete as it omits several crucial visual details mentioned in the instructions:\n*   **Motion and Point of View:** The most significant feature of the video is the fast, blurry motion, suggesting a shaky, first-person, or handheld point of view. The caption completely fails to mention this, instead describing a static scene.\n*   **Overlays:** The caption does not mention the subtitle \"Susan\" that appears as an overlay at the beginning of the clip. The instructions explicitly require the description of such elements.\n*   **Scene Transition:** It fails to note the rapid pan or cut that shifts the focus from the older couple to the younger woman in the vest.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption does not fully adhere to the provided instructions in several key areas:\n*   **Describe Motion:** The instruction to \"describe motion or changes\" was not followed. The rapid camera movement is the defining characteristic of the clip and is entirely ignored.\n*   **Indicate Point of View:** The instruction to \"indicate the point of view\" was not followed. The shaky, blurry perspective is essential to understanding the scene and is a required detail.\n*   **Describe Overlays:** The instruction to describe overlays like subtitles was missed.\n*   **Avoid Subjective Adjectives:** The caption uses \"intimate atmosphere\" and \"calm, focused dining experience.\" While \"intimate\" is borderline, \"calm\" and \"focused\" are factually incorrect and subjective descriptions of the scene's feeling, which the instructions advise against.\n\nIn summary, while the caption correctly identifies the basic setting and props, it fails to capture the dynamic nature of the video. It misrepresents the scene's atmosphere and omits key visual information (motion, POV, overlays) that are required by the instructions, making it an inaccurate and incomplete description.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a shaky, blurry, first-person point of view inside a dimly lit restaurant, the camera briefly focuses on an older couple eating at a table. The woman wears a yellow top, and the man wears a red shirt. A white subtitle appears at the bottom, reading, \"Susan.\" The camera then executes a rapid, blurry whip pan to the right, shifting focus to a younger woman with glasses and a maroon vest sitting at the same table. The entire shot is characterized by extreme motion blur, obscuring fine details and creating a disorienting effect. The table is set with a white tablecloth, plates of food, and a glass of iced tea.",
