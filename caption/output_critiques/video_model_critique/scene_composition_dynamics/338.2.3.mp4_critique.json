    "pre_caption": "The video is set indoors in a dimly lit restaurant with a warm, inviting atmosphere. The setting features a round table covered with a white tablecloth, adorned with plates of colorful food and a glass of amber-colored drink. The restaurant's interior includes dark wooden elements and soft lighting, creating a cozy ambiance. The ceiling has a decorative design, adding to the traditional aesthetic. The scene captures a moment of dining, with subjects seated around the table, engaged in conversation. The overall environment suggests a relaxed and intimate dining experience.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good for this video because it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe description of the physical setting is generally accurate. It correctly identifies the location as a dimly lit indoor restaurant with a table, food, and dark wooden elements.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is incomplete. It completely omits the prominent subtitle overlay at the bottom of the screen (\"I didn't mean to put all that pr...\"), which is a critical element that the instructions explicitly require to be described. It also fails to mention the point of view (an eye-level shot from across the table) or the specific motion of the subject speaking.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption violates multiple core instructions:\n*   **Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives:** The caption uses several subjective and emotional words, such as \"inviting atmosphere,\" \"cozy ambiance,\" and \"relaxed and intimate dining experience.\" These are interpretations of the mood, not objective descriptions of the scene.\n*   **Avoid speculative statements:** The phrase \"The overall environment suggests...\" is speculative and explicitly forbidden by the instructions.\n*   **Do not infer the role of the scene setting:** The phrase \"adding to the traditional aesthetic\" is an inference about the style and purpose of the decor, which goes beyond simple description.\n*   **Describe overlay elements:** The caption fails to mention the subtitles, which is a direct violation of the instruction to describe overlays, their content, and placement.\n\nIn summary, while the caption captures the basic setting, it fails significantly by including forbidden subjective language and omitting required objective details like the on-screen subtitles.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "An eye-level, medium shot shows an East Asian woman with short, dark hair speaking while seated at a dining table in a dimly lit restaurant. She wears a maroon vest over a black shirt with a patterned collar and holds chopsticks over a plate of food. The round table is covered with a white tablecloth and holds several dishes, including a small white bowl and a tall glass of an amber-colored liquid in the foreground. The background is dark and out of focus, showing dark wood furniture and other tables. At the bottom of the screen, a white subtitle with a black outline reads, \"I didn't mean to put all that pr...\".",
