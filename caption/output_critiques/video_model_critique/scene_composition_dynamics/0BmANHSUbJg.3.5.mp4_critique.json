    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A drone POV shot.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is generally good, but it has a few issues regarding adherence to the instructions.\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n*   **Accuracy and Completeness:** The caption is highly accurate and complete. It correctly identifies the point of view, the setting as an outdoor airport at night, the central event of the plane crash, and key visual details like the damaged hangar, the aircraft's emblem, the wet tarmac, and the smoke.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Violation (Subjective Language):** The instruction states, \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The phrase \"adding to the dramatic atmosphere\" is a subjective interpretation of the scene's mood and should be omitted.\n    *   **Minor Violation (Inference):** The instruction says to \"Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain\" and to avoid speculative statements. While the tarmac is visibly wet, the phrase \"suggesting recent rain\" is an inference about the cause. A more direct and compliant description would be to simply state that \"the tarmac is wet.\"\n    *   **Minor Violation (Explaining Effect):** The instruction says, \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\" The phrases \"adding to the dramatic atmosphere\" and \"contributing to the industrial environment\" explain the *effect* of the visual elements rather than just describing them.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is not good because it violates key negative constraints, specifically by including subjective language (\"dramatic atmosphere\") and explaining the effect of certain elements on the scene's mood or feel.\n\nHere is a revised version that adheres more strictly to the instructions:\n\n**Revised Caption:**\n\nFrom a high-angle drone point of view, the video shows an outdoor airport tarmac at night. A large, light-colored aircraft has crashed into a hangar, causing the building's metal structure to collapse around the plane's wing and fuselage. The aircraft's tail features a dark, stylized bird emblem. Smoke billows from the wreckage, and the scene is lit by bright floodlights. The dark tarmac is wet and reflects the surrounding lights. In the background, other hangars and various airport ground vehicles are visible.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a high-angle perspective at night, a large airplane is shown crashed into an airport hangar. The metal structure of the hangar has collapsed onto the aircraft's left wing and fuselage. Smoke rises from the damaged building. The airplane is light-colored with a dark, stylized bird emblem on its tail. The surrounding tarmac is wet and reflects the bright artificial lights illuminating the scene. Other airport vehicles and buildings are visible in the background.",
