    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an outdoor setting on a rugged, mountainous terrain with a clear view of distant, layered hills under a bright sky, suggesting daytime. The ground is a mix of dirt and patches of green grass. Several horses, equipped with saddles, are scattered across the scene, grazing peacefully. The horses are brown with dark manes, and their saddles are made of leather, adding a rustic element to the natural environment. The overall atmosphere is serene, with the vast landscape providing a sense of openness and tranquility.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is mostly accurate in describing the core elements. The setting is a rugged, mountainous terrain, and there are saddled brown horses.\n*   However, describing the view as \"clear\" is inaccurate. The distant mountains are obscured by a noticeable haze, which is a key feature of the atmospheric conditions.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption provides a decent overview of the scene, mentioning the terrain, the horses, their saddles, and the background mountains.\n*   It omits the scattered rocks on the ground, which are a prominent feature of the rugged terrain.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption violates several negative constraints from the instructions:\n\n*   **\"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\"** The caption uses \"peacefully,\" \"serene,\" and \"tranquility.\" These words describe a mood or feeling, which is subjective. The instruction requires objective description only.\n*   **\"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\"** The caption states the landscape provides \"a sense of openness and tranquility.\" This is an interpretation of the scene's effect on the viewer, not a description of its physical content.\n*   **\"Do not infer the role of the scene setting.\"** The phrase \"adding a rustic element to the natural environment\" is an inferential statement about the style and role of the saddles, rather than a simple description of them.\n*   **\"Avoid speculative statements.\"** The phrase \"suggesting daytime\" is a mild form of speculation. A more direct, confident statement like \"The scene is set during the daytime under a bright, hazy sky\" would be better.\n\nIn summary, while the caption captures the general idea of the scene, it fails significantly by including subjective emotional language and interpretive analysis, which were explicitly forbidden by the instructions. A good caption would stick strictly to objective, factual descriptions of the visible elements.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The scene is set on a rugged, mountainous terrain during the daytime. The ground is a mix of dirt, patches of green grass, and scattered rocks. In the background, layered mountains are visible through a haze under a bright sky. Several brown horses with dark manes and leather saddles are on the hillside. A horse in the foreground is bent down grazing, while two others are in the background.",
