    "pre_caption": "The scene is set in an outdoor skate park during the day, featuring a fenced area with metal bars and benches. The ground is paved, and there are trees providing some shade. A skateboard is visible on the ground near a picnic table, suggesting activity related to skating. The environment is monochromatic, giving it a classic, timeless feel. The setting is calm, with no visible movement, and the focus is on the structural elements like the fence and benches, which are made of metal and wood. The overall atmosphere is quiet and still, with a clear view of the park's layout and features.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption omits several key elements required by the instruction. It fails to mention the presence and actions of a subject, specifically a person who interacts with the environment by lifting and tipping over a picnic table, which creates visible dust or debris. The caption incorrectly states that there is no visible movement and that the atmosphere is quiet and still, which contradicts the dynamic actions shown in the video. The description of the skateboard as merely \"suggesting activity\" is insufficient, as the subject’s interaction with the skateboard and the table is central to the scene. The caption does correctly note the outdoor skate park setting, the monochromatic style, and the presence of metal and wood structures, but it should also specify the camera’s fixed, side-on point of view and the absence of overlays. To improve, the caption should concisely describe the subject’s placement and actions, the movement of the table and resulting dust, and clarify that the scene is not static. Remove the inaccurate statements about stillness and lack of movement, and ensure all notable visual changes and subject interactions are included.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The scene unfolds in an outdoor skate park during the day, captured from a fixed, side-on point of view. A person is actively interacting with the environment, lifting and tipping over a picnic table, which stirs up visible dust or debris. This dynamic action contrasts with the otherwise monochromatic, classic feel of the setting. The ground is paved, and trees provide some shade, while metal bars and wooden benches define the fenced area. A skateboard lies on the ground near the table, central to the subject's interaction. The atmosphere is lively, with movement and activity, focusing on the subject's actions and the resulting changes in the environment. The video has no overlays, allowing a clear view of the park's layout and features.",
