    "pre_caption": "The video captures a vibrant outdoor garden scene filled with lush green foliage and clusters of bright orange and red flowers. The setting is likely during the day, as the lighting is natural and clear. The flowers have a textured appearance with small, rounded petals, and the leaves are broad with visible veins. A butterfly with striking black and white patterned wings is prominently featured, fluttering among the flowers. The scene is rich in color, with the contrasting hues of the butterfly and flowers creating a lively and dynamic visual. The environment is calm, with no visible weather effects, emphasizing the natural beauty of the garden.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "**Feedback on the Caption**\n\nThe caption provides a generally accurate and descriptive overview of the video's content. However, it fails to adhere to several key negative constraints in the instructions, particularly regarding subjectivity and interpretation.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description of the outdoor garden, green foliage, and orange/red flowers is accurate.\n*   The description of the butterfly as having \"black and white patterned wings\" is incomplete. The butterfly clearly has prominent light blue or cyan spots in addition to the white ones.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully describes the main elements (butterfly, flowers, leaves) and the motion (fluttering).\n*   It correctly identifies the time of day and the absence of specific weather conditions.\n*   It omits the point of view, which is a steady, close-up shot.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violation - Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives:** The caption uses several subjective words, such as \"vibrant,\" \"lush,\" \"striking,\" \"rich,\" \"lively,\" and \"natural beauty.\" The instructions require objective descriptions.\n*   **Violation - Avoid speculative statements:** The caption uses the phrase \"is likely during the day.\" The instructions state to avoid speculative language. The clear, natural light confirms it is daytime.\n*   **Violation - Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights:** The caption violates this rule twice. First, by stating the colors are \"creating a lively and dynamic visual,\" and second, by claiming the scene is \"emphasizing the natural beauty of the garden.\" These are interpretations of the visual effect, not direct descriptions of the content.\n\nIn summary, while the caption captures the essence of the scene, it needs to be revised to remove subjective language, interpretive statements, and speculation. It should also be corrected to include the blue coloration on the butterfly's wings for better accuracy.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is a steady, close-up daytime shot of a butterfly on a flowering plant in a garden. The butterfly has black wings with patterns of white and light blue spots. It rests on a cluster of small orange flowers, flapping its wings open and closed. The plant has green leaves with visible veins, and other clusters of red and orange flowers are visible in the surrounding foliage.",
