    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor setting with a warm, dimly lit atmosphere. The environment features a wooden surface cluttered with various items, including a dark, rectangular box with a latch. The walls have a textured appearance, possibly made of wood or a similar material, with a pattern of circular openings allowing light to filter through, creating a dappled effect. The lighting casts soft shadows, enhancing the cozy ambiance. The scene includes a figure interacting with the box, adding a sense of curiosity and engagement. The overall color palette is earthy, with deep browns, greens, and hints of vibrant colors from surrounding fabrics.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains subjective and speculative language that should be removed. The phrase \"possibly made of wood or a similar material\" is speculative and should be rephrased to be more factual, such as \"a textured wall.\" The description of the atmosphere as having a \"cozy ambiance\" is subjective and should be deleted. Similarly, the phrase \"adding a sense of curiosity and engagement\" infers emotion and explains the scene's emphasis, which is against the instructions. The description of the figure's interaction should be more direct, simply stating the action without interpreting its meaning. Finally, the caption omits the point of view, which is a side-on shot.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is a side-on shot of an indoor, dimly lit scene. On a wooden surface cluttered with various items, a figure with braided hair and a dark dress places their hands on a dark, rectangular box with a latch. In the background, a textured wall features a pattern of circular openings. The warm lighting casts soft shadows throughout the space. The overall color palette consists of earthy tones, including deep browns and greens, with some vibrant colors from nearby fabrics.",
