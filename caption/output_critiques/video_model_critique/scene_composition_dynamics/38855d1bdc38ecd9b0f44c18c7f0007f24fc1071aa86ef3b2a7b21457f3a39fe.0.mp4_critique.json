    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor setting within a mosque, characterized by its serene and spacious environment. The walls are adorned with light-colored stone tiles, and a large, intricately designed gold calligraphy panel is prominently displayed. Natural light filters through tall windows, illuminating the space with a soft glow. The floor is covered with a light carpet, and a wooden stand with detailed carvings holds an open book. The setting is calm and reflective, with a sense of quiet reverence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The provided caption is good but requires improvement to fully align with the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   **Accurate:** The description of the physical environment is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the indoor setting, light-colored stone tiles, the gold calligraphy panel, the natural light from windows, the carpeted floor, and the carved wooden stand.\n\n### Completeness\n*   **Incomplete:** The caption omits key elements present in the video.\n    *   **Subject:** It fails to mention the man, who is the central subject. The instructions state to include subjects and their context. A brief mention of the man in traditional attire would complete the scene's description.\n    *   **Motion:** The caption describes a static scene (\"holds an open book\"), but the video shows the man walking, kneeling, and placing the book on the stand. This sequence of actions is a primary part of the video's content.\n    *   **Point of View:** The video is filmed from a low angle, which is a notable visual characteristic that influences the viewer's perspective. This detail is missing.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n*   **Partial Adherence:** The caption follows some rules but violates others.\n    *   **Violation (Subjective Language):** The caption uses the words \"serene,\" \"calm,\" \"reflective,\" and \"quiet reverence.\" These are emotional and subjective adjectives that describe a mood, which the instructions explicitly forbid.\n    *   **Violation (Inference):** By describing a \"sense of quiet reverence,\" the caption infers the atmosphere and purpose of the scene, which goes against the instruction \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting.\" While identifying the location as a \"mosque\" is a reasonable deduction based on strong visual evidence, describing the *feeling* of the place is a clear violation.\n    *   **Adherence (Formatting):** The caption correctly provides a single, coherent paragraph without introductory text or markdown.\n    *   **Adherence (Focus):** It successfully focuses on the setting and scenery, but to the detriment of including the subject's context.\n\n### Summary\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   It accurately describes the physical attributes of the room, such as the materials, colors, and key objects.\n*   It follows the required paragraph structure.\n\n**What needs to be improved:**\n*   **Remove Subjective Language:** Eliminate words like \"serene,\" \"calm,\" \"reflective,\" and \"reverence.\"\n*   **Add the Subject and Motion:** Briefly describe the man and his actions (walking, kneeling, placing the book) to provide necessary context.\n*   **Mention the Point of View:** Include that the scene is shot from a low angle.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "Filmed from a low-angle perspective, the video shows a spacious room with light-colored stone tile walls and a carpeted floor. In the foreground is a carved wooden bookstand. A large, gold-colored panel with Arabic calligraphy hangs on the left wall, and light enters through high windows. A man with a beard, wearing a white cap and a white robe with gold trim, walks toward the stand while holding a blue book. He then kneels, places the book on the stand, and opens its pages.",
