    "pre_caption": "The scene is set indoors in a dimly lit, futuristic corridor with a green hue dominating the environment. The walls are lined with reflective, metallic panels that give the space a high-tech appearance. The corridor extends into the distance, creating a sense of depth and confinement. The lighting is low, casting subtle reflections and shadows across the surfaces, enhancing the sterile and mechanical atmosphere. A person is seated against the wall, wearing a dark uniform, adding to the industrial feel of the setting. The overall ambiance is one of tension and isolation, with the green lighting contributing to an otherworldly, technological vibe.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains subjective and interpretive language that violates the instructions. Phrases like \"high-tech appearance,\" \"enhancing the sterile and mechanical atmosphere,\" \"adding to the industrial feel of the setting,\" and the entire final sentence (\"The overall ambiance is one of tension and isolation, with the green lighting contributing to an otherworldly, technological vibe\") are interpretations of the scene's mood and effect, which should be avoided. The description of the walls as \"metallic panels\" is also inaccurate; they more closely resemble large, illuminated circuit boards. The caption should be revised to provide a more objective and precise description of the visual elements.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This close-up shot shows a man with dark hair inside a long, narrow corridor, which is illuminated by a pervasive green light. The walls and ceiling are lined with panels resembling large, glowing green circuit boards, with patterns that repeat down the length of the hallway. The man is seated on the floor, leaning against the right wall. He wears a dark blue jumpsuit over a white t-shirt and looks directly at the camera with a wide-eyed, intense expression. A patch with the letters \"ASA\" and \"WEIR\" is visible on his jumpsuit. To his right is a piece of electronic equipment with visible internal components.",
