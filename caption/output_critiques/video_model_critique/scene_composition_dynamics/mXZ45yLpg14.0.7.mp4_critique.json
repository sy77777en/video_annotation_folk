    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an outdoor setting in a dense, foggy forest with tall, leafless trees reaching into a gray, overcast sky. The atmosphere is eerie and still, with a muted color palette dominated by grays and browns. The ground is covered in damp foliage, and the air appears heavy with mist. A person in a protective suit and gas mask stands among the trees, suggesting a hazardous environment. The suit is orange with black straps and equipment, including a gauge and a yellow device, adding a sense of caution and preparedness. The overall scene conveys a sense of isolation and quiet in a potentially dangerous natural setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

The phrases \"eerie,\" \"suggesting a hazardous environment,\" \"adding a sense of caution and preparedness,\" and the entire final sentence (\"The overall scene conveys a sense of isolation and quiet in a potentially dangerous natural setting\") should be removed. The description of the trees as \"pine trees with sparse needles\" is speculative and inaccurate; they should be described as \"bare\" or \"leafless.\" The caption also omits the initial low-angle point of view and the camera's tilting motion. To correct this, the description should begin by mentioning the low-angle shot looking up at the bare trees against the foggy sky, followed by the camera tilting down to reveal the person standing on the dark, wet-looking ground. The description of the person's suit and equipment is accurate but should be presented without the interpretive context.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a low-angle shot looking up at tall, leafless trees against a gray, foggy sky. The camera tilts down through the dense, misty forest to reveal a person standing on the dark, wet-looking ground. The person is wearing an orange protective suit with black straps, a gas mask, and an air tank on their back. A yellow device and a gauge are attached to the suit. The scene has a muted color palette dominated by grays and browns.",
