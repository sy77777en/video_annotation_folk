    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an outdoor setting in a dense, dry field of tall, golden-brown reeds. The time of day appears to be during daylight, with sunlight casting a warm glow over the scene. The ground is covered with dry, broken stalks, adding a textured layer to the earth. The reeds are slender and vertical, creating a natural barrier that fills the environment. A person is present, wearing green boots and beige clothing, standing amidst the reeds, which suggests a sense of exploration or movement through the field. The overall atmosphere is calm and natural, with the earthy tones of the reeds dominating the visual palette.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption is good, but it could be improved by adhering more closely to the instructions. Here is a detailed breakdown of your caption's performance:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description of the environment (dense, dry field, golden-brown reeds, daylight, textured ground) is accurate.\n*   The description of the person's clothing (green boots, beige clothing) is a reasonable and accurate observation.\n*   A key inaccuracy is stating the person is \"standing.\" The video clearly shows the person walking through the reeds.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully describes the setting, time of day, and key visual elements like the reeds and ground cover.\n*   It omits the specific **point of view**. The camera is positioned at a very low angle, looking up at the person's legs, which is a significant stylistic choice.\n*   It fails to describe the primary **motion** in the scene, which is the person walking.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violation:** The caption includes speculative and interpretive language. The phrase \"which suggests a sense of exploration or movement\" is an inference, which the instructions explicitly forbid (\"Avoid speculative statements\").\n*   **Violation:** The caption uses subjective adjectives to describe the atmosphere (\"calm and natural\"), which is also against the instructions (\"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\").\n*   **Violation:** The caption does not describe the motion of the person walking, as instructed (\"describe... human-made movements such as... pedestrians walking\").\n*   **Violation:** The caption does not mention the point of view, which the instructions require (\"indicate the point of view... and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception\").\n\n### Corrected Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised version of the caption that aligns better with the provided instructions:\n\nFrom a low-angle perspective, the video shows an outdoor scene set in a dense field of tall, golden-brown reeds during the day. Sunlight creates a warm glow on the environment. The ground is covered with a thick layer of dry, broken stalks. The lower half of a person wearing dark, knee-high boots and beige pants is seen walking away from the camera, moving through the dense vegetation.",
