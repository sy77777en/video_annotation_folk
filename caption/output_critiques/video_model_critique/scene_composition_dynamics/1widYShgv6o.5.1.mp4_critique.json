    "pre_caption": "The video captures an outdoor athletic stadium during a track event, likely a championship, as indicated by the signage. The setting is a large, modern arena with tiered seating filled with spectators. The track is a standard red running surface with marked lanes. The time of day is likely daytime, as the stadium is well-lit, though artificial lighting may also be present. The weather is clear, with no visible signs of rain or adverse conditions. The scene includes athletes in motion, running along the track, with officials and equipment visible near the sidelines. The environment is vibrant, with colorful banners and digital screens displaying event information, contributing to the dynamic atmosphere of the competition.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption generally follows the instruction by describing the outdoor stadium, the track event, the modern arena, the presence of spectators, and the clear weather. However, it includes speculative language such as \"likely a championship\" and \"likely daytime,\" which should be avoided. The caption should explicitly mention the point of view, which is a ground-level, trackside perspective that follows the runners. The overlays, such as digital screens and banners, are present but should be more specifically described as overlays, including their placement and content (e.g., digital leaderboards above the stands, event branding along the track). The description of the athletes and officials is appropriate, but the phrase \"the environment is vibrant\" is subjective and should be omitted. The caption could be improved by specifying the color and material of the track (red synthetic surface), the shape and arrangement of the seating, and the presence of large digital displays showing event information. Remove any speculative or subjective language and ensure all notable visual elements are described with clear, objective detail.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures an outdoor athletic stadium during a track event, with clear signage indicating it is a championship. The setting is a large, modern arena with tiered seating filled with spectators, arranged in a semi-circular shape around the track. The track is a red synthetic surface with marked lanes. The time of day is daytime, as the stadium is well-lit, with artificial lighting also present. The weather is clear, with no signs of rain or adverse conditions. The point of view is ground-level, trackside, following the runners in motion. Digital screens above the stands display leaderboards, while colorful event branding lines the track. Athletes are seen running along the track, with officials and equipment visible near the sidelines. Large digital displays show event information, contributing to the dynamic atmosphere of the competition.",
