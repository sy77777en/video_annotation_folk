    "pre_caption": "The video takes place indoors in a modern, softly lit living space with neutral-colored walls and large windows that allow natural daylight to filter in. In the background, a dining area is visible, featuring a rectangular table with several dark-colored chairs arranged around it. The room contains minimal decor, with a framed mirror or artwork on one wall and a few pieces of furniture that have clean, simple lines. The overall atmosphere is calm and uncluttered, with smooth surfaces and a muted color palette dominated by shades of gray, white, and black. The lighting is diffuse, creating gentle shadows and a subdued ambiance throughout the space.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "**Feedback on the Caption:**\n\nThe caption provides an accurate description of the background environment but is incomplete and fails to capture the most critical elements of the scene.\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description of the indoor space—the modern living area, dining set, minimal decor, and muted color palette—is accurate. The characterization of the lighting as diffuse and subdued is also correct.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is significantly incomplete.\n    *   **Point of View:** It completely omits the most crucial aspect of the video: the first-person/selfie point of view. The scene is clearly shot by the person in the frame, who is looking directly into the lens.\n    *   **Subject Context:** While the instructions advise focusing on the setting, they also state to include the subject's placement and context. The caption fails to mention the person in the foreground at all, making the description feel disconnected from what is actually being shown.\n    *   **Motion:** The caption describes a static scene, failing to mention the subtle hand-held camera movement and the blurry motion of an object passing on the right side of the screen.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption successfully follows the rules to avoid speculation, use objective language, and focus on the setting's details. However, it fails to adhere to the instructions to specify the point of view and to describe motion. By leaving out the POV and the subject's context, it does not provide a full description of the \"overall scene.\"\n\nIn summary, the caption accurately details the background but misses the fundamental context of *how* the scene is being viewed and *who* is in it, making it an incomplete representation of the video.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video is shot from a close-up, first-person/selfie perspective, focusing on a young woman with curly, light-brown hair looking directly into the camera. The camera is held with a slight unsteadiness, suggesting it is hand-held. Behind her, the out-of-focus background reveals a modern, softly lit living space with a muted color palette. A dining area with a table and chairs is visible in the distance. At the beginning of the clip, a blurry object, possibly a hand, moves quickly across the right side of the frame.",
