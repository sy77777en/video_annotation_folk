    "pre_caption": "An upward view captures the ornate interior ceiling of a building, dominated by a large dome. This dome consists of numerous greenish-blue stained glass panels arranged in a grid pattern within a dark framework, converging towards a central circular design. The surrounding ceiling area is cream-colored and features elaborate, detailed carvings. Small, warm lights are embedded around the base of the dome, above an inscribed band. A multi-tiered, ornate chandelier hangs from the dome's center. Below, architectural features like arches are partially visible. The scene is illuminated by artificial lighting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is missing the specific location of the scene, which is identifiable as the Preston Bradley Hall within the Chicago Cultural Center. The instruction states to explicitly name the location if it is known. Additionally, the description could be made more concise by combining related details. For instance, the description of the ceiling and its carvings can be integrated more smoothly. The final sentence about the artificial lighting is redundant, as the presence of the chandelier and embedded lights already implies this.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "An upward view captures the magnificent ceiling of Preston Bradley Hall in the Chicago Cultural Center, focusing on its large, iconic dome. The dome is composed of numerous greenish-blue stained glass panels set in a dark, grid-like framework that converges at a central design. It is nestled within a cream-colored ceiling adorned with elaborate carvings and an inscribed band at its base, which is illuminated by a ring of small, warm lights. Hanging from the center of the dome is an ornate, multi-tiered chandelier, while the tops of arches are partially visible below.",
