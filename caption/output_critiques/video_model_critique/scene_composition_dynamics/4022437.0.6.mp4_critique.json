    "pre_caption": "The scene takes place outdoors during the day in a parking area with a clear sky. A sleek black car with its doors open is prominently featured. The car's interior is visible, showcasing tan leather seats and a polished dashboard with air vents. The exterior of the car is shiny, with large silver alloy wheels. The ground is paved, and a building with a flat roof is visible in the background. The setting is calm, with no visible movement or people, emphasizing the car's design and features.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains several inaccuracies and omissions based on the video. The point of view is from inside the car, gradually pulling back to reveal more of the rear seat area and then the exterior, rather than a general exterior view. The video focuses on the tan leather interior, rear seats, and open doors, with the camera moving from the back seat area outward, but does not provide a clear, full view of the car's exterior or dashboard. The mention of a \"sleek black car\" and \"polished dashboard with air vents\" is partially accurate, but the dashboard is not a prominent feature in the video; the rear seat area and door panels are more visible. The caption also incorrectly states \"no visible movement or people,\" but a person is briefly visible in the reflection on the car's exterior. The environment is an outdoor paved area next to a light-colored industrial building under daylight, which should be described more precisely. There are no overlays or notable weather effects. To improve the caption, focus on the camera's point of view from inside the car looking outward, emphasize the tan leather interior, open doors, visible silver alloy wheel, and the paved lot with a light industrial building in the background, and avoid mentioning features not clearly shown, such as the full dashboard or an overall exterior view. Remove the statement about \"emphasizing the car's design and features,\" as it is interpretive.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a view from inside the car, focusing on the tan leather interior and rear seat area. The camera gradually pulls back, highlighting the open doors and door panels. As the perspective shifts outward, a silver alloy wheel becomes visible. The setting is an outdoor paved area next to a light-colored industrial building under a clear sky. A brief reflection of a person is seen on the car's exterior, adding a subtle dynamic element to the scene. The video does not provide a full view of the car's exterior or dashboard, concentrating instead on the interior and immediate surroundings.",
