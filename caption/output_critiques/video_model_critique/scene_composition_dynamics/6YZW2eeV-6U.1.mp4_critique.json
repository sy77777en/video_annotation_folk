    "pre_caption": "The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, descending into a stone tunnel. The setting is outdoors, featuring a narrow passageway with textured stone walls and ceiling, suggesting an ancient or historical structure. The stone surfaces are rough and uneven, with a sandy beige color. The time of day appears to be bright, likely midday, as natural light illuminates the scene. The environment is dry, with no visible vegetation or water. The passageway leads downward, creating a sense of movement as the viewer progresses deeper into the tunnel. The overall atmosphere is one of exploration, with the stone architecture being the most prominent visual element.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description of the physical environment—the stone tunnel, its texture (\"rough and uneven\"), and color (\"sandy beige\")—is accurate.\n*   The identification of the time of day as bright with natural light is also correct.\n*   The statement that the setting is \"outdoors\" is partially inaccurate. The scene begins at an outdoor entrance but primarily takes place within a covered stone passageway.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is incomplete as it entirely omits the presence of the three men walking into the tunnel. The instructions state to include subjects to complement the scene, and their presence is a key part of the video's context and action.\n*   It also fails to mention the concrete stairs that the people are descending, which is a distinct feature of the floor.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption fails to adhere to several key negative constraints:\n*   **Avoid Speculation/Inference:** The caption violates this rule multiple times with phrases like \"suggesting an ancient or historical structure,\" \"appears to be bright,\" and \"likely midday.\" The instructions explicitly forbid speculative language.\n*   **Avoid Subjective/Interpretive Language:** The caption uses subjective phrases like \"creating a sense of movement\" and \"The overall atmosphere is one of exploration.\" The instructions state to avoid emotional/subjective adjectives and not to explain what the scene emphasizes.\n*   **Focus on Setting but Include Subjects:** While the caption focuses on the setting, it completely fails to follow the instruction: \"If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail.\" The men are central to the action and should have been mentioned briefly.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is not good. While it accurately describes some physical aspects of the scene, it violates several core instructions. It includes forbidden speculation and subjective interpretation, and it omits essential elements like the people and the stairs. To be compliant, the caption would need to remove the interpretive language and add a concise, objective description of the men and the stairs they are walking on.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a first-person perspective, the camera follows three men walking down a set of concrete stairs into a narrow stone passageway. The man in the lead wears an orange t-shirt and a blue backpack. To the right, a second man is dressed in a blue and white jacket. The man directly in front of the camera wears a striped shirt, a white hat, and a red backpack. The walls and ceiling of the passageway are made of large, rough, sandy-beige stone blocks. Bright, natural sunlight illuminates the entrance.",
