    "pre_caption": "The video, captured from a broadcast POV shot set up for television production, takes place indoors at a city hall setting. The environment is bustling with activity, featuring a crowd of people and numerous microphones positioned prominently in the foreground, indicating a press conference. The lighting is bright, typical of indoor artificial lighting used in such events. The scene is framed tightly around a central figure speaking, surrounded by journalists and cameras. Overlays include text at the bottom of the screen, providing context with phrases like \"Rob Ford Speaks at City Hall\" and \"Happening Now,\" along with a news ticker summarizing the event. The overall atmosphere is dynamic, with the focus on the interaction between the speaker and the media.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A broadcast POV shot where the camera is set up for television production.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains several interpretations and misses some specific visual details. The phrases \"indicating a press conference,\" \"emphasizing the immediacy of the broadcast,\" and \"The focus is on the interaction between the speaker and the media\" are all interpretations of the scene's purpose or effect, which should be removed. The description of the lower-third graphic as a \"news ticker\" is inaccurate, as a ticker typically scrolls. The caption also omits several specific visual elements, such as the CBC logo overlay in the bottom right corner, the \"Nikon\" brand visible on a camera to the left, and the \"Global\" news logo on one of the microphones. The description of the overlays should be more precise, detailing all the text and logos present.",

The scene is lit with bright, artificial light. Several on-screen graphics are present. In the top right corner, a red box contains the word \"LIVE\" in white. At the bottom of the screen, a white banner on the left reads \"ROB FORD SPEAKS AT CITY HALL\" with the sub-heading \"Calls allegations of cocaine use of an 'outright lie'\".
