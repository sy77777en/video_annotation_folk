    "pre_caption": "The video captures an indoor setting within a traditional Asian restaurant. The environment features ornate wooden paneling with intricate carvings and warm lighting that creates a cozy atmosphere. The ceiling is adorned with decorative elements, enhancing the cultural ambiance. Tables are set with dishes and drinks, indicating a dining scene. Patrons are seated around tables, engaged in conversation and enjoying their meals. The presence of servers moving between tables adds a dynamic element to the scene. The overall color palette is warm, with rich browns and golds dominating the decor, complemented by the colorful attire of the diners.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is good, but it can be improved for better accuracy and completeness according to the instructions.\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the setting as a traditional Asian restaurant and accurately describes the decor (ornate wooden paneling, warm lighting), the general activity (patrons dining and conversing), and the overall color palette.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is mostly complete but misses a few details required by the instructions.\n    *   It fails to mention the video player's timeline/scrubber overlay visible at the bottom of the screen. The instructions explicitly state to describe overlays.\n    *   While it mentions \"decorative elements,\" it could be more specific by noting the prominent golden, ornate archway in the background, which is a key feature of the decor.\n    *   It does not mention the point of view, which is an eye-level shot from a seated or standing position near the main table.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres well to most of the instructions.\n    *   **Strengths:** It successfully focuses on the setting and scenery over subjects, avoids speculative language, uses a single paragraph, and describes the scene holistically without referring to specific frames.\n    *   **Areas for Improvement:** It uses the slightly subjective adjective \"cozy,\" which the instructions advise against. While it describes the effect of the lighting, a more neutral term could be used. The primary deviation is the omission of the overlay, which is a specific requirement.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption provides a good and accurate description of the scene's atmosphere and setting. However, to be fully compliant with the instructions, it should be revised to include the missing details about the overlay and the point of view, and it could be made more specific regarding the background decor while removing the subjective term \"cozy.\"",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "An eye-level shot from a seated or standing position captures the interior of a busy, traditional Asian restaurant. The environment is characterized by warm lighting, ornate wooden paneling with intricate carvings, and a prominent golden, decorative archway in the background. Several tables are occupied by patrons who are eating, drinking, and conversing, while servers move between them. The overall color palette is warm, dominated by rich browns from the woodwork and gold from the decorative elements, complemented by the colorful attire of the diners. A video player timeline is visible as a thin, dark overlay at the very bottom of the screen.",
