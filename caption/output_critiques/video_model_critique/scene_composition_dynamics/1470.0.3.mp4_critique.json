    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an outdoor scene in front of a small, single-story house with a yellow exterior and a gray shingled roof. The house features a white door, partially open, and windows with decorative crossbars. A brick chimney is visible on the roof. The setting is a sunny day, with a clear blue sky and well-maintained green grass in the front yard. Red flowers and green shrubs line the pathway leading to the entrance. The scene is captured from an objective point of view, providing a clear and detached perspective of the house and its surroundings.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is well-written, accurate, and adheres to most of the instructions. Here is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description of the house (single-story, yellow exterior, gray shingled roof, white door, decorative window crossbars, brick chimney) is entirely accurate.\n*   The description of the environment (outdoor, sunny day, clear blue sky, green grass, red flowers, green shrubs) is also correct.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully covers the main aspects of the scene, such as the architecture, time of day, and general landscaping.\n*   However, it omits a few notable visual elements that would enhance the description:\n    *   **Subject:** The most significant omission is the person standing in the foreground with their back to the camera. The instructions state, \"If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail.\" A brief mention of the person facing the house is essential for a complete scene description.\n    *   **House Number:** The number \"6701\" is clearly visible next to the door and is a specific, objective detail.\n    *   **Garden Gnome:** A distinct garden gnome is visible on the left, which adds a specific character to the yard.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths:** The caption correctly follows the instructions to be a single paragraph, avoid terms like \"image,\" focus on the setting, use simple language, and identify the point of view.\n*   **Areas for Improvement:** As mentioned under \"Completeness,\" the primary deviation from the instructions is the complete omission of the human subject. The phrase \"providing a clear and detached perspective\" is slightly interpretive, but acceptable.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is very good but could be improved by being more complete. Including the person, the house number, and the garden gnome would create a more comprehensive and accurate picture of the scene without violating the rules of conciseness or objectivity.\n\nHere is a revised version that incorporates this feedback for comparison:\n\n**Revised Caption Example:**\nAn outdoor, eye-level shot shows a person with their back to the camera, facing a single-story house on a sunny day. The house has yellow siding, a gray shingled roof with a brick chimney, and windows with diamond-patterned crossbars. The house number \"6701\" is visible next to the partially open white front door. A brick path leads to the entrance, flanked by green shrubs, red flowers, and a garden gnome on the left. A large bush stands on the right, and the sky is clear blue.",
