    "pre_caption": "The video captures an outdoor scene during sunset, featuring a serene landscape with a prominent tree in the foreground. The setting is a grassy field with a few scattered trees in the distance. The sky is painted with warm hues as the sun sets on the horizon, casting a gentle glow over the scene. The environment is calm, with no visible movement, emphasizing the natural beauty of the landscape. The overall atmosphere is peaceful, with the sun's rays filtering through the tree branches, creating a picturesque view.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is mostly accurate in describing the general setting (outdoor field, trees, sunset). However, it is inaccurate when it states there is \"no visible movement.\" The video clearly shows a slow upward camera pan, and there are small, illuminated particles (likely dust or insects) drifting through the air.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is incomplete. It omits several notable visual details required by the instructions, such as:\n*   **Point of View:** It fails to mention the ground-level point of view.\n*   **Motion:** It misses the slow upward pan of the camera.\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** It does not describe the sun being positioned behind the tree trunk, which creates a prominent lens flare that moves as the camera shifts. It also fails to mention the small, bright particles floating in the air.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption violates several explicit negative constraints:\n*   **Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives:** The caption uses \"serene,\" \"gentle,\" \"calm,\" \"peaceful,\" and \"picturesque,\" all of which are subjective and emotional terms.\n*   **Do not explain what the scene emphasizes:** The caption includes the phrase \"emphasizing the natural beauty of the landscape,\" which is an interpretation and violates this rule.\n*   **Describe motion:** The instruction requires describing motion, but the caption incorrectly states there is none.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video, shot from a low-angle perspective, shows a field at sunset. A large, silhouetted tree with leafy branches is in the foreground on the left. The sun is positioned behind the tree's trunk, casting a bright, yellow-orange glow across the horizon. In the distance, a field with low vegetation and a few other silhouetted trees are visible against the hazy sky. The camera slowly pans upward. As it moves, the sun's light emerges from the side of the trunk, creating a lens flare, and small, illuminated particles float through the air.",
