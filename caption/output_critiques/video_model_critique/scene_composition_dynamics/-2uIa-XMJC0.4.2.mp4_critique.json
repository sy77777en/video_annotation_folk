    "pre_caption": "The video, captured from a drone POV, showcases a futuristic urban landscape during daylight. The setting is outdoors, featuring a cityscape with modern skyscrapers and reflective glass facades. The architecture is sleek and contemporary, with tall buildings dominating the skyline. The scene includes a person positioned on a ledge of a high-rise building, adding a sense of scale and height to the environment. The sky is clear with a few clouds, enhancing the bright and expansive view of the city below. The drone's perspective provides a sweeping view of the urban environment, emphasizing the verticality and modernity of the setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A drone POV shot.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption is a good attempt, but it has some significant inaccuracies and fails to follow key instructions.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is fundamentally inaccurate in its description of the perspective. It states the video \"showcases a futuristic urban landscape\" and provides a \"sweeping view of the urban environment.\" However, the video does not show the cityscape directly. Instead, it shows a close-up of a building facade made of large, reflective windows, and the cityscape is only visible as a reflection in these windows. This is a critical distinction that the caption misses entirely.\n*   The description of the sky as \"clear with a few clouds\" is misleading. The sky, seen in the reflection, is heavily clouded, creating a somewhat overcast but bright atmosphere, not a clear one.\n*   The claim that the \"drone's perspective provides a sweeping view\" is incorrect. The camera is largely static, focused on one section of the building, and does not sweep across the environment.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption fails to describe the most prominent architectural feature of the scene: the building is composed of a grid of large, metallic-framed window panels. It only vaguely mentions \"reflective glass facades.\"\n*   It omits the unusual visual effect where a semi-transparent double of the person is visible, standing slightly offset from them.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violation:** The caption includes interpretive and analytical statements, which the instructions explicitly forbid. Phrases like \"adding a sense of scale and height to the environment\" and \"emphasizing the verticality and modernity of the setting\" explain what the scene highlights, which is against the rules (\"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights\").\n*   **Violation:** The caption speculates on the point of view (\"drone POV\") and then builds an inaccurate description around it (\"The drone's perspective provides a sweeping view\"). While identifying the POV is allowed, the description of its action (sweeping) is incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is **not good**. It misinterprets the central visual element of the scene (the reflection) and violates the core instruction to avoid interpretive analysis. A good caption would describe the building's grid-like, reflective surface and accurately state that the cityscape is seen within these reflections, while avoiding any explanation of the scene's \"emphasis\" or \"sense of scale.\"",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A static, medium close-up shot focuses on the facade of a building made of a grid of large, metallic-framed, rectangular windows. A person with short, light-colored hair, wearing a white beanie, a white tank top, and white pants, stands on a skateboard on the ledge of one of the window sections. The person has a prosthetic on their left leg. The windows are highly reflective, showing a futuristic cityscape with skyscrapers under a bright but heavily clouded sky. A faint, semi-transparent double of the person is visible standing slightly offset from them. The scene takes place during the day.",
