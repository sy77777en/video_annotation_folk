    "pre_caption": "The video, captured from a drone POV, presents an aerial view of a winding racetrack set in a dry, open landscape. The setting is outdoors, likely during the day, as indicated by the clear visibility and shadows. The environment features a paved track surrounded by sparse vegetation and dusty terrain, typical of a desert or arid region. Notable visual elements include a black car drifting around the curves of the track, producing thick white smoke from its tires, which contrasts with the muted earth tones of the surroundings. The car's movement creates dynamic patterns on the track, emphasizing the motion and energy of the scene. The overall atmosphere is one of speed and precision, with the drone's perspective providing a comprehensive view of the car's path and the expansive landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A drone POV showing an aerial view.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is accurate. It correctly identifies the point of view as a drone shot, the subject as a black car drifting, the setting as a racetrack in a dry, open landscape, and the key visual elements like the winding track and the thick white smoke.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is comprehensive, covering the environment, time of day, main action, and notable details like the car's color and the terrain. It successfully combines details from the entire clip into a single, coherent description.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption fails to adhere to several key negative constraints in the instructions.\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\" and \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights\":** The caption includes interpretive and subjective phrases. For example, stating that the car's movement creates \"dynamic patterns\" and is \"emphasizing the motion and energy of the scene\" is an analysis of the scene's effect, not an objective description.\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":** The sentence, \"The overall atmosphere is one of speed and precision,\" is a subjective interpretation of the mood and is explicitly forbidden.\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid speculative statements\":** The use of \"likely during the day\" is a minor form of speculation, which the instructions ask to avoid. It is better to state what is visible (e.g., \"The scene is set during the day under a bright sky\").\n\nIn summary, while the caption accurately describes the visible content, it violates the core instructions by including subjective analysis, interpreting the scene's atmosphere, and explaining what the visuals emphasize, rather than sticking to a purely objective and descriptive account.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This aerial video, captured from a drone's perspective, shows a black car drifting on a winding, paved racetrack. The car moves around a curve, producing a thick plume of white smoke from its rear tires. The track is situated in a dry, open landscape with brown, dusty terrain and sparse vegetation. The scene takes place outdoors during the daytime under a bright, hazy sky. In the background, there are low hills, and tire marks are visible on the surface of the track.",
