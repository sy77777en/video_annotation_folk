    "pre_caption": "The scene is set in a dimly lit interior, where dark wooden paneling covers the walls. The paneling features rectangular sections, and a more ornate, carved wooden element is partially visible. This carving, possibly a coat of arms or a decorative piece above a mantel, includes a lion and a shield, rendered in dark wood. The lighting is very low, casting deep shadows across the room and obscuring much of the detail, with only a faint, cool-toned light illuminating parts of the wooden surfaces.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly identifies the foreground element as a \"metal chain-link fence or gate\"; it is an unidentifiable dark silhouette that partially obscures the view. The description of the light source is speculative, as no \"barred window\" is visible, and the resulting shadow is not \"grid-like\" but rather resembles the shadow of tree branches. The phrase \"adding to the mysterious ambiance\" is subjective and should be removed. The caption also omits the key motion in the scene: a moving light source that gradually reveals more of the ornate carving, which is identifiable as the Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom, complete with the motto \"DIEU ET MON DROIT\" visible at the bottom.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The scene is set in a very dark room with wood-paneled walls, viewed through a large, dark silhouette in the foreground that obscures much of the frame. A cool-toned light source, moving from left to right, gradually illuminates a section of the wall, casting shadows that resemble tree branches. As the light moves, it reveals an ornate, carved wooden structure, which is identifiable as the Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom. The carving includes a lion, a shield, and, as the light reaches the bottom, the motto \"DIEU ET MON DROIT\" becomes visible.",
