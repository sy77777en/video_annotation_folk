    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor setting with dim, moody lighting, creating a shadowy atmosphere. The environment appears to be a confined space, possibly a room with dark walls. The time of day is indeterminate due to the low light, but the scene suggests an evening or nighttime setting. Notable visual elements include a person holding an object, possibly food, with a focused expression. The person is wearing a dark leather jacket, adding to the subdued color palette. The lighting casts soft shadows, highlighting the texture of the jacket and the person's features. The overall scene conveys a sense of quiet introspection within a confined, dimly lit space.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good for this video. It fails on multiple points of the instructions, particularly regarding accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the rules against speculation and subjective language.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption incorrectly identifies the setting as \"possibly a room with dark walls.\" The scene clearly takes place inside a vehicle, as indicated by the visible window and the general interior shape.\n*   It inaccurately states the time of day is \"indeterminate.\" The deep darkness outside the window strongly indicates a nighttime setting.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption omits a crucial and prominent visual element: the sharp, triangular piece of what appears to be shattered glass hanging down from the top of the scene.\n*   It fails to describe the point of view, which is a close-up shot of the subject from a low angle.\n*   It does not mention the motion within the scene, where the man's expression changes as he looks up suddenly.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid speculative statements\":** The caption uses prohibited speculative phrases like \"appears to be,\" \"possibly a room,\" and \"suggests an evening or nighttime setting.\"\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":** It uses subjective words like \"moody\" and describes the scene as conveying \"a sense of quiet introspection,\" which is an emotional interpretation.\n*   **Violation of \"Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions\":** The caption mentions the person's \"focused expression,\" which is a detail about the subject's state rather than the environment.\n*   **Violation of \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights\":** The phrase \"highlighting the texture of the jacket\" explains the effect of the lighting, which is against the instructions. The final sentence, \"The overall scene conveys a sense of quiet introspection,\" is a direct interpretation of the scene's meaning.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A low-angle, close-up shot shows the interior of a vehicle at night. The scene is dimly lit from an off-screen source, casting the background in deep shadow. A man with a short beard is seen in profile, wearing a dark jacket. He holds a paper-wrapped object in his hands. At the top of the frame, a sharp, triangular piece of broken glass hangs down. The man is initially looking down at the object before his head and eyes snap upward.",
