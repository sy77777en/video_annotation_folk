    "pre_caption": "The video is a third-person 3D game scene where the entire character is visible on screen. It transitions between an outdoor and indoor setting. Outdoors, the scene features a small garden with a patch of tilled soil, surrounded by a white picket fence and a wooden house with a stone path leading to the entrance. The grass is lush and green, indicating a daytime setting with clear weather. Indoors, the environment is a cozy wooden room with a warm, rustic feel. Notable elements include a lit fireplace casting a soft glow, a red circular rug, a small round table with a candle holder, and a framed picture on the wall. The character interacts with various objects, such as tending to plants outside and engaging with furniture inside. Overlay elements include a HUD at the bottom of the screen displaying icons and numbers, which are not part of the scene itself.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A third-person 3D game video where the entire character is visible on screen.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains several inaccuracies and omits key details. The statement that the scene is set during \"daytime\" is incorrect; the lit lamppost and warm, dim lighting indicate it is dusk or night. The claim that the \"character interacts with various objects, such as tending to plants outside and engaging with furniture inside\" is also false, as the character only walks from the garden into the house without any interaction. The description of the indoor scene is incomplete, failing to mention the prominent bed and wardrobe. Furthermore, the caption uses subjective terms like \"cozy\" and \"rustic feel,\" which should be avoided. To improve the caption, correct the time of day to dusk or night, and remove the inaccurate description of character interactions. Add the missing furniture (bed, wardrobe) to the indoor description and replace subjective adjectives with objective descriptions. For example, instead of \"cozy wooden room with a warm, rustic feel,\" use \"a wooden room.\"",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is a third-person 3D game scene that transitions from an outdoor to an indoor setting. The scene begins outdoors in a grassy yard in front of a wooden house. The lighting, which includes a lit lamppost, suggests it is dusk or night. A character, depicted as a figure with a pumpkin-like head wearing a blue cloak, stands near a small garden plot enclosed by a white picket fence. The character then walks along a stone path and enters the house. The view shifts to the interior, revealing a wooden room containing a lit fireplace, a red circular rug, a bed, a wardrobe, a small table with a candle holder, and a framed picture on the wall. A game HUD is visible as an overlay at the bottom of the screen.",
