    "pre_caption": "The video depicts a simple indoor setting with a plain, light-colored background. The focus is on a traditional Russian nesting doll, characterized by its vibrant blue and orange colors, intricate floral patterns, and a painted musical instrument. The doll stands upright initially, showcasing its detailed design. As the video progresses, the doll is seen lying on its side, maintaining the same decorative features. The environment is minimalistic, with no additional elements or props, emphasizing the doll's craftsmanship and design. The lighting is even, highlighting the doll's colors and patterns without casting strong shadows.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption is a good start, but it has some significant issues regarding accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description of the doll and the background is accurate.\n*   However, the caption is inaccurate by omission. It states that \"the doll is seen lying on its side\" as if it happened on its own. It completely fails to mention the central action of the video: a hand entering the frame and flicking the doll, which is what causes it to fall.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is incomplete because it omits the most crucial element of motion in the video—the hand and its action. The instruction specifically asks to describe \"human-made movements.\"\n*   It also omits the point of view, which is a static, eye-level shot.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violation (Describing Motion):** The primary failure is not describing the \"human-made movements.\" The video's entire narrative is the interaction between the hand and the doll, which is completely missing from your description.\n*   **Violation (Avoiding Interpretation):** The caption violates the instruction, \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\" You included interpretive phrases like \"emphasizing the doll's craftsmanship and design\" and \"highlighting the doll's colors and patterns.\" These are subjective conclusions about the video's purpose, not objective descriptions of its content.\n\nIn summary, the caption accurately describes the static elements but fails to describe the key action that occurs. It also includes forbidden interpretive language, making it non-compliant with the instructions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a static, eye-level perspective, a single Russian nesting doll stands upright against a plain, light-colored background. The doll is painted with blue and white floral patterns and depicts a figure holding a brown, triangular musical instrument. A hand enters the frame from the right and flicks the top of the doll with a finger. The doll is knocked over, falling onto its side and rolling slightly before coming to a rest. The hand then moves out of the frame.",
