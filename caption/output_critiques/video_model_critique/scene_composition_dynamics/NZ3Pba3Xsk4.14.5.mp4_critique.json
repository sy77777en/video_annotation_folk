    "pre_caption": "The video takes place outdoors in a landscaped garden area bordered by a textured, light brown wall with a large window reflecting trees and wooden structures. The setting features a well-maintained grassy lawn with scattered rocks, small trees, and shrubs, as well as a black metal staircase with wooden steps leading upward. A beige fence with horizontal slats encloses the area, and a yellow sign with white and black graphics is mounted on the fence. The environment is bright, indicating daytime, and the sky is clear, allowing sunlight to illuminate the greenery and cast soft shadows across the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption omits several key elements visible in the video. It does not mention the presence of people standing near the building, which are notable subjects in the scene and should be briefly referenced to fulfill the instruction. The caption also inaccurately describes the environment as a \"landscaped garden area\" with a \"well-maintained grassy lawn,\" \"scattered rocks,\" and \"shrubs,\" but the video shows a more urban, zoo-like outdoor setting with a concrete walkway, glass railing, and visible residential buildings in the background, which should be included for accuracy. The caption should clarify that the point of view is from a moving camera at eye level, likely handheld, as it pans from a close-up of a textured wall and window to a wider view of the outdoor enclosure and surrounding area. The description of the signs is generally accurate, but the placement and context could be clearer, specifying that some signs are attached to a concrete pillar and others to the fence. The mention of a \"black metal staircase with wooden steps\" is correct, but the caption should also note the glass railing and the overall modern architectural style. The time of day and lighting are described well. To improve, the caption should: (1) briefly mention the people present and their placement, (2) accurately describe the setting as an outdoor zoo or animal enclosure area with urban surroundings, (3) clarify the camera movement and point of view, (4) specify the placement of signs and overlays, and (5) remove references to a \"well-maintained grassy lawn\" if it is not the main ground surface.",
