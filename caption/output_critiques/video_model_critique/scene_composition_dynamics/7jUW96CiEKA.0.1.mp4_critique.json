    "pre_caption": "The video captures a serene outdoor setting by a calm body of water, likely a river or pond, surrounded by natural elements. The time of day is not explicitly clear, but the lighting suggests a tranquil atmosphere. The water's surface is smooth, reflecting the surrounding environment, with occasional ripples indicating movement. In the background, fallen logs and sparse vegetation are visible, adding texture and depth to the scene. The environment is peaceful, with subtle activity on the water's surface, possibly from wildlife. The overall color palette is natural, with earthy tones from the logs and greenery, complemented by the muted hues of the water.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good for this video. It fails to accurately and completely describe the scene and violates several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy and Completeness:**\n*   **Major Omission:** The caption completely fails to mention the primary subject and action of the video: a small, dark bird flying low over the water and splashing into it. It vaguely refers to \"subtle activity on the water's surface, possibly from wildlife,\" which is an inaccurate and weak description of the central event.\n*   **Overlay Omission:** The caption does not mention the white text overlay \"water\" that appears at the beginning of the clip. This is a notable visual element that should have been included.\n*   **Inaccurate Time of Day:** The caption states, \"The time of day is not explicitly clear,\" which is incorrect. The lighting clearly indicates it is daytime.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid speculative statements\":** The caption uses forbidden speculative language such as \"likely a river or pond\" and \"possibly from wildlife.\"\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":** The caption uses subjective words like \"serene,\" \"tranquil,\" and \"peaceful,\" which the instructions prohibit.\n*   **Misinterpretation of \"Focus on the setting\":** While the instructions ask to focus on the setting rather than providing *detailed* subject descriptions, this was misinterpreted as ignoring the subject and its actions entirely. The bird's movement is the most significant event in the scene and should have been described concisely as part of the overall scene description.\n*   **Failure to Describe Motion:** The caption only mentions \"occasional ripples,\" failing to describe the prominent motion of the bird flying and splashing, which is the main action in the video.\n\nIn summary, the caption is inaccurate because it misrepresents the scene's activity and incomplete because it omits the main subject, its action, and the text overlay. It also fails to follow fundamental rules of the prompt by including speculative and subjective language.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is a daytime, outdoor shot of a body of water. In the background, a riverbank with a large, fallen tree trunk is out of focus. The water in the foreground is a murky, greenish-brown color with ripples on its surface. At the beginning of the clip, the word \"water\" appears in white text. A small, dark bird flies low over the water from right to left. It dips down, splashing into the water and creating a spray, before continuing its flight just above the surface.",
