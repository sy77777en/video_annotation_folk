    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor setting within a car, viewed from an objective perspective. The scene takes place during the day, as indicated by the natural light filtering through the windows. The car's interior features a dashboard and steering wheel, with three individuals seated inside. The upholstery appears to be dark, complementing the overall muted color scheme. Outside the car, blurred elements suggest a tree-lined street. Overlay text is present, displaying a quote: \"We were just doing it to show off.\" - Spike Lee, prominently placed across the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly describes the setting as \"indoor.\" The camera is positioned outside the car, looking in, making it an outdoor scene focused on the car's interior. The caption also fails to mention the change in the overlay text, which initially reads \"snow off.\" before transitioning to the full quote. The phrase \"complementing the overall muted color scheme\" is subjective and should be removed. The description of the upholstery is speculative as it is not clearly visible. A more accurate caption would describe the scene as an outdoor, daytime shot from the perspective of someone looking through the front windshield of a car. It should note the visible rearview mirror and windshield wiper, as well as the three individuals inside. Finally, it should accurately describe the overlay text, noting that the white text initially reads \"snow off. - Spike Lee\" before changing to \"We were just doing it to show off.\" - Spike Lee\" in the center of the view.",

The man on the left appears to be asleep, the man in the middle is speaking and gesturing, and the man on the right is driving. A rearview mirror is visible at the top of the frame, and a windshield wiper rests at the bottom. Through the car's windows, a blurry, tree-lined street can be seen. Overlay text in white appears. Initially, it reads \"snow off.\" - Spike Lee\". It then changes to the full quote, \"We were just doing it to show off.\" - Spike Lee\", positioned in the center of the screen.",
