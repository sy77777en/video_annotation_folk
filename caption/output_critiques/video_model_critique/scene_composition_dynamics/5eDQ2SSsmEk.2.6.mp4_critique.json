    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor setting within a vehicle during nighttime. The environment is dimly lit, with the interior illuminated by soft, ambient light reflecting off the wet, rain-speckled windows, suggesting rainy weather outside. The scene features a person seated in the driver's seat, holding a takeout container with chopsticks, indicating a casual, intimate moment. The vehicle's dashboard and steering wheel are visible, with a coiled cord hanging nearby, adding to the confined, personal atmosphere. The overall color palette is muted, with dark tones and subtle highlights from the exterior lights filtering through the rain-streaked glass, creating a moody, contemplative ambiance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Your feedback is excellent. The caption is well-written and captures many key aspects of the scene, but it misses a crucial visual element and includes subjective interpretations that violate the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description of the scene as an indoor setting within a vehicle at night is accurate.\n*   The identification of rainy weather based on the rain-speckled windows is correct.\n*   The description of the person eating from a takeout container with chopsticks, as well as the presence of the dashboard, steering wheel, and coiled cord, is accurate.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is incomplete because it completely omits the most distinct visual element: the overlay of glowing red particles and snowflake-like shapes that appear over the food and in the background. The instructions specifically require the description of overlays, including their color, shape, and placement. This is a significant omission as it's a defining feature of the shot.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violations:** The caption violates the instruction to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\" and \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\"\n    *   Phrases like \"indicating a casual, intimate moment,\" \"confined, personal atmosphere,\" and \"moody, contemplative ambiance\" are subjective interpretations of the scene's mood and atmosphere, which should be avoided.\n*   **Strengths:** The caption successfully follows several instructions:\n    *   It correctly identifies the setting, time of day, and weather.\n    *   It describes key props and elements within the vehicle.\n    *   It uses a single, coherent paragraph and avoids referring to specific frames.\n    *   The language is generally clear and concise.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption provides a good foundation by accurately describing the physical setting and the subject's actions. However, its failure to mention the prominent visual overlay makes it incomplete, and its use of subjective, interpretive language to describe the atmosphere directly contradicts the negative constraints provided in the instructions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video shows a person in profile sitting inside a dimly lit vehicle at night. They are holding a takeout food container and eating from it with chopsticks. Outside, rain is visible on the windows. The vehicle's steering wheel and a coiled cord are partially in view. A visual overlay is present, consisting of glowing red particles that appear over the food and small, white, snowflake-like shapes that drift in the background. The overall color palette is dark, with exterior lights reflecting on the rain-streaked glass.",
