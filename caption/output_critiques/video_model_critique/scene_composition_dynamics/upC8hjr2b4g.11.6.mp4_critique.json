    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor setting with a monochromatic color scheme, primarily in shades of gray. The environment resembles a dimly lit room with a tiled floor, where several figures are positioned. In the foreground, seated figures face a group of standing figures in the background. The standing figures are arranged in a semi-circle, with one figure prominently illuminated at the center, suggesting a focal point. The seated figures are in shadow, creating a contrast with the lit background. The room's atmosphere is subdued, with minimalistic design elements. Overlays include text or visuals placed at the bottom left corner, not part of the scene itself.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains factual inaccuracies and omits key visual details. The statement \"An overlay in the bottom left corner of the video reads '[26]'\" is incorrect; there is no such overlay in the video. The phrase \"Contrary to the initial description\" is extraneous and should be removed. The description of the figures' arrangement is confusing; it should be clarified that a single central figure, with its back to the viewer, faces a line of standing figures. The caption also fails to describe the most notable visual element: the figures themselves are not realistic people but are stylized, low-polygon, statue-like models, all rendered in a uniform pale gray. Additionally, the word \"subdued\" is a subjective adjective and should be avoided.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is an indoor scene rendered in a monochromatic, blue-gray color palette. The setting is a dimly lit room with a tiled floor, populated by stylized, low-polygon, statue-like figures, all a uniform pale gray. In the foreground, the backs of several seated figures are visible in shadow. They are arranged like an audience, facing a central, standing figure who also has their back to the viewer. This central figure is illuminated by a spotlight and is being confronted by a semi-circle of other standing figures. The stark lighting creates a strong focal point on the central group, contrasting them with the darkened audience and surroundings.",
