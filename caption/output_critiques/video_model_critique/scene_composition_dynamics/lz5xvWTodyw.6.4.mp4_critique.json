    "pre_caption": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, pans across a dimly lit room with dark green walls and a herringbone-patterned wood floor. The space is illuminated by a single wall sconce, revealing several framed portraits of men on the walls. Furnishings include a dark wood side table with a candlestick-style telephone, a single cream-colored chair, and a large, ornate blue-and-white vase in a corner. A wooden door with a brass handle is visible to the left. Two men in period clothing are present in the room, with the character in the foreground holding a pistol.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly describes the video as a single continuous pan. The video contains a hard cut transition that is not mentioned. The first shot shows the first-person character in a dark coat holding a pistol. After a hard cut, the second shot shows the same character now wearing a vest and bowtie, with the pistol no longer visible, before the camera pans to the left. The description should be restructured to describe these two distinct shots and the transition between them. Additionally, the phrase \"as if through the character’s eyes\" is redundant and can be removed, as \"first-person POV shot\" already conveys this meaning.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with a first-person POV shot of a character in a dark coat holding a pistol in a dimly lit room. In the background, a Black man in a formal suit stands with his hand to his chest. A hard cut transitions to a new shot where the first-person character is now wearing a vest and bowtie, and the pistol is no longer visible. The camera then pans to the left, moving past the other man and across the room. The space has dark green walls, a herringbone-patterned wood floor, and is illuminated by a single wall sconce. The pan reveals several framed portraits of men on the walls, a dark wood side table with a candlestick-style telephone, a single cream-colored chair, a large, ornate blue-and-white vase in a corner, and a wooden door with a brass handle to the far left.",
