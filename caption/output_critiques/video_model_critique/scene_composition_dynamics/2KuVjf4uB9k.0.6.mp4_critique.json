    "pre_caption": "The video, filmed by a drone, captures an outdoor setting on a dry, expansive asphalt track surrounded by arid, rocky terrain. The time of day is bright, likely midday, with clear skies casting strong sunlight over the scene. A car is prominently featured, drifting across the track, creating thick plumes of white smoke that trail behind it. The car is sleek, with a dark body and vibrant decals, including a notable logo on the side. The surrounding landscape is barren, with sandy hills in the background, emphasizing the desolate environment. The drone's perspective provides a dynamic view of the car's movement, highlighting the speed and precision of the drift against the stark, open backdrop.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A video filmed by a drone.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\nThe caption is good but has several areas for improvement regarding accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the negative constraints in the instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **Point of View:** The caption states the video is \"filmed by a drone.\" This is inaccurate. The video is a montage of shots from multiple perspectives, including high-angle drone shots, low-angle chase shots, and what appear to be fast, tilted on-board camera shots. The description should reflect this variety of perspectives.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** The caption correctly mentions the car's dark body and vibrant decals. However, it misses a very prominent and distinguishing feature: the car's hood is missing, leaving the engine completely exposed. This is a key detail that should be included.\n*   **Scene Transitions:** The video cuts between different camera angles and shots. The caption describes the scene as if it were a single, continuous shot, failing to mention the rapid transitions between the various perspectives (drone, low-angle, etc.).\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violation of Negative Constraints:** The caption violates the instruction, \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\"\n    *   The phrase \"...**emphasizing** the desolate environment\" is an interpretation of the scene's mood or focus.\n    *   The final sentence, \"The drone's perspective provides a dynamic view of the car's movement, **highlighting** the speed and precision of the drift against the stark, open backdrop,\" is almost entirely interpretive analysis rather than a neutral description.\n*   **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction is to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The caption uses words like \"sleek,\" \"vibrant,\" and \"dynamic,\" which are subjective assessments of the car and the view.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe caption successfully captures the general setting and action. However, it is inaccurate about the camera work, incomplete in its description of the main subject, and violates key instructions by including interpretive language and subjective analysis instead of sticking to a purely objective description.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video presents a montage of shots featuring a car drifting on an asphalt track. The setting is an outdoor, arid landscape with barren, sandy hills under a bright, clear sky. The car has a dark body with light blue and orange decals and a prominent \"NOS ENERGY DRINK\" logo on its side. Its hood is missing, exposing the engine. As the car drifts, it generates large plumes of white smoke from its tires. The footage cuts between multiple camera angles, including high-angle overhead views, low-angle shots that follow the car, and fast, tilted perspectives from close to the ground.",
