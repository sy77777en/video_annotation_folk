    "pre_caption": "The video presents a whimsical, monochromatic scene with a surreal, artistic style. The setting is outdoors, featuring a backdrop of stylized lotus flowers floating on water. The environment is calm and imaginative, with a focus on playful, cartoon-like creatures. In the first part, a seal-like creature is depicted with a textured, sketch-like appearance, lying on the ground. In the latter part, three elephant-like figures stand in a row, each with exaggerated features and a similar sketchy texture. The overall composition is characterized by its black-and-white color scheme and the creative, dreamlike quality of the characters and setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback for the caption is as follows:\n\nThe caption uses subjective and emotional adjectives such as \"whimsical,\" \"surreal,\" \"imaginative,\" \"playful,\" \"creative,\" and \"dreamlike,\" which should be removed. The phrase \"with a focus on...\" explains the scene's emphasis, which is against the instructions. The description is broken into \"the first part\" and \"the latter part,\" violating the rule to describe the video as a whole or to describe the transition between scenes. The caption fails to mention the motion of the penguins moving across the screen or the transition that occurs when the scene changes from the seal and penguins to the elephants. Additionally, the description of the scene as \"monochromatic\" and having a \"black-and-white color scheme\" is redundant.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is a black-and-white, hand-drawn sketch animation set against a background of repeating, stylized lotus flowers. The video opens with a cartoon seal lying in the foreground. A line of cartoon penguins on small platforms then slides across the screen from right to left, passing behind the seal. The seal looks up and raises its flippers as the penguins move past and exit the frame. The scene then cuts to three cartoon elephants standing in a row, dancing with their trunks in the air.",
