    "pre_caption": "The scene is set in a sunlit, paved urban plaza during the day. Large, light-colored tiles cover the ground, reflecting the bright sunlight and casting long shadows. In the background, several multi-story buildings are visible, with one prominent structure featuring a tall tower. Green trees line the edge of the plaza. A green, wheeled trash bin with black graffiti depicting a face with heart-shaped eyes is being pushed across the plaza.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good for this video.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is accurate in what it chooses to describe. The setting is indeed a sunlit, paved urban plaza with the specified architectural features, trees, and a green trash bin with graffiti.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is severely incomplete and therefore misleading. It completely omits the most prominent and dynamic subject of the video: the person in a large bird costume who is actively skateboarding. This is the central action of the clip, and its absence makes the description a poor representation of the content. The caption focuses only on the static background and the man pushing the bin, which is a secondary element.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Overall Scene Description:** The caption fails to provide an \"overall\" description because it misses the main action and a key subject.\n*   **Point of View:** It fails to mention the distinct low-angle, wide-angle perspective, which is a crucial stylistic element that shapes the viewer's perception of the scene.\n*   **Subjects:** The instruction states to \"ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail.\" The caption omits the most significant subject entirely.\n*   **Motion:** While it mentions the bin is \"being pushed,\" it completely ignores the far more dynamic motion of the skateboarder jumping.\n\nIn summary, while the caption accurately describes the background environment and adheres to the negative constraints (e.g., no emotional language, no speculation), it fails on the primary task of providing a complete and informative description of the overall scene by omitting the central action and subject. It describes the stage but leaves out the main actor and their performance.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a low, wide-angle perspective in a sun-drenched urban plaza, a man in a yellow safety vest pushes a green wheeled trash bin with graffiti on it. As he leans back, a person wearing a full-body grey bird costume and red shoes skateboards into the frame, captured mid-air while performing a jump. The scene is set on large, light-colored paving stones, with city buildings and trees visible in the background under a bright sky.",
