    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a ground-level view of a circular, rusted metal manhole cover set into the asphalt surface of a city street intersection during the daytime. The cover features a textured grid pattern and several small holes. White crosswalk lines are visible on the street, and multi-story buildings with large windows form the background corner. The perspective then shifts to an overhead view looking down from inside the manhole shaft, revealing a bomb attached to the underside of the cover. The device consists of multiple red dynamite sticks held by metal bands, connected by red, blue, and green wires to a central timer unit with a green digital display showing numbers.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on the caption. It is well-structured, detailed, and adheres to most of the instructions. Here is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is almost entirely accurate. It correctly identifies the manhole cover, its features, the surrounding environment, and the components of the bomb. However, there is one significant inaccuracy in the description of the point of view for the second part of the video. The caption states, \"The perspective then shifts to an overhead view looking down from inside the manhole shaft,\" which is contradictory. The view is from *inside* the shaft, looking *up* at the underside of the manhole cover.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is very complete. It successfully captures the key visual elements of both scenes, including the setting, the primary objects, and their specific details like texture, color, and material. It also correctly notes the transition between the two perspectives.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Point of View:** The caption correctly identifies the initial \"ground-level view\" but mischaracterizes the second point of view.\n    *   **Setting & Details:** The description of the city street, buildings, asphalt, crosswalk lines, and the bomb's components is excellent and follows the instructions perfectly.\n    *   **Structure & Language:** The caption is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English. It avoids speculation, emotional language, and terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   **Transitions:** It correctly identifies and describes the shift in perspective from the street level to the view from within the manhole.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is very strong but contains a key error in describing the second point of view. By correcting \"an overhead view looking down from inside the manhole shaft\" to \"a view from inside the manhole shaft, looking up,\" the caption would be fully accurate and an excellent example of following the provided instructions.",
