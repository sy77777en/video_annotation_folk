    "pre_caption": "The video, captured from a dashcam POV mounted on a vehicle, shows an urban street scene at night. The setting is outdoors, featuring a well-lit intersection with a Gulf gas station prominently visible. Streetlights and traffic signals illuminate the area, casting light on the road and surrounding structures. Vehicles are seen moving along the street, and the gas station is active with cars parked nearby. The environment is calm, with clear weather conditions, allowing for a clear view of the road and the gas station's signage. The scene is characterized by the contrast between the artificial lights and the dark night sky.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A dashcam POV shot where the dash cam is mounted on a vehicle, capturing the road ahead.**\"",

The word \"calm\" is a subjective adjective and should be avoided per the instructions. The description of the camera movement could be more precise; the pan to the right reveals another dark-colored vehicle pulling up near the gas station, not just \"more parked vehicles.\" Additionally, the caption omits notable foreground elements like the white and yellow bollards and the red traffic lights at the intersection.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This dashcam video captures an urban street intersection at night. A brightly lit Gulf gas station is prominently featured on the corner. In the foreground, a sign displays gas prices, and several white bollards with yellow tops are visible. The intersection is illuminated by streetlights and red traffic signals. A silver minivan is parked near the gas station's entrance, while a white bus is stopped further down the street on the left. As the video progresses, the camera pans slightly to the right, revealing a dark-colored vehicle pulling up on the far right side of the frame. The scene is characterized by the artificial lighting contrasting with the dark night sky.",
