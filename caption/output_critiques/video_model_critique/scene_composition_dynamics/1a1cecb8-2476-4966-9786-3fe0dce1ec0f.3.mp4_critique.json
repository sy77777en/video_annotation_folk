    "pre_caption": "The video presents a first-person POV shot in an outdoor urban setting during the early evening. The scene features a paved walkway bordered by a decorative black metal railing with a stone base. On the left, a multi-story brick building with large windows is visible, surrounded by trees with green and purple foliage, indicating a park-like area. The sky is overcast, casting a soft, diffused light over the scene. Street lamps with a warm glow line the path, adding to the ambiance. The environment is calm, with no visible movement, suggesting a peaceful moment in the city.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good for this video. While it correctly identifies several key elements, it fails to adhere to multiple core instructions, including accuracy regarding motion and the avoidance of subjective language.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is inaccurate in its description of motion. It states, \"The environment is calm, with no visible movement,\" but the video clearly shows a slow, steady forward movement consistent with a person walking. The first-person point of view has a slight bobbing motion, which is a key aspect of the scene that has been missed and contradicted.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is reasonably complete. It successfully identifies the point of view, outdoor urban setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like the building, trees, railing, and street lamps. However, it fails to mention the motion, which is a significant part of the video's content.\n\n**Adherence to the Given Instruction:**\nThe caption violates several key negative constraints from the instructions:\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":** The phrase \"adding to the ambiance\" is subjective and describes the feeling or mood of the scene, which is not a direct visual observation.\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid speculative statements\":** The clause \"suggesting a peaceful moment in the city\" is an inference about the atmosphere, which is explicitly forbidden.\n*   **Violation of \"Describe motion or changes\":** The instruction requires describing movement like \"pedestrians walking.\" The caption fails to describe the clear walking motion and instead incorrectly states there is none.\n*   **Minor Violation of \"Do not infer\":** The phrase \"indicating a park-like area\" is a minor inference. A more direct description, such as \"across from a park,\" would be better if certain, or simply describing the trees and grass would be sufficient.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is a first-person point-of-view video showing a steady forward walking motion along a paved urban walkway at dusk. On the far left of the frame, a person with pink hair, sunglasses, and a black face mask is partially visible. The walkway is bordered on the left by a decorative black metal railing on a light-colored stone base. Beyond the railing, a multi-story building stands behind trees, some with green leaves and others with purple blossoms. The sky is overcast, and ornate street lamps along the path are lit.",
