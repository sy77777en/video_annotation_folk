    "pre_caption": "The video takes place outdoors at night in a city square, featuring a large, ornate fountain with multiple tiers and sculpted figures at its base. The fountain is illuminated by golden and white lights, highlighting its detailed carvings and smooth, reflective surfaces. Surrounding the fountain, the ground is paved and wet, reflecting the lights from nearby sources. In the background, a tall obelisk and a brightly lit Ferris wheel with a circular shape and multicolored lights are visible, adding to the urban atmosphere. The sky is dark with scattered clouds, and artificial lights create starburst effects around the square. Overlay elements include a watermark with the text \"MATHIEU STANIC\" in white, located in the lower right corner, which is not part of the scene itself.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "There is a factual error in the caption, as the Eiffel Tower is not visible at any point in the video. The caption also misdescribes the scene transition; the video does not start with the Eiffel Tower in view but instead transitions from a tighter shot to a wider one that reveals a tall obelisk. The caption omits the specific, identifiable location, which should be stated as Place de la Concorde in Paris. Additionally, it fails to mention the prominent motion of the rotating Ferris wheel. Finally, the description of the watermark is slightly inaccurate, as the text below the name changes during the video; simplifying the description to just the name \"MATHIEU STANIC\" would be more accurate.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with a nighttime shot in the Place de la Concorde in Paris, focusing on the ornate, multi-tiered Fontaine des Mers and a large, rotating Ferris wheel to its left. The fountain is illuminated by golden lights, highlighting its detailed sculptures, while the Ferris wheel glows with red, white, and blue lights. The view then widens to reveal the tall Luxor Obelisk standing to the right of the fountain. The ground is wet, reflecting the various light sources that create starburst effects against the dark, cloudy sky. A watermark for \"MATHIEU STANIC\" is visible in the lower right corner.",
