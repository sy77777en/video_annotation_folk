    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is arcing clockwise.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent attempt at a detailed and concise caption. Here is a breakdown of its accuracy and completeness based on the instructions provided.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n*   **Accuracy:**\n    *   **\"high-angle view\"**: Correct. The camera is positioned above the subjects and angled downwards.\n    *   **\"from eye level\"**: This is partially correct for the starting position, but it's slightly misleading. The camera is angled down significantly, and more importantly, it moves vertically.\n    *   **\"employing deep focus to keep all elements sharp\"**: This is inaccurate. While the depth of field is not extremely shallow, it is not deep focus. The background elements, such as the boats and distant structures, are noticeably softer and less sharp than the women in the midground. \"Deep focus\" implies that nearly everything in the frame is in sharp focus.\n    *   **\"smoothly arcs clockwise\"**: Perfectly accurate. This correctly identifies the primary horizontal movement and its direction.\n    *   **\"maintaining a steady and fluid motion\"**: Correct. The movement is very stable, likely achieved with a gimbal or drone.\n\n*   **Completeness:**\n    *   The caption successfully identifies the main arcing movement. However, it completely misses the simultaneous **upward craning motion**. The camera doesn't just circle the subjects; it also rises significantly, changing the perspective from a high angle to an even higher one by the end of the clip. This is a key part of the shot's dynamic feel.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption follows the instructions to be concise and to describe the angle, height, focus, and movement. However, it falters on the accuracy of the focus description and misses a crucial element of the camera's movement.\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised caption that is more accurate and complete:\n\n**From a high angle, the camera executes a slow and steady clockwise arc while simultaneously craning upward around two women on beach loungers. The shot maintains focus on the subjects with a moderately deep depth of field, keeping the beach background relatively clear.**",
