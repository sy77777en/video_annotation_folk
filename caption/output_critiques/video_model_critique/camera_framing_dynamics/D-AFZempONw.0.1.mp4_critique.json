    "pre_caption": "Shot from a low angle, the camera focuses on a cybernetic figure in the foreground, utilizing a shallow depth of field. The camera performs a smooth, minor backward movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is moving backward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Your analysis of the caption is excellent. Here is a detailed breakdown of its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the provided instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **\"Shot from a low angle...\"**: Correct. The camera is positioned below the subject, looking up, which emphasizes its size and power.\n*   **\"...the camera focuses on a cybernetic figure in the foreground...\"**: Correct. The subject is a figure with mechanical and biological elements, and it occupies the foreground.\n*   **\"...utilizing a shallow depth of field.\"**: Correct. The background is visibly blurred, drawing all attention to the figure.\n*   **\"The camera performs a smooth, minor backward movement.\"**: This is partially accurate but incomplete. The camera does move backward (dolly out), but it also simultaneously tilts down to reveal the character's face. Describing it as just a \"minor backward movement\" misses the vertical component and the primary purpose of the shot, which is the reveal.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully identifies the key static elements of the shot (angle, focus).\n*   However, it fails to fully describe the camera's compound movement. The instruction asks to describe movements like tilting and their purpose. In this case, the camera dollies back *and* tilts down specifically to reveal the character's face and the transformation of the tubes from red to green. This is a crucial narrative element of the shot that the caption omits.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   The caption adheres well to the instruction for conciseness and correctly omits unnecessary information like standard video speed and lack of lens distortion.\n*   It falls short on the instruction to \"describe them in temporal order\" and mention the \"purpose\" of the camera movement. The movement is not just a simple backward dolly; it's a combined dolly-out and tilt-down executed to create a dramatic reveal.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is a good, concise summary but lacks the detail required by the instructions regarding the complexity and purpose of the camera movement. It accurately describes the static aspects of the shot but oversimplifies the dynamic ones.\n\nA more complete and accurate caption would be:\n\n**\"Shot from a low angle with a shallow depth of field, the camera starts on a close-up of a cybernetic figure's back. It then smoothly dollies backward while tilting down to reveal the character's masked face, capturing a moment of transformation.\"**",
