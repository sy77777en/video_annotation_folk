    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves forward, pans left, and then keeps moving forward to reveal a wider view of the street.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on the caption. It correctly identifies many key aspects of the shot, but there are some inaccuracies in the description of the camera movement.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n*   **Accuracy:**\n    *   **Correct:** The description of the camera's position (`eye level`, `level angle`), focus (`deep focus`, `large depth of field`), and steadiness (`slightly unsteady with some shaking`) is accurate.\n    *   **Incorrect:** The description of the camera's movement is not quite right. The camera does not move forward; it **dollies backward** (moves away from the scene) and **trucks left** (moves sideways to the left). This combined movement is what pulls the camera out from behind the foreground pole to reveal the wider street scene. A \"pan\" is a rotational movement on a fixed axis, whereas the camera here is physically translating through space.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is comprehensive, covering all the necessary elements like height, angle, focus, movement, and steadiness as requested by the instructions. It also correctly identifies the purpose of the movement (\"to reveal a wider view of the street\").\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres well to the instructions by being concise and focusing on the specified technical aspects. It correctly omits details about normal video speed and the absence of lens distortion.\n\n### Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised version of the caption that more accurately describes the camera movement:\n\n**The camera, positioned at eye level with a level angle, maintains deep focus. It slowly dollies backward and trucks left, moving out from behind a foreground pole to reveal a wider view of the residential street. The movement is slightly unsteady, indicating a handheld shot.**",
