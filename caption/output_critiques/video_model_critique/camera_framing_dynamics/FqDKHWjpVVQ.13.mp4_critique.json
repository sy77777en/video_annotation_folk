    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera represents the player's perspective, first moving slightly forward, then panning right, and ending with a forward movement.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent analysis. Here is a detailed breakdown of the provided caption's quality based on your instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\nThe caption is very good and accurately describes most of the camera's technical aspects. However, it could be improved by being more complete regarding the video's overall configuration.\n\n**Accuracy: Excellent**\n*   **Perspective, Height, and Angle:** \"first-person perspective,\" \"eye-level,\" and \"level angle\" are all perfectly accurate descriptions.\n*   **Movement:** The sequence of movements—\"moves slightly forward, then pans right, and finally moves forward again\"—is correct.\n*   **Steadiness:** \"unsteady with noticeable shaking\" is an accurate way to describe the simulated head-bob/weapon sway common in first-person games.\n*   **Focus:** \"deep focus with a large depth of field\" is correct. Video games often render everything in sharp focus by default, which is what is seen here.\n\n**Completeness: Good but Incomplete**\n*   The caption successfully describes the **camera's configuration** (angle, height, movement, focus).\n*   However, it falls short on describing the **video's configuration**. The most prominent feature of the video is that it is a screen recording of a first-person shooter video game. This is made explicit by the on-screen Heads-Up Display (HUD), which includes a minimap, ammo count, and objective markers. The instruction asks for a description of the \"video's... configuration,\" and omitting the clear video game context is a significant oversight.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions: Very Good**\n*   The caption correctly follows the instruction to be concise and to omit details about regular video speed, lack of lens distortion, and the absence of a Dutch angle.\n*   It describes the camera movements in the correct temporal order.\n*   It accurately identifies the focus characteristics.\n*   The main deviation from the instructions is the failure to provide a complete description of the video's configuration by not mentioning the video game elements.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is **good but not perfect**. It excels at describing the simulated cinematography but misses the fundamental context of the video itself.\n\nHere is a revised caption that better adheres to the instructions by including the missing information:\n\n**Improved Caption:**\n\"This screen recording of a first-person shooter video game is presented from an eye-level, level angle, with a prominent on-screen HUD. The camera, representing the player's view, moves slightly forward, pans right, and then moves forward again with an unsteady, shaking motion. The scene is rendered with a deep focus, keeping all elements sharp.\"",
