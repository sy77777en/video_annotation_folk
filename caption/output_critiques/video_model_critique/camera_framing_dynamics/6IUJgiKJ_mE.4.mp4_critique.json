    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves forward to follow the cyclists and adds a slight pan to the right at the end.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent analysis. Here is a detailed breakdown of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\nThe caption is a good attempt and correctly identifies several key cinematic elements. However, it contains one significant inaccuracy and could be improved with more precise terminology.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n\n*   **Correct:** The description of the camera angle (\"angled high, looking down\"), focus (\"deep focus with a large depth of field\"), and the forward movement with a \"slight pan to the right at the end\" are all accurate.\n*   **Incorrect:** The statement \"The camera is positioned at eye level\" is inaccurate. The camera is clearly positioned significantly higher than the cyclists' eye level, likely mounted on a support vehicle. A more accurate description would be a **high position** or **above eye-level**.\n*   **Partially Correct:** \"The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking\" is acceptable, but the instability is more of a high-frequency **vibration** (common with vehicle mounts) rather than a less consistent \"shaking.\"\n\n**Completeness & Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   The caption correctly omits mentions of video speed and lens distortion, as they are standard (normal speed, no distortion), which adheres to the instruction for conciseness.\n*   It successfully describes the angle, focus, and movement.\n*   While \"moves forward to follow\" is understandable, using the more technical term **tracking shot** would be more precise and in line with the detailed instructions provided.\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised caption that is more accurate and uses more precise terminology:\n\n**\"This is a high-angle tracking shot from a high position, following two cyclists from behind. The camera maintains deep focus, keeping the cyclists in the midground and the distant scenery sharp. The camera moves forward steadily with slight vibration, performing a minor pan to the right towards the end of the clip.\"**",
