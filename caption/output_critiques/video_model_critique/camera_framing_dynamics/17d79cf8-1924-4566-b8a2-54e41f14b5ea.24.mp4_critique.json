    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a bird's-eye view and transitions to an upside-down high-angle shot, indicating a first-person, head-mounted perspective. The camera is at eye level and uses deep focus with a large depth of field. It captures a first-person POV, rolling counterclockwise as the person turns left to place a brick on the wall. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The video begins with a bird's-eye view and transitions to an upside-down high-angle shot, suggesting a first-person, head-mounted perspective.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera captures a first-person POV with a bird's-eye view, rolling counterclockwise as the person turns left to place a brick on the wall. The movement is noticeably unsteady.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good for this video. It contains several significant inaccuracies and omissions, failing to adhere to the detailed instructions provided.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n### Accuracy:\n\n*   **Incorrect Description of Movement:** The caption incorrectly states the camera is \"**rolling counterclockwise**.\" A \"roll\" is a rotation around the lens's central axis (like a barrel roll). The movement shown is a **pan to the left** as the person turns their head.\n*   **Incorrect Description of Angle/Orientation:** The caption claims the video \"**transitions to an upside-down high-angle shot**.\" This is false. The camera's orientation remains upright throughout the clip. It simply pans left and tilts up slightly.\n*   **Misuse of \"Transitions\":** The caption uses the word \"transitions\" to describe a continuous camera movement within a single shot. In videography, a \"transition\" refers to a change from one shot to another (e.g., a hard cut, dissolve, or wipe). This is a single, uninterrupted shot.\n\n### Completeness:\n\n*   **Omission of Lens Distortion:** The video clearly exhibits **wide-angle or fisheye lens distortion**, causing the straight lines of the wall and the ground to appear curved. This is a prominent visual characteristic that the caption completely omits, despite the instructions specifically asking to describe it.\n*   **Incomplete Movement Description:** While it mentions the leftward turn, it fails to note the slight **upward tilt** as the person's gaze shifts from their hands to the wall where the brick is being placed.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions:\n\n*   The caption correctly identifies the **first-person POV**, **eye-level height**, **high angle**, and **deep focus**.\n*   It correctly notes the **unsteady** nature of the movement.\n*   However, it fails to follow the instructions by misidentifying the primary camera movement (pan vs. roll) and omitting the required description of lens distortion.\n\n### A Better Caption:\n\nHere is an example of a caption that accurately and completely follows the instructions:\n\n\"This first-person POV shot is filmed from a head-mounted camera at eye-level, resulting in a high-angle view. The shot exhibits noticeable **wide-angle lens distortion**, which curves straight lines at the edges of the frame. The camera, which is slightly unsteady, **pans left and tilts up slightly** as the person turns to place a brick on a wall. The focus is deep, keeping everything from the foreground hands to the midground wall sharp.\"",
