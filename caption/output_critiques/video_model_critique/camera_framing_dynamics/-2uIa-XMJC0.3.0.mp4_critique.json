    "pre_caption": "The camera is positioned at eye level and begins with a level angle, looking straight ahead. It then shifts to a low angle, looking up at the skateboarder. The camera uses deep focus, maintaining clarity across the scene. It slightly pans right to center the skateboarder and then moves forward to approach them. The movement is slightly unsteady, with some shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a level angle (looking straight ahead) and then changes to a low angle (looking up from below) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera slightly pans right to center the skateboarder, then moves forward to approach it.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent analysis. Here is a detailed breakdown of the provided caption's accuracy and adherence to the instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\nThe caption makes a good attempt to describe the shot but contains several significant inaccuracies regarding camera focus, angle, and movement terminology.\n\n*   **Accuracy:**\n    *   **Partially Accurate:** The description of the initial camera height (\"eye level\"), angle (\"level angle\"), forward movement (\"moves forward to approach them\"), and steadiness (\"slightly unsteady, with some shaking\") is correct.\n    *   **Inaccurate:** The claim that the camera \"shifts to a low angle\" is incorrect. The camera maintains a relatively level angle throughout the movement. The skateboarder is higher due to being on a ramp, but the camera itself does not tilt up to create a low-angle shot.\n    *   **Highly Inaccurate:** The statement that the camera \"uses deep focus, maintaining clarity across the scene\" is the most significant error. The shot clearly employs a **shallow depth of field**. This is evident from the large, heavily blurred green object in the foreground, which contrasts with the sharp focus on the skateboarder in the midground.\n    *   **Inaccurate Terminology:** The caption states the camera \"slightly pans right.\" A pan is a rotational movement on a fixed axis. In the video, the entire camera translates or **trucks right** while also dollying forward.\n\n*   **Completeness:**\n    *   The caption fails to mention the most prominent compositional element: the **over-the-shoulder framing**, indicated by the large, out-of-focus object in the foreground. This is crucial for understanding the shot's perspective.\n    *   It correctly identifies the primary subject and the general purpose of the movement (to approach the subject).\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   The caption attempts to follow the instructions by addressing angle, height, focus, and movement.\n    *   However, by using incorrect terms like \"deep focus\" and \"pan,\" it fails to provide an accurate description as required.\n\n### Corrected and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a more accurate caption that adheres to the provided instructions:\n\n**An over-the-shoulder shot begins at eye-level with a level angle. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the skateboarder in the midground sharp while the foreground is heavily blurred. The camera slowly and somewhat unsteadily dollies forward and trucks slightly to the right, moving closer to the skateboarder on the ramp.**",
