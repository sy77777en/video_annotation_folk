    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera slightly tilts down, then pans left. After panning, it remains static, ending with a slight forward movement.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on the caption. It correctly identifies several key aspects of the shot's configuration and follows the instructions well. Here is a detailed breakdown of its accuracy and completeness.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Caption:** \"This eye-level, level-angle shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera, moving smoothly, begins with a slight downward tilt before panning left to follow pedestrians walking past a vending machine. It then holds a static position before a subtle forward movement concludes the shot.\"\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **\"eye-level, level-angle shot\"**: **Correct.** The camera is held at a natural height and is parallel to the ground.\n*   **\"maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp\"**: **Correct.** Both the midground subjects and the background elements (like the food display) are in focus.\n*   **\"moving smoothly\"**: **Correct.** The movement is fluid, not shaky.\n*   **\"begins with a slight downward tilt\"**: **Incorrect.** The camera does not tilt down at the beginning. It maintains its level angle and performs a very slow truck/pan to the left.\n*   **\"panning left to follow pedestrians\"**: **Correct.** This is the most prominent movement in the middle of the shot.\n*   **\"It then holds a static position\"**: **Inaccurate.** The camera never truly becomes static. It is in continuous, slow motion, characteristic of being handheld by someone walking. The pause is too brief to be considered a static hold.\n*   **\"a subtle forward movement concludes the shot\"**: **Partially Correct.** There is a forward movement (a dolly-in), but it's part of the continuous walking motion rather than a distinct final action. The camera is also still trucking left as it moves forward.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully covers height, angle, focus, and movement as requested.\n*   It omits a description of the initial subjects (the two men in suits at the vending machine) and instead jumps to the subsequent pan.\n*   The description of the movement could be more holistic. The shot is best described as a continuous **truck left** (the camera operator is walking left) combined with a **pan left** to follow subjects. Breaking it into \"tilt,\" \"pan,\" \"static,\" and \"forward\" doesn't quite capture the fluid, single motion.\n\n### Suggested Improvement\n\nHere is a revised version that more accurately reflects the camera's movement:\n\n**Revised Caption:**\n\"This eye-level, level-angle shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera starts on two men at a vending machine and then smoothly trucks and pans left, following other pedestrians as they walk by. The shot concludes with this continuous, slow forward and leftward movement.\"",
