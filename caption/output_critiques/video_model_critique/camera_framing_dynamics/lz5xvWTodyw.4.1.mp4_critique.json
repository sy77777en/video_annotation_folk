    "pre_caption": "This very smooth aerial drone shot captures a city, featuring the Eiffel Tower and a red roller coaster, from a high angle. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the entire cityscape sharp. Initially, the camera moves upward, then tilts down and pans slightly left to offer a more direct overhead view of the city blocks and the coaster track.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The drone captures the city view from above, moving upward throughout. Midway, it tilts down to a high-angle view with a slight pan to the left.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly identifies the main subject as \"a series of red and white articulated buses.\" It is a single, continuous structure that more closely resembles a roller coaster train. This description should be corrected and made consistent, as the caption later contradicts itself by stating the structure \"resembles a roller coaster track.\" Additionally, calling this a \"drone shot\" is misleading. The on-screen text (\"ESC or START to end fly cam\") and the perfectly smooth motion indicate this is a simulated or virtual camera shot from a video game or 3D environment, which is a key aspect of the camera's configuration. Finally, the description of the movement as \"moves upward, then tilts down\" is an oversimplification of the simultaneous motion; a more accurate description would be that the camera \"cranes upward and dollies out while tilting down\" to reveal more of the scene.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This simulated aerial shot from a 3D environment, indicated by the \"fly cam\" text, captures a stylized cityscape resembling Paris, complete with the Eiffel Tower. A massive, continuous red roller coaster train is seen on a track that weaves intricately between the city blocks. The virtual camera cranes upward and dollies out while simultaneously tilting down and panning slightly left, revealing the vast scale of the coaster and offering a more direct overhead view. A deep focus keeps the entire sprawling scene, from the coaster in the foreground to the distant mountains, in sharp detail.",
