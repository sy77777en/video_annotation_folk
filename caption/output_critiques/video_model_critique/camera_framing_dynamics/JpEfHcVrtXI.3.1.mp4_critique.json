    "pre_caption": "The camera is positioned at an overhead level, roughly second-floor height, and maintains a level angle looking straight ahead. It tracks a video game character riding a bike from above and behind. The camera primarily moves forward, tailing the biker, but also trucks left and right to follow the biker's brief turns. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an overhead level (around second floor height).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera focus is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera tracks a person in a video game riding a bike forward from behind at an overhead level. For most of the video, it simply tails the biker, moving forward. However, as the biker briefly turns left and then right, the camera trucks left and right to follow.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tracking the subject from above and behind.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains several inaccuracies and omits a key camera movement. The description of the camera angle as \"level\" is incorrect; it is a high angle, looking down on the subject. The reference to \"second-floor height\" is an unhelpful real-world comparison for an abstract environment and should be removed. The statement that the camera becomes \"level with the subject\" on the slope is also inaccurate; it maintains its high-angle perspective while moving upward. Furthermore, the claim that the movement is \"unsteady with some shaking\" is false; the camera movement is perfectly smooth, as is typical for a game camera. The caption also fails to mention the most significant camera action: at the end of the clip, the camera cranes up and dollies out to reveal a large heart-shaped structure, a crucial change in framing. Finally, the caption omits any description of the focus, which should be noted as a deep focus where all elements are sharp, consistent with the game's art style.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a high angle, the camera looks down from behind a video game character on a motorcycle. It smoothly dollies forward, tracking the character's progress down the road, and trucks left and right to follow their movements. As the character approaches a ramp, the camera cranes up and dollies out to reveal a large, glowing, heart-shaped structure ahead. The shot maintains a deep focus throughout, keeping all elements of the stylized environment sharp and clear.",
