    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on the caption. It is accurate, concise, and adheres well to the instructions. Here is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is mostly accurate. The descriptions of the camera height (eye-level), angle (level), depth of field (shallow), and focus plane (midground) are all correct. However, the term \"static\" is not entirely precise. While the movement is very subtle, the camera is not perfectly still; it has the slight, natural sway of a handheld shot. A more accurate description would be \"mostly static\" or \"handheld with minimal movement.\"\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption effectively covers all the relevant aspects requested in the instructions. It correctly identifies the key visual characteristics of the shot without adding unnecessary information about elements that are not present (like lens distortion or speed changes).\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows the guidelines perfectly by providing a concise and informative description of the camera's configuration and focus.\n\n### Suggested Improvement\n\nTo enhance accuracy, the description of the camera's steadiness could be refined.\n\n**Original Caption:**\n> This is a static, eye-level shot with a level angle. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, focusing on the woman in the midground and blurring the living room behind her.\n\n**Revised Caption for Greater Accuracy:**\n> This is a **mostly static**, eye-level shot with a level angle. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, focusing on the woman in the midground and blurring the living room behind her.\n\nThis small change from \"static\" to \"mostly static\" acknowledges the subtle handheld quality of the shot, making the description more precise. Otherwise, your analysis is spot on.",
