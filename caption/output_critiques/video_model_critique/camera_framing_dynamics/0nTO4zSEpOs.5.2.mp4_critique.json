    "pre_caption": "The video begins with the camera at eye level, initially positioned at a high angle looking down. It then transitions to a level angle as the camera slightly moves backward. The camera smoothly pans 90 degrees to the left to face the road, tilts up to a level position, and moves forward. The focus remains deep with a large depth of field, ensuring all elements are sharp. The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a high angle (looking down from above) and then changes to a level angle (looking straight ahead) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera slightly moves backward, then pans 90 degrees to the left to face the road. It tilts up to a level position and moves forward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on this caption. It correctly identifies many key aspects of the camera work. Here is a detailed breakdown of its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\n\n*   **Mostly Accurate:** The description of the camera angles (starting high, transitioning to level), the general direction of movement (backward, pan left, forward), and the smoothness of the shot are all correct.\n*   **Minor Inaccuracy:**\n    *   The caption states the camera faces a \"road,\" but it is actually an indoor/covered hallway or corridor.\n    *   The statement that the focus \"remains deep\" is not entirely accurate. The video starts with a shallower depth of field, with the focus locked on the menu sign in the foreground, while the background is slightly blurred. The focus becomes deep only after the camera pans and begins moving down the hallway.\n\n**Completeness:**\n\n*   **Good, but could be more precise:** The caption describes the movements (moves backward, pans, moves forward) as separate actions. In the video, the initial backward dolly and the left pan are a single, fluid, arcing motion. Combining these would create a more precise description. For example: \"The camera pulls back and pans left in a smooth arc.\"\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Excellent:** The caption successfully follows the instructions by being concise and focusing on the specified attributes (angle, height, movement, focus). It correctly omits non-applicable details like lens distortion or altered video speed. The structure is logical, describing the shot chronologically.\n\n### Revised Caption for Improvement\n\nHere is a revised version that incorporates the feedback for greater accuracy and precision:\n\n**The video begins with a high-angle, eye-level shot focused on a lit menu sign, creating a shallow depth of field. The camera then pulls back and pans 90 degrees to the left in a single, smooth motion, simultaneously tilting up to a level angle. As it faces down a corridor, the focus shifts to become deep, keeping the entire hallway sharp. The camera then proceeds to dolly forward steadily down the corridor.**",
