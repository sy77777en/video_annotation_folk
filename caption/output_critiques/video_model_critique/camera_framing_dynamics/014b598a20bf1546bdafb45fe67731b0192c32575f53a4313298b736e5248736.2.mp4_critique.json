    "pre_caption": "The video is in slow motion, with the camera starting at hip level and moving to ground level. Initially, the camera is at a level angle, then shifts to a low angle, looking up. A varying Dutch angle is present due to camera rolling. The camera maintains deep focus with a large depth of field. It moves slowly downward while tilting up, focusing on the person in the Spider-Man costume. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A slow-motion video where playback speed is reduced, making actions appear slower than real-time.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees) and then moves to a ground level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a level angle (looking straight ahead) and then changes to a low angle (looking up from below) due to camera motion. The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving down and tilting up.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on the caption. It correctly identifies several key aspects of the shot. Here is a detailed breakdown of its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **Correct:** The identification of **slow motion**, the **downward camera movement**, the **upward tilt**, the **deep focus/large depth of field**, and the **slight unsteadiness** are all accurate.\n*   **Correct:** The description of a **varying Dutch angle** due to camera rolling is also correct and a good observation.\n*   **Partially Incorrect:** The description of the camera height is reasonable (\"hip level to ground level\").\n*   **Incorrect:** The description of the camera angle is inaccurate. The camera **starts at a low angle** and moves to an even lower **worm's-eye angle**. It is never at a \"level angle.\"\n\n**Completeness & Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Major Omission:** The caption completely omits the most significant visual characteristic of the video: the **strong lens distortion**. The wide-angle or fisheye lens causes the straight lines of the gazebo and background buildings to curve dramatically. The instructions specifically ask to describe this if present.\n*   **Minor Omission:** While \"moves slowly downward while tilting up\" is good, using a more specific term like \"craning down\" could make the description more concise and professional.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is good but has one significant inaccuracy (the camera angle) and one major omission (the lens distortion). By correcting the angle description and adding the lens distortion, the caption would be a much more accurate and complete representation of the video's technical aspects.\n\n### Revised Example Caption\n\nHere is a revised version that incorporates the feedback:\n\n\"This slow-motion shot features prominent **fisheye lens distortion**, which curves the background. The camera starts at a **low angle** and **cranes down** to ground level, tilting up into a **worm's-eye view**. This slow, slightly unsteady movement creates a varying Dutch angle and keeps the entire scene in **deep focus**, emphasizing the subject in the Spider-Man costume.\"",
