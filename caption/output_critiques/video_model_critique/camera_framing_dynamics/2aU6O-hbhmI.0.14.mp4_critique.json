    "pre_caption": "The video features noticeable fisheye distortion, curving straight lines outward. The camera is at an aerial level, transitioning from a 90-degree rotated angle to a high angle, then back to a level angle. It maintains deep focus with a large depth of field. The drone executes skilled, complex maneuvers, diving downward before leveling its view, with pronounced rolling movements. The camera movement is very smooth, with no shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features noticable fisheye distortion causing straight lines to curve outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle transitions from a 90-degree rotated level angle to a high angle, and then back to a level angle.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The drone performs skilled, complex maneuvers, diving downward before leveling its view, accompanied by pronounced rolling movements.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "### Feedback on the Caption\n\nThis is an excellent caption that is highly accurate, comprehensive, and perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **Lens Distortion:** The identification of \"fishefenye distortion\" is spot-on. The wide-angle lens used on the drone creates a distinct curvature, especially visible in the buildings and horizon.\n*   **Camera Angle & Height:** The description is very accurate. The shot is indeed at an \"aerial level.\" It begins with a severe Dutch angle (\"90-degree rotated angle\"), then transitions through a high-angle dive, and finally adjusts to a more \"level angle\" relative to its flight path as it skims over the construction site.\n*   **Focus:** The \"deep focus with a large depth of field\" is correctly identified. Everything from the nearby structures to the distant skyline is sharp, which is typical for this type of action camera/drone setup.\n*   **Movement:** The description of the movement is superb. \"Skilled, complex maneuvers,\" \"diving downward,\" \"leveling its view,\" and \"pronounced rolling movements\" perfectly capture the dynamic and acrobatic nature of the FPV drone flight. The smoothness and lack of shaking are also correctly noted.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully covers all the key visual characteristics of the video as outlined in the instructions: lens distortion, camera position (height and angle), focus, and the complex nature of the camera movement.\n*   It correctly omits mention of video speed, as the clip appears to be in real-time, following the instruction to not mention standard playback speed.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   The caption is concise yet packed with relevant information.\n*   It uses precise terminology (fisheye, aerial level, rolling) to describe the technical aspects of the shot.\n*   It effectively summarizes a complex, multi-axis movement in a clear and understandable way.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is exemplary. It demonstrates a strong understanding of cinematography terms and applies them accurately to analyze the video clip, resulting in a description that is both technically detailed and easy to understand. No improvements are necessary.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This smooth, aerial FPV drone shot showcases skilled, complex maneuvers. The camera begins at a 90-degree rotated angle and executes a pronounced roll as it dives downward, transitioning to a high angle before leveling its view. The shot is characterized by noticeable fisheye distortion and maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field throughout the dynamic movement.",
