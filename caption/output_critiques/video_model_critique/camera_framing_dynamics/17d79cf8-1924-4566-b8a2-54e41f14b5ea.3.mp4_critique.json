    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a first-person perspective at hip level, looking almost straight down at the ground with an upside-down high angle. As the person stands and turns, the camera moves upward to eye level, rolling counterclockwise with noticeable shaking. The angle transitions to a bird's-eye view by the end. The camera maintains deep focus with a large depth of field throughout, capturing the scene clearly despite the slight unsteadiness.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees) and then moves to an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The video begins with an upside-down high angle, looking down at the ground, suggesting a first-person, head-mounted perspective. By the end, the camera transitions to a bird's-eye view.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The first-person camera initially looks almost straight down at the ground. As the person stands up and turns around, the camera moves upward and rolls counterclockwise with noticeable shaking.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good for this video because it contains significant inaccuracies and omits a key visual element required by the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the caption's issues:\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   **Incorrect Angle Description:** The phrase \"upside-down high angle\" is not a standard cinematographic term and is confusing. The camera is simply pointed straight down, creating a **bird's-eye view** of the ground below.\n*   **Incorrect Movement Description:** The caption states the camera is \"rolling counterclockwise.\" In the video, as the person turns left, the right side of the frame rises and the left side lowers, which is a **clockwise roll**.\n*   **Misleading Height Description:** While the camera ends up at eye level, describing the start as \"hip level\" is ambiguous. The camera is likely mounted on the person's chest or head and is tilted down. A more accurate description would focus on the camera's low starting position (due to the person crouching or bending) and its upward movement.\n\n### Completeness\n\n*   **Omission of Lens Distortion:** The video clearly exhibits significant **barrel distortion** (or fisheye distortion) from a wide-angle lens, causing straight lines near the edges of the frame to appear curved. This is a prominent visual characteristic and a required element in the instructions, but the caption fails to mention it.\n*   **Vague Movement Terminology:** The caption uses general terms like \"moves upward\" and \"turns.\" The instructions encourage more specific terms like **pedestaling up** (for the vertical movement) and **panning** or **rotating** (for the turn).\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   The caption fails to adhere to the instruction to \"describe the type and degree\" of **lens distortion** if present.\n*   By providing incorrect information about the camera's movement (the direction of the roll), it fails to accurately describe the shot as instructed.\n\n### A Better Caption\n\nHere is an example of a more accurate and complete caption that adheres to the instructions:\n\n\"This first-person POV shot, filmed with a wide-angle lens causing noticeable **barrel distortion**, begins from a low height with a **bird's-eye view** of the ground. As the person stands and turns left, the camera **pedestals up** to what becomes eye-level, **panning** with the body's rotation. The movement is moderately shaky and includes a distinct **clockwise roll**. The shot maintains a **deep focus**, keeping everything from the feet in the foreground to the surrounding bricks in the midground sharp and clear.\"",
