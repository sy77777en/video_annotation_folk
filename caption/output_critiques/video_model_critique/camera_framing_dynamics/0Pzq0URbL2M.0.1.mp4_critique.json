    "pre_caption": "The video features a camera at eye level with a level angle, employing deep focus for a large depth of field. It begins with a slight pan to the left, focusing on a man in a lab coat working at a counter. The camera then smoothly moves backward, maintaining steadiness throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera starts with a slight pan to the left, then smoothly moves backward throughout the video.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent analysis. Here is a detailed breakdown of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\nThe caption is a good attempt and correctly identifies several key aspects of the shot, but it mischaracterizes the camera movement, which is a crucial element of the scene.\n\n*   **Accuracy:**\n    *   **Correct:** The description of the camera being at **eye level** with a **level angle** is accurate.\n    *   **Correct:** The identification of **deep focus** (large depth of field) is also accurate, as most of the room remains sharp.\n    *   **Incorrect:** The caption states the camera \"begins with a slight pan to the left.\" This is inaccurate. A **pan** is a rotational movement on a fixed axis. The camera here is moving through space, not just rotating.\n    *   **Incomplete:** Describing the subsequent movement as \"smoothly moves backward\" is only partially correct. The camera does move backward (**dolly out**), but it also moves sideways to the left (**trucks left**). This combined diagonal movement is what reveals the lockers and the desk on the left side of the frame.\n\n*   **Completeness:**\n    *   The caption covers height, angle, focus, and movement, which are the main dynamic elements.\n    *   It correctly omits standard features like regular video speed and lack of lens distortion, adhering to the conciseness instruction.\n    *   However, the description of the movement is incomplete and lacks the precision required by the instructions.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   The caption follows the instruction to be concise and to describe the camera's configuration.\n    *   It fails, however, to use the correct terminology for camera movement (pan vs. dolly/truck), which is a key part of the instructions.\n\n### Suggested Improvement\n\nHere is a more accurate and detailed caption that adheres to the instructions:\n\n**\"Shot at eye-level with a level angle and deep focus, the video opens on a man in a lab. The camera then performs a slow, steady dolly backward while simultaneously trucking to the left, a smooth movement that widens the view to reveal more of the laboratory environment.\"**",
