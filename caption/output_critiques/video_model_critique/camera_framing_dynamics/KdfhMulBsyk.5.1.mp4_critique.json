    "pre_caption": "The video exhibits mild barrel distortion. Filmed from an aerial, bird's-eye view, the entire scene is blurry. The camera, likely a drone, continuously ascends. During this ascent, it rolls counterclockwise to align a road parallel to the frame, continues its upward movement, and then rolls counterclockwise again, all while maintaining its ascent. The camera movement is very smooth.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features mild barrel distortion causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a bird's-eye view angle (looking down directly at the ground).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The entire video is blurry, making it hard to determine the type of focus.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The drone continuously flies upward while maintaining a downward bird’s-eye view. During the ascent, it rolls counterclockwise to align the road parallel to the frame, continues flying upward, and then rolls counterclockwise again while still ascending.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption omits the beginning of the shot, where the camera starts behind a dark, scalloped foreground object and pulls back to reveal the city. The description of the camera movement is also slightly inaccurate; rather than performing two separate rolls, the camera executes a single, continuous counterclockwise roll as it ascends. The camera angle is not static but transitions from a high angle to a bird's-eye view. The phrase \"likely a drone\" is speculative and should be removed, as the video is animated. Finally, while \"blurry\" is accurate, a more descriptive term like \"soft focus\" or \"extremely shallow depth of field\" would better characterize the visual style.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The shot opens from behind a dark, scalloped foreground object, pulling back and ascending to reveal a vibrant, neon-lit cityscape at night. As the camera moves, its angle transitions from a high angle to a bird's-eye view. The camera performs a single, smooth, continuous counterclockwise roll throughout its ascent, aligning the road horizontally within the frame. The entire animated scene is rendered in a soft focus with an extremely shallow depth of field and exhibits mild barrel distortion.",
