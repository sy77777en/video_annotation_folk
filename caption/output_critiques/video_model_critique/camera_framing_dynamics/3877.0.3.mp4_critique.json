    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The video features a man suspended in the air, but the camera's height is unclear due to the zoomed-in frame and lack of background cues.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on the caption. It correctly identifies several key technical aspects of the shot. Here is a detailed breakdown of its accuracy and adherence to the instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **\"captured at a level angle\"**: This is accurate. The camera is positioned at roughly the same height as the man's head, creating a level perspective.\n*   **\"The camera employs a shallow depth of field, focusing on the man in the foreground\"**: This is perfectly accurate. The man's face is in sharp focus, while the mountains behind him are significantly blurred, indicating a shallow depth of field.\n*   **\"Although the camera is fixed, it exhibits slight unsteadiness without intentional movement\"**: This phrasing is slightly contradictory. A \"fixed\" or \"static\" camera implies no movement at all. The camera in the video is clearly not on a locked-down tripod; it has a subtle, organic wobble, characteristic of a handheld shot or a camera mounted on a moving person. Describing it as \"unsteady\" is correct, but calling it \"fixed\" is inaccurate.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully covers the camera angle, focus/depth of field, and stability.\n*   It correctly omits details about video speed, lens distortion, and Dutch angle, as they are standard or not present, which adheres to the conciseness instruction.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   The caption is concise and focuses on the requested technical elements.\n*   The primary issue is the description of the camera's movement. The instructions state, \"If the camera is static, simply state that the shot is static.\" Since this camera is not static, it should be described based on its movement (or lack of stability) without using the term \"fixed.\"\n\n### Suggested Improvement\n\nTo improve accuracy, the description of the camera's stability should be rephrased to avoid the contradiction.\n\n**Revised Caption Example:**\n\nA close-up, eye-level shot captures a man against a mountainous backdrop. The camera is mostly stationary but exhibits a slight, handheld-style unsteadiness. A shallow depth of field keeps the man in sharp focus while blurring the mountains in the background.",
