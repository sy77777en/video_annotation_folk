    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves forward while panning to the right, then continues straight in the same direction.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on the caption. It correctly identifies several key aspects of the shot. Here is a detailed breakdown of its accuracy and completeness:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n*   **Accuracy:**\n    *   **\"The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle...\"**: This is accurate. The perspective is that of a person walking, and the horizon is not tilted.\n    *   **\"...capturing the scene with deep focus and a large depth of field.\"**: This is also accurate. All elements, from the wooden blocks in the foreground to the end of the corridor in the background, are in sharp focus.\n    *   **\"It moves forward smoothly while panning to the right...\"**: This correctly describes the initial part of the camera's motion. It is a combined dolly forward and pan right.\n    *   **\"...then continues straight in the same direction...\"**: This part is inaccurate. The camera does not continue straight down the original path. Instead, the combined forward dolly and right pan create a smooth, arcing motion that brings the camera closer to the restaurant entrance on the right side of the corridor. The final movement is a slow push-in towards the entrance.\n\n*   **Completeness & Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   The caption correctly omits details about video speed and lens distortion, as they are standard.\n    *   It successfully describes the camera height, angle, and focus.\n    *   The description of the movement is good but lacks precision regarding the final part of the motion and its purpose. The movement is a single, continuous action designed to shift the viewer's focus from the general corridor to the specific restaurant entrance, which isn't fully conveyed.\n\n### Suggested Improvement\n\nHere is a revised version of the caption that more accurately describes the camera's movement:\n\n**Revised Caption:** \"Positioned at eye level with a level angle, the camera captures the scene in deep focus. It executes a single, smooth movement, dollying forward down the corridor while simultaneously panning right, effectively arcing to push in and focus on the restaurant entrance on the right.\"",
