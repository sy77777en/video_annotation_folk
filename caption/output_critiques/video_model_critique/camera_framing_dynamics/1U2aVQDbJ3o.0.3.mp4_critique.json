    "pre_caption": "The video features a drone camera starting at eye level and moving to hip level. It begins with a high angle, transitioning to a level angle, with a varying Dutch angle due to rolling. The camera maintains deep focus with a large depth of field. It smoothly tracks a drifting race car, arcing clockwise and craning up and down to enhance motion. The movement is very smooth, with no shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts at an eye level (above the waist) and then moves to a hip level (below the waist and above the knees).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a high angle (looking down from above) and then changes to a level angle (looking straight ahead) due to camera motion. The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The drone performs dynamic maneuvers, tracking the drifting race car from above. It arcs clockwise around the car, craning up and then down to shift angles and amplify the sense of motion.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tracking the subject while arcing around them.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent attempt at a detailed caption. You've correctly identified several key cinematic techniques. However, there are some significant inaccuracies regarding the camera's position and a few missed details.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of your caption's accuracy and completeness:\n\n### Caption Feedback\n\n**\"The video features a drone camera...\"**\n*   **Accuracy:** Correct. The fluid, low-to-the-ground, high-speed movements are characteristic of an FPV (First-Person View) drone.\n\n**\"...starting at eye level and moving to hip level.\"**\n*   **Accuracy:** Incorrect. The camera never reaches eye level. It remains very low throughout, starting at **ground level** in the first shot and staying between **ground and hip level** for the rest of the video. This low perspective is crucial for exaggerating the car's speed and presence.\n\n**\"It begins with a high angle, transitioning to a level angle...\"**\n*   **Accuracy:** Incorrect. The video consistently uses **low angles** and **level angles**. The opening shot is a low angle looking slightly up at the car's hood. Subsequent shots are also low or level, emphasizing the car's power by making it look imposing. There are no high-angle shots where the camera looks down on the car.\n\n**\"...with a varying Dutch angle due to rolling.\"**\n*   **Accuracy:** Correct. This is an excellent observation. The camera frequently rolls along its axis, tilting the horizon to match the dynamic energy of the drifting car.\n\n**\"The camera maintains deep focus with a large depth of field.\"**\n*   **Accuracy:** Correct. Everything from the car to the snowy background is technically in focus, which is typical for the wide-angle lenses used on FPV drones. The significant blur you see is **motion blur** caused by the high speed of the camera and subject, not a shallow depth of field.\n\n**\"It smoothly tracks a drifting race car, arcing clockwise and craning up and down to enhance motion.\"**\n*   **Accuracy:** Correct. You've accurately described the complex and purposeful camera movements. The camera isn't just following; it's actively dancing with the car.\n\n**\"The movement is very smooth, with no shaking.\"**\n*   **Accuracy:** Correct. The footage is exceptionally stable, which highlights the skill of the drone pilot.\n\n### Summary and Suggestions for Improvement\n\n*   **Strengths:** You correctly identified the use of a drone, the dynamic rolling (Dutch angle), the deep focus, and the complex tracking, arcing, and craning movements.\n*   **Areas for Improvement:** The primary errors are in identifying the camera height and angle. The shot's power comes from its consistently low perspective.\n*   **Completeness:** To be more complete according to the instructions, you could also mention:\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** The video is a montage of several dynamic shots linked by **hard cuts**.\n    *   **Motion Blur:** The prominent motion blur is a key visual characteristic that conveys extreme speed.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is a slight **barrel distortion** visible, especially in the first shot, which is common with the wide lenses used on these drones.\n\n### Revised, More Accurate Caption:\n\nHere is an example of a more accurate caption based on the instructions:\n\n\"This video, composed of several hard cuts, is filmed with a low-altitude FPV drone. The camera remains at **ground to hip level**, utilizing **low and level angles** to capture a Porsche drifting on snow. The footage is characterized by high-speed, smooth, and complex movements, including rapid tracking, arcing around the car, and rolling, which creates a constantly varying Dutch angle. The camera maintains a deep depth of field, while significant motion blur emphasizes the extreme speed.\"",
