    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves forward toward the man eating noodles, panning right to maintain focus on him.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent analysis. Here is a detailed breakdown of the caption's performance:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\nThe caption is mostly accurate and follows the instructions well, but it contains a key inaccuracy regarding the camera movement.\n\n*   **Accuracy:**\n    *   **Correct:** The description of the camera's configuration (`eye level`, `level angle`), focus (`shallow depth of field`), and focus plane (`midground`) is perfectly accurate.\n    *   **Incorrect:** The description of the camera movement is flawed. The caption states the camera \"moves forward... panning right.\" While the camera does move forward (a dolly-in), the sideways movement is a **truck right** (a physical translation sideways), not a **pan right** (a rotation on a fixed axis). The camera's entire position shifts diagonally forward and to the right to keep the subject centered.\n\n*   **Completeness:**\n    *   The caption successfully covers the most relevant aspects of the shot as required by the instructions: height, angle, focus, and movement.\n    *   It correctly and concisely omits details that are not present, such as video speed changes, lens distortion, or Dutch angles.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   The caption adheres well to the formatting and content requirements. It is concise and focuses on the specified technical details.\n    *   The primary failure in adherence is the use of incorrect terminology for the camera movement, which is a critical element of the instructions.\n\n### Corrected Caption Example\n\nHere is a more accurate version of the caption:\n\n**The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle. Using a shallow depth of field, the shot focuses on a man eating noodles in the midground. The camera executes a smooth, slow diagonal movement, simultaneously dollying forward and trucking right to keep the man centered in the frame.**",
