    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an overhead level (around second floor height).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward, moving down, panning right, and moving left.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This caption provides a detailed and accurate description of the shot's cinematography, adhering closely to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its accuracy and completeness:\n\n*   **Accuracy:**\n    *   **Angle:** The description of a \"high, overhead angle\" is accurate. The camera is positioned significantly above the subjects, looking down.\n    *   **Focus:** \"deep focus, keeping all the figures sharp\" is correct. The entire scene, from the foreground lectern to the figures in the back, remains in sharp focus, which is characteristic of this type of computer-generated imagery.\n    *   **Movement:** The breakdown of the camera's motion is exceptionally precise. It correctly identifies the simultaneous movements: dollying forward (\"moving forward\"), pedestaling/craning down (\"down\"), trucking left (\"left\"), and panning right. This complex combination is perfectly summarized as a \"slow, descending arc.\"\n    *   **Speed & Steadiness:** The terms \"smooth\" and \"slow\" accurately describe the quality and pace of the camera movement.\n\n*   **Completeness & Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   The caption successfully covers all the required elements: camera angle, movement (translation, rotation, arcing, speed, complexity), and focus.\n    *   It correctly omits unnecessary information, such as the normal video speed and the absence of lens distortion or a Dutch angle, making it concise as instructed.\n    *   The description of the movement is comprehensive, detailing both the individual components and the overall effect (\"descending arc\").\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is excellent. It is technically precise, well-written, and perfectly fulfills the requirements of the prompt by providing a concise yet thorough analysis of the camera's configuration and movement.",
