    "pre_caption": "Positioned at hip level, the camera maintains a level angle and uses a shallow depth of field to focus on the girl in the midground. The camera smoothly moves forward toward her, then begins to arc subtly clockwise around her.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves forward to focus on the girl initially, then subtly arcs clockwise around her.\n\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on this caption. It is largely accurate and follows the instructions well. Here is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n*   **Accuracy:**\n    *   **Mostly Accurate:** The description of the camera angle (`level angle`), depth of field (`shallow depth of field`), focus plane (`midground`), and movement (`smoothly moves forward... arc subtly clockwise`) is perfect. These observations correctly capture the technical and artistic choices of the shot.\n    *   **Minor Inaccuracy:** The term `hip level` is slightly inaccurate. Since the subjects are seated, the camera is positioned closer to their **chest level** or **eye-level relative to their seated position**. \"Hip level\" would imply a much lower camera placement.\n\n*   **Completeness:**\n    *   The caption is very complete, successfully identifying and describing the most important aspects of the shot as required by the instructions. It correctly combines the description of the dolly-in and the arc into a clear, sequential sentence. It also correctly identifies the focus strategy.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   The caption is concise and informative.\n    *   It correctly omits unnecessary information like normal video speed and the absence of lens distortion.\n    *   It uses the specified terminology (e.g., `level angle`, `shallow depth of field`, `arc clockwise`) appropriately.\n\n### Suggested Improvement\n\nFor greater accuracy, you could revise the camera height description.\n\n**Revised Caption Example:**\n\n\"Positioned at **chest-level** relative to the seated subjects, the camera maintains a level angle and uses a shallow depth of field to focus on the girl in the midground. The camera smoothly moves forward toward her, then begins to arc subtly clockwise around her.\"",
