    "pre_caption": "The video features a camera at eye level, initially using a low angle and transitioning to a high angle. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera smoothly tilts down at varying speeds, slightly panning left to follow a child in a white uniform jumping from a height onto a platform, causing the subject to appear larger in the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** It appears to shift from a level angle to a high angle, but due to the lack of clear background information, it's difficult to determine. However, the camera's noticeable tilting-down movement can be observed.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera intermittently tilts down at varying speeds to track a child in a white uniform jumping from a height onto a platform, while slightly panning left.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tilting downward to track the subject. During the tracking shot, the subject becomes larger in the frame.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work. The caption attempts to follow the instructions, but it contains several significant inaccuracies regarding the on-screen action and the camera's effect.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\n\n*   **Partially Accurate:** The description of the camera employing a \"smooth tilt down\" and \"slightly panning left\" to follow the subject is correct. The camera is likely at \"eye level,\" and it does transition from a low angle (relative to the subject's initial position) to a high angle (relative to their final position).\n*   **Inaccurate:**\n    1.  **Action:** The most significant error is the description of the action. The person jumps *down from* the white beam onto the stage floor; they do not jump *onto* a platform.\n    2.  **Subject Size:** The claim that the movement causes \"the subject to appear larger in the frame\" is incorrect. The camera is tilting, not zooming or dollying in. The subject's size in the frame remains relatively consistent.\n    3.  **Movement Speed:** Describing the tilt as having \"varying speeds\" is an overstatement. The tilt appears to move at a smooth, consistent speed to match the subject's fall.\n    4.  **Focus:** While \"deep focus\" is plausible since the foreground projection and midground subject are both sharp, the background is pure black, making a definitive statement about a \"large depth of field\" difficult. A more conservative description would be that the focus is fixed on the midground.\n\n**Completeness:**\n\n*   The caption covers the key aspects requested: angle, height, focus, and movement.\n*   It correctly omits non-existent features like lens distortion or video speed changes.\n*   It could be more precise by explicitly stating that the camera's physical position is **static** (i.e., it only rotates via tilt/pan and does not move through space).\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   The caption follows the format and addresses the specific technical elements required by the instructions. However, its failure to accurately describe the visual information undermines its quality.\n\n### Revised, More Accurate Caption\n\nHere is a more accurate caption that adheres to the instructions:\n\n\"This is a static, eye-level shot. The camera smoothly tilts down and pans slightly left to track a performer in a white suit as they jump down from a high beam onto the stage. The focus remains fixed on the performer in the midground, and the shot maintains a clear image of both the subject and a projected graphic in the foreground.\"",
