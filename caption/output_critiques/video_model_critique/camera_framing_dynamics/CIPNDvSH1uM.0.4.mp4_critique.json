    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving left.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is moving leftward to track the subject from the side.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on providing a detailed set of instructions for the caption. Here is a thorough evaluation of the provided caption based on those instructions.\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\nThe provided caption is **inaccurate and incomplete**. While it correctly identifies some basic aspects of the shot, it fundamentally misinterprets the camera's movement and completely omits the most significant visual events in the clip.\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\n\n*   **\"the camera trucks left, tracking the driver\"**: This is the most significant error. The camera is **not trucking left**. It is positioned statically *inside* a moving vehicle (likely in the passenger seat). The illusion of a leftward truck is created by the background scenery moving past the car from right to left. The camera is not actively tracking the driver; it maintains a fixed frame on the driver's seat.\n*   **\"slightly unsteady, eye-level perspective\"**: This part is accurate. The shot is at the subject's eye level and has a slight vibration consistent with being in a moving car.\n*   **\"deep focus\"**: This is reasonably accurate. While the background is not perfectly sharp, it is clearly discernible, so describing it as deep focus is acceptable. A more precise term might be \"medium-deep depth of field,\" with the focus plane on the driver in the midground.\n\n**Completeness:**\n\n*   **Missing Transitions and Subject Changes**: The caption completely fails to mention the central action of the video: the rapid, morphing transformations of the driver. The clip shows a boy, a goblin-like monster, a reptilian monster, and a young man, all transitioning in the same shot. According to the instructions, these transitions and the changing subjects should have been described.\n*   **Incomplete Movement Description**: The caption fails to describe the actual camera situation, which is a static shot from within a moving vehicle.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   The caption fails to follow the instruction to \"describe the camera framing and movement in each segment separately\" when transitions occur. It treats the entire sequence as one continuous, unchanging shot, which ignores the dramatic changes in the subject.\n*   It is concise, but this conciseness comes at the expense of crucial information and accuracy, which violates the primary goal of providing an \"informative description.\"\n\n### Corrected and Improved Caption\n\nHere is an example of a caption that more accurately and completely follows your instructions:\n\n\"The shot is filmed from a static, slightly unsteady, eye-level position inside a moving car, framed on the driver from the passenger seat's perspective. The video uses a series of rapid morphing effects to transform the driver's appearance. Initially, a young boy is at the wheel; he then transforms into a goblin-like creature, a reptilian monster, and finally a young man. Throughout these transformations, the camera's framing and position remain constant. The focus is fixed on the driver in the midground, maintaining a medium-deep depth of field that keeps the background scenery visible but slightly soft.\"",
