    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on the caption. It accurately captures several key aspects of the shot. Here is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is mostly accurate. The camera is indeed smooth, at roughly eye level, and maintains a level angle. The description of the deep focus and large depth of field is also correct.\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is good but slightly incomplete regarding the camera movement. While it correctly identifies the \"forward-moving\" (dolly in) aspect, it misses that the camera is also moving horizontally to the right (trucking right) at the same time. This combined movement creates a diagonal or slightly arcing path that reveals more of the station beyond the turnstiles.\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres well to the instructions. It is concise and focuses on the specified technical elements, correctly omitting details like video speed and lens distortion since they are standard.\n\n### Suggested Improvement\n\nTo be more precise, the description of the movement could be refined.\n\n**Original:**\n> The video features a smooth forward-moving camera at eye level, maintaining a level angle.\n\n**Improved Version:**\n> The video features a slow, smooth camera shot at eye level with a level angle. The camera simultaneously dollies forward and trucks to the right, moving past the turnstiles.\n\nThis change more accurately describes the camera's path and provides a more complete picture of the cinematography. Otherwise, your analysis of the focus and depth of field is perfect.",
