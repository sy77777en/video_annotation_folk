    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera focus is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent attempt. The caption correctly identifies that the camera is static and what the subject of the video is. However, it misses several key technical details required by the instructions and includes some subjective description that is not requested.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n*   **Accuracy:**\n    *   **\"The video is static with no camera movement.\"** - This is **accurate**. The camera's position and framing are fixed throughout the shot.\n    *   **\"The focus is on the yellow ink dispersing in the water...\"** - This is **accurate** in identifying the subject but could be more specific about the focus properties (depth of field, focus plane).\n\n*   **Completeness (Adherence to Instructions):**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The caption **misses** a crucial detail. The video is in **slow-motion**, which is why the ink's movement appears so graceful and detailed. The instructions explicitly ask to specify this.\n    *   **Camera Angle/Height:** The caption does not mention the **level angle** from which the shot is taken.\n    *   **Focus:** While it mentions what is in focus, it doesn't describe the **depth of field**. In this case, the depth of field is relatively shallow, as the background is a uniform white with no detail, keeping the focus entirely on the ink.\n    *   **Conciseness vs. Information:** The phrase \"...creating a vivid and dynamic visual effect against a white background\" is an aesthetic observation. While true, the instructions ask for a technical description of the camera's configuration, not a subjective interpretation of the visuals.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is a good starting point but is incomplete. It fails to provide key information about the video speed and camera angle and includes subjective commentary instead of sticking to the requested technical specifications.\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised caption that more closely follows the instructions:\n\n**\"This slow-motion, static shot is captured from a level angle. The focus is fixed on the midground, where the yellow ink billows and expands. The depth of field is shallow, isolating the ink against a uniform white background.\"**",
