    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work. The caption correctly identifies the camera's height, angle, and forward movement. However, it could be improved with more precise terminology and detail.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n\n*   **\"The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, looking straight ahead.\"**: This is accurate. The camera is positioned behind the subject at roughly their shoulder/head height and is not tilted up or down.\n*   **\"It uses deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping all elements sharp.\"**: This is partially inaccurate. \"Deep focus\" is a specific cinematic term where elements in the foreground, midground, and background are all in sharp focus. In this shot, there are no distinct foreground elements, and the low lighting makes it difficult to assess the background's sharpness definitively. While the depth of field is not shallow, calling it \"deep focus\" is likely an overstatement. A more accurate description would be a \"moderate\" or \"large depth of field.\"\n*   **\"The camera moves forward smoothly, focusing on the person in the foreground.\"**: The camera does move forward, but \"smoothly\" doesn't fully capture the subtle, natural waver of a handheld or shoulder-mounted shot. Also, the person is in the **midground**, not the foreground.\n\n**Completeness:**\n\n*   The caption correctly identifies the forward movement but doesn't specify its type (e.g., **dolly-in** or **push-in**) or its slow, deliberate **speed**.\n*   It misses describing the **steadiness** of the shot, which is mostly steady but has a slight handheld quality.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   The caption follows the structure well but lacks the precision required for terms like \"deep focus\" and \"foreground.\" It could be more descriptive about the nature of the movement.\n\n**Revised Caption Example:**\n\nA steady, eye-level shot from behind a person slowly dollies forward. The focus is kept on the person's back in the midground, with a moderate depth of field that keeps the background wall relatively clear.",
