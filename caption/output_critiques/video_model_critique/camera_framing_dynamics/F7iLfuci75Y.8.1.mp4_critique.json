    "pre_caption": "From a smooth, hip-level perspective, the camera moves forward at a level angle. As it approaches a large vault-like door, it performs a quick right pan to reorient itself. Following the pan, the camera continues its forward motion while gradually descending. The video begins with a shallow depth of field, focusing on the door, before transitioning to a deep focus that brings the figures working at computers in the background into sharp view.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The video begins with a shallow focus with the middle ground in focus. As the camera moves, it transitions into a deep focus with all elements visible.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves forward continuously, quickly panning right to adjust its orientation as it nears the door. After the pan, it gradually descends while maintaining its forward motion.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent attempt at a detailed and structured caption. The description captures the general flow of the camera work well, but there are a few key technical terms that could be more precise to improve accuracy.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n*   **Accuracy:**\n    *   The description of the initial forward movement, smoothness, and height is accurate.\n    *   The term \"**pan**\" is used incorrectly. A pan is a rotational movement where the camera pivots horizontally from a fixed point. In the video, the entire camera moves laterally to the right to clear the doorframe. The correct term for this sideways movement is a **truck** or **dolly right**.\n    *   The description of the focus change as a transition to \"**deep focus**\" is inaccurate. Deep focus means that elements in the foreground, midground, and background are all in sharp focus simultaneously. What occurs here is a **rack focus** (or focus pull), where the plane of sharp focus shifts from the midground (the vault door) to the background (the figures at the computers), while the new foreground (the door frame) becomes blurry. The depth of field remains shallow throughout the shot; only the point of focus changes.\n\n*   **Completeness:**\n    *   The caption successfully covers the main aspects of movement (translation, rotation), height, and focus as requested.\n    *   It correctly identifies the purpose of the movement—to reveal the room behind the door.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   The caption follows the instructions well by describing the camera's configuration and movements in a logical sequence.\n    *   It is concise while attempting to be informative. The main area for improvement is in the precision of the terminology used.\n\n### Revised and More Accurate Caption\n\nHere is a revised version of the caption that uses more precise terminology:\n\n**From a smooth, eye-level perspective, the camera dollies forward toward a large vault door. As it moves past the doorframe, the camera trucks right to reveal a room beyond. It then continues to dolly forward while pedestaling down slightly. The shot begins with a shallow depth of field focused on the midground door, then executes a rack focus, shifting the focus plane to the background to bring the figures at their computers into sharp view.**",
