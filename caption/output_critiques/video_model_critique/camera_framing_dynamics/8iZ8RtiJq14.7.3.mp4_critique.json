    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** Lacking background information, making it hard to determine the camera height.\n\n**Camera Angle:** Lacking background information, making it hard to determine the camera angle.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses an extremely shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on the caption. It is accurate, concise, and captures the most prominent visual characteristics of the shot. Here is a detailed breakdown of your caption based on the provided instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **\"With an extremely shallow depth of field\"**: Perfectly accurate. The background is completely blurred, isolating the foreground.\n*   **\"the camera moves forward smoothly\"**: Correct. The movement is a steady and smooth dolly-in.\n*   **\"keeping the focus on the marble-patterned surface in the foreground\"**: Accurate. The plane of focus remains on the surface directly in front of the lens as it moves.\n\n**Completeness & Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   The caption successfully identifies the key elements: depth of field, camera movement, and focus plane.\n*   It correctly omits details like video speed and lens distortion, as they are standard.\n*   The description is concise and informative, as requested.\n\n**Areas for Enhancement:**\nWhile the caption is very good, it could be made even more descriptive by including a few more details mentioned in the instructions:\n\n*   **Camera Angle & Height:** The shot is filmed from a very **low, ground-level angle**, which is a significant stylistic choice that adds to the shot's intimate and mysterious feel.\n*   **Movement Terminology:** \"Moves forward\" is perfectly fine, but using the more technical term **\"dollies forward\"** would align more closely with the detailed instruction set.\n*   **Focus Dynamics:** The focus isn't just static on the foreground; it actively shifts forward with the camera's movement to maintain sharpness on the immediate foreground. This could be described as a **slow rack focus** that is synchronized with the dolly movement.\n\n### Revised Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised version that incorporates these additional details for maximum completeness:\n\n**\"From a low, ground-level angle, the camera dollies forward smoothly across a marble-patterned surface. The shot uses an extremely shallow depth of field, with the focus plane shifting forward in sync with the camera's movement to keep the immediate foreground sharp.\"**",
