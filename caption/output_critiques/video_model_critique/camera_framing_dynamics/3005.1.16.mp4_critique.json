    "pre_caption": "The video features a speed ramp effect, smoothly transitioning between fast and slow playback. The camera is positioned at a low angle, looking up. It employs an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the man in the foreground. The camera moves forward while zooming out, maintaining smooth and slow motion throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A video with a speed ramp effect where playback speed smoothly transitions between fast and slow.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses an extremely shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward and zooming out.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on identifying several key cinematic techniques in this short clip. Here is a detailed breakdown of your caption's accuracy and completeness.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n*   **\"The video features a speed ramp effect, smoothly transitioning between fast and slow playback.\"**\n    *   **Accuracy:** This is incorrect. The video plays at a consistent, regular speed. The man's action of looking up is performed at a natural pace without any noticeable acceleration or deceleration characteristic of a speed ramp.\n\n*   **\"The camera is positioned at a low angle, looking up.\"**\n    *   **Accuracy:** Correct. The camera is placed slightly below the subject's eye level, creating a subtle low-angle perspective.\n\n*   **\"It employs an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the man in the foreground.\"**\n    *   **Accuracy:** Correct. The focus is sharply on the man's face, while the background is heavily blurred, indicating a very shallow depth of field.\n\n*   **\"The camera moves forward while zooming out, maintaining smooth and slow motion throughout.\"**\n    *   **Accuracy:** This is an excellent and accurate observation. The technique of dollying in (moving forward) while simultaneously zooming out is known as a \"dolly zoom\" or \"Vertigo effect.\" You have correctly identified the components of this complex camera move. The movement is indeed smooth and slow.\n\n### Summary\n\n**Strengths:**\n*   You correctly identified the low angle.\n*   You accurately described the extremely shallow depth of field.\n*   You astutely recognized the subtle but complex \"dolly zoom\" movement.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n*   The primary error is the misidentification of a speed ramp. The video's speed is constant.\n\n### Revised Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised caption that more accurately reflects the video based on the instructions:\n\n\"This is a low-angle close-up shot of a man's face, filmed with an extremely shallow depth of field that blurs the background. As the man looks up, the camera performs a slow and subtle dolly zoom, moving forward while zooming out, which keeps the subject's size in the frame relatively constant as the background appears to expand.\"",
