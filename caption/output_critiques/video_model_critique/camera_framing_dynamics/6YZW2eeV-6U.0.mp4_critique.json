    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\nThe caption is a good, concise summary of the video's visual characteristics. However, it can be improved in terms of accuracy and completeness by incorporating more specific terminology and details as required by the instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **Accurate:** The descriptions of `eye level`, `level angle`, `deep focus`, `large depth of field`, `moves forward`, and `slightly unsteady with some shaking` are all correct.\n*   **Slightly Inaccurate:** The caption states the camera is \"focusing on the man in the **foreground**.\" While the man is the subject, he is technically in the **midground**. The foreground is the space closest to the camera, which is empty or occupied by the camera operator.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   **Missing - Lens Distortion:** The video clearly shows **barrel distortion** from a wide-angle lens. The straight vertical walls of the corridor appear to curve outwards, especially near the top and bottom edges of the frame. This is a key visual characteristic that should be included.\n*   **Could be more specific - Movement:** The caption says the camera \"moves forward.\" A more precise term from the instructions would be **\"tracking\"** or **\"dollying forward,\"** as the camera is specifically following a subject. \"Tracking\" is the most appropriate term here.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   The caption successfully follows the instruction to be concise and to omit information about normal video speed.\n*   It fails to describe the discernible lens distortion, which is a required element when present.\n*   It uses general terms for movement (\"moves forward\") instead of the more specific technical terms requested (like \"tracking\").\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that more closely adheres to the instructions:\n\n**\"This eye-level, level-angle shot exhibits slight barrel distortion. The camera tracks forward at a walking pace, following a man in a hat and red backpack through a stone corridor. The movement is slightly unsteady, characteristic of a handheld shot, and maintains a deep focus, keeping both the midground subjects and the background walls sharp.\"**\n\n### Why the Revised Caption is Better\n\n*   **Includes Lens Distortion:** It correctly identifies and includes the \"slight barrel distortion.\"\n*   **Uses Precise Terminology:** It uses the term \"tracks forward\" to accurately describe the camera's movement relative to the subject.\n*   **Improves Positional Accuracy:** It correctly identifies the subjects as being in the \"midground.\"\n*   **Adds Context:** It adds useful context by noting the movement is \"characteristic of a handheld shot\" and that the speed is a \"walking pace.\"",
