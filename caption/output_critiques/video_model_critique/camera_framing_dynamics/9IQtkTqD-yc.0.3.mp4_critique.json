    "pre_caption": "This is an unsteady, eye-level shot from a camera moving forward along a dark, wooded road. The camera maintains a level angle and uses a deep focus, keeping the entire scene relatively sharp.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "An evaluation of the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is accurate.\n- The shot is **unsteady**, showing bumps and vibrations consistent with movement on a rough surface.\n- The perspective is **eye-level**, as if from a person's point of view inside a vehicle.\n- The camera is **moving forward** down the road.\n- The camera angle is **level**.\n- The focus is **deep**, as both the road in the foreground and the trees in the background are relatively sharp.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is incomplete. It misses the most defining characteristic of the video's configuration:\n- **Night Vision:** The video is clearly shot through a night vision device, which accounts for the green monochrome image, the high grain/noise, and the bright spot from an infrared illuminator.\n- **Framing:** The distinct circular frame (vignette) is a key visual element resulting from filming through a scope or monocular and is not mentioned.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption adheres to the instructions by describing camera height, angle, movement, and focus. However, it falls short of providing a full description of the \"video’s and camera’s configuration\" by omitting the crucial details about the night vision equipment and its resulting visual effects.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe caption is a good but basic description of the camera's physical movement and settings. Its primary weakness is the failure to describe the specialized equipment (night vision) that defines the entire look and feel of the shot.\n\n**Improved Caption Example:**\n\"Filmed through a night vision device, this unsteady, eye-level shot moves forward along a dark, wooded road. The view is contained within a circular frame, and the camera maintains a level angle with a deep focus that keeps the entire scene relatively sharp.\"",
