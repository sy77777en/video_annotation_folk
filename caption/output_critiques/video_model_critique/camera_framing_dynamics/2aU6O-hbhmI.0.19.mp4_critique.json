    "pre_caption": "The video features noticeable fisheye distortion, causing straight lines to curve outward. The camera is at an aerial level, maintaining a mostly level angle despite intense movements. It uses deep focus with a large depth of field. The drone gradually moves forward with subtle upward and downward motions while panning left to focus on the apartment building. The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features noticable fisheye distortion causing straight lines to curve outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera maintains a mostly level angle, but due to intense camera movements, the exact angle relative to the ground plane is difficult to determine.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The drone gradually moves forward with subtle upward and downward motions while panning left to focus on the apartment building.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on the caption. It correctly identifies several key technical aspects of the shot. Here is a detailed breakdown of its accuracy and completeness based on the instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\n\n*   **Fisheye Distortion:** **Accurate.** The description of \"noticeable fisheye distortion, causing straight lines to curve outward\" is perfect. This is the most prominent visual characteristic of the lens.\n*   **Camera Height:** **Accurate.** \"Aerial level\" is the correct term for a shot taken from this high altitude, likely by a drone.\n*   **Camera Angle:** **Inaccurate.** The caption states the camera maintains a \"mostly level angle.\" However, the shot has a very clear **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon), and this tilt changes as the camera moves. The camera also tilts up towards the building.\n*   **Focus:** **Accurate.** \"Deep focus with a large depth of field\" is a correct assessment. Everything from the building in the midground to the cityscape in the background is sharp.\n*   **Camera Movement:** **Partially Accurate.** \"Gradually moves forward... while panning left\" is a correct description of the component movements. However, it misses the **rolling** motion that causes the Dutch angle to change. The combination of a forward dolly and a pan is more precisely described as an **arc**. The \"subtle upward and downward motions\" is a good observation of the vertical movement (craning/pedestaling).\n*   **Steadiness:** **Accurate.** \"The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking\" is correct, indicating a stabilized platform like a gimbal on a drone.\n\n**Completeness:**\n\n*   The caption successfully covers distortion, height, focus, and steadiness.\n*   It omits two significant details required by the instructions:\n    1.  **Dutch Angle:** The tilted and rotating horizon is a major part of the shot's dynamic feel and should be mentioned.\n    2.  **Rolling Motion:** The camera is not just panning and tilting; it's also rolling on its axis, which is what creates the changing Dutch angle.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   The caption is concise and informative, as requested.\n*   It correctly avoids mentioning standard video speed, as there are no alterations.\n*   It fails to identify and describe the Dutch angle, which is a specific point in the instructions.\n\n### Revised Caption for Improvement\n\nHere is a revised version that incorporates the feedback for greater accuracy and completeness:\n\n**\"This aerial-level shot features extreme fisheye distortion and a prominent, changing Dutch angle. With a deep focus keeping the entire scene sharp, the camera executes a smooth, counter-clockwise arc. This complex movement combines a forward dolly, a left pan, a slight crane up, and a roll, keeping the high-rise building in frame as the sun sets in the background.\"**",
