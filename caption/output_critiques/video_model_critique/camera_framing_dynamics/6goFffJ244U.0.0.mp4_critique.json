    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera focus is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "The provided caption is inaccurate and incomplete.\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption states, \"The video is static,\" which is misleading. While the camera itself is not moving, the primary visual elements—the bokeh particles—are in constant motion, drifting upwards. Describing the entire video as \"static\" ignores the most prominent action within the frame.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption fails to address several key visual characteristics required by the instructions:\n*   **Focus and Depth of Field:** The most significant omission is the description of the focus. The video's entire aesthetic is built on an extremely shallow depth of field, which creates the prominent, out-of-focus bokeh effect. The instructions specifically ask to describe the depth of field and focus plane, and this is a defining feature of the shot.\n*   **Movement of Subjects:** Even if the camera is static, the instructions imply describing the movement of subjects within the frame. The caption should have noted the gentle, upward drift of the golden particles.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption is overly simplistic and does not provide the \"informative description of the video's... configuration\" that was requested. It misses the crucial details about focus and the movement of the elements in the scene.\n\n**Improved Caption:**\nA more accurate and complete caption that adheres to the instructions would be:\n\n\"This is a static shot featuring an extremely shallow depth of field, which renders the entire scene as out-of-focus, golden bokeh particles of various sizes drifting gently upwards against a dark background.\"",
