    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving backward.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is leading the subject from the front.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use “focus on the man in the foreground” rather than “focus on the foreground.” Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase “tracking the subject(s).” Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed evaluation of your caption.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\nThe provided caption is **excellent**. It is accurate, concise, and perfectly adheres to the instructions.\n\n*   **Accuracy:**\n    *   **Camera Height and Angle:** \"camera at eye level with a low angle, looking up at the subjects\" is a precise description. The camera is positioned to look slightly up at the actors, creating the specified low angle from roughly eye level.\n    *   **Focus:** \"employs a shallow depth of field, focusing on the man and woman in the foreground\" is correct. The background elements (trees, distant building) are softly blurred, isolating the subjects.\n    *   **Movement:** \"moves smoothly backward, leading the subjects from the front\" is a perfect description of the camera's motion. This is a classic tracking or dolly shot where the camera retreats at the same pace as the advancing subjects, keeping them framed.\n\n*   **Completeness & Conciseness:**\n    *   The caption correctly identifies all the key dynamic and static elements of the shot: height, angle, focus, and movement.\n    *   It correctly omits details about video speed, lens distortion, and Dutch angle, as they are all standard or absent, which follows the instruction to be concise.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   The caption uses clear and appropriate terminology.\n    *   It successfully describes the camera's configuration and movement without unnecessary jargon or wordiness.\n\nThe caption is a model example of how to apply the given instructions to a video clip.",
