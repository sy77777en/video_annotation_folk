    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera starts at a high angle and smoothly moves forward and down to approach a person looking at a large screen, with an almost negligible pan to the left.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on providing a detailed caption. Here is a breakdown of its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Caption:** \"This high-angle, eye-level shot uses a shallow depth of field to focus on the person in the foreground. The camera moves smoothly forward and down, approaching the person as they stand in front of a large screen.\"\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **\"high-angle, eye-level shot\"**: This is contradictory and inaccurate. A **high-angle shot** is filmed from above the subject, looking down. An **eye-level shot** is filmed from the subject's eye level. This video uses a **high-angle shot** that moves lower but never reaches a true eye-level perspective.\n*   **\"shallow depth of field\"**: This is accurate. The person and the kiosk are in focus, while the background and parts of the foreground are blurred.\n*   **\"focus on the person in the foreground\"**: This is inaccurate. The person is in the **midground**. The patterned floor directly in front of the camera is the foreground.\n*   **\"The camera moves smoothly forward and down\"**: This is an accurate and clear description of the camera's movement.\n\n**Completeness & Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   The caption correctly identifies the camera movement and depth of field.\n*   It attempts to describe the camera angle and height but does so inaccurately.\n*   It correctly omits details like video speed and lens distortion, as they are standard.\n*   The description of the movement is good, covering direction and steadiness (\"smoothly forward and down\").\n\n### Summary\n\nThe caption successfully describes the camera's movement and depth of field but contains significant inaccuracies regarding the camera angle/height and the subject's position within the frame's depth.\n\n### Revised, More Accurate Caption:\n\nHere is a revised version that more accurately reflects the video's configuration:\n\n**This high-angle shot uses a shallow depth of field to keep the person and kiosk in the midground in sharp focus. The camera performs a slow, smooth movement, simultaneously craning down and dollying forward to move closer to the subject.**",
