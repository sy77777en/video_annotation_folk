    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features mild barrel distortion causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is panning left to right.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.",

  "generated_critique": "The provided caption is not good for the video. While it correctly identifies some aspects, it is inaccurate in its most prominent description and lacks the precision required by the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   **Lens Distortion:** The caption describes \"mild barrel distortion.\" This is **highly inaccurate**. The video exhibits very strong **fisheye distortion**, which is a much more extreme form of wide-angle distortion. This is evident in the pronounced curvature of the horizon, the road, and the severe bending of the traffic light pole on the left side of the frame.\n*   **Camera Position:** \"Positioned at eye level with a level angle, looking straight ahead\" is partially correct. The height and angle are reasonable descriptions. However, the camera is not statically \"looking straight ahead\"; its primary action is a rotational movement.\n*   **Focus:** \"Deep focus with a large depth of field\" is **accurate**. Everything from the foreground crosswalk to the background buildings is in sharp focus.\n*   **Movement:** \"Pans from left to right with slight unsteadiness, exhibiting some shaking\" is **accurate**. The camera does perform an unsteady pan to the right.\n\n### Completeness & Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   The caption fails to accurately describe the **degree** of lens distortion, which is a key instruction. It misidentifies strong fisheye distortion as mild barrel distortion.\n*   The description of movement could be better integrated. The instructions ask to describe movements in temporal order. Stating the camera is \"looking straight ahead\" and then that it \"pans\" is less effective than describing the action as it happens (e.g., \"The camera starts by looking forward-left and then pans unsteadily to the right...\").\n*   The caption correctly omits details about video speed, as it is at a normal playback rate.\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is a more accurate caption that adheres to the instructions:\n\n\"This real-time, point-of-view shot features extreme **fisheye distortion**, causing a curved horizon and bending vertical lines at the frame's edges. The camera is positioned at approximately eye-level with a level angle. The shot uses **deep focus**, keeping the entire scene sharp. From a relatively fixed position, the camera performs an unsteady **pan from left to right** to survey the intersection.\"",
