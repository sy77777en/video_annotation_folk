    "pre_caption": "The video features a camera at eye level with a level angle, using a shallow depth of field focused on the foreground. The camera moves forward with noticeable shaking, indicating unsteady motion.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "An evaluation of the caption is provided below.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **\"camera at eye level with a level angle\"**: This is accurate. The camera is positioned at the subject's eye level and is not tilted up or down.\n*   **\"using a shallow depth of field focused on the foreground\"**: This is correct. The subject in the foreground is in focus, while the background (the door and wall) is softly blurred.\n*   **\"The camera moves forward with noticeable shaking, indicating unsteady motion\"**: This part is partially accurate but could be more precise. The camera does have an unsteady, handheld quality, but \"noticeable shaking\" might be an overstatement. The movement is more of a very subtle, slow drift forward combined with a gentle, organic wobble, rather than overt shaking. \"Unsteady motion\" is a correct conclusion, but the description of how it gets there could be refined.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully covers the key visual elements: camera height, angle, focus, and movement.\n*   It correctly omits standard aspects like normal video speed and the absence of lens distortion, adhering to the instruction for conciseness.\n\n**Adherence to Instruction:**\n*   The caption follows the instructions well by providing a concise description of the camera's configuration and movement.\n*   It correctly identifies and describes the relevant parameters like angle, height, focus, and steadiness.\n\n**Overall Feedback:**\nThe caption is good and captures the main characteristics of the shot. It is mostly accurate and complete. The only point of improvement would be to describe the camera's movement with more nuance. Instead of \"moves forward with noticeable shaking,\" a more precise description would be \"drifts slowly forward with a subtle, organic wobble, indicating an unsteady handheld shot.\" However, the current caption is still effective and largely correct.",
