    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a ground level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is panning right.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is panning rightward to track the subject.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\nThe caption is a decent starting point but contains several inaccuracies regarding the camera's height, movement quality, and the subject's action.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n\n*   **Partially Accurate:** \"The camera is positioned at ground level with a low angle, looking up.\"\n    *   The **low angle** is correct.\n    *   **\"Ground level\"** is an exaggeration. The camera is low, positioned below the level of the mattress, but it's not on the floor. \"Low height\" would be more accurate.\n*   **Accurate:** \"It uses deep focus with a large depth of field.\" The child in the midground and the wall art in the background are both relatively sharp.\n*   **Inaccurate:** \"The camera smoothly pans right to follow the child in the red hat as they move across the room.\"\n    *   The movement is **not smooth**; there is a noticeable organic wobble, characteristic of a **handheld** shot.\n    *   The child is not moving \"across the room\"; they are thrashing and jumping in a relatively fixed position on the bed.\n    *   The movement is more of a reactive **tracking adjustment** than a deliberate pan.\n\n**Completeness:**\n\n*   The caption correctly identifies the angle, focus, and the basic purpose of the movement.\n*   It fails to mention the key characteristic of the shot's feel: its **handheld, unsteady nature**.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   The caption attempts to cover the required points (height, angle, focus, movement).\n*   However, by mischaracterizing the movement as \"smooth\" and the subject's action as moving \"across the room,\" it fails to provide a precise and informative description.\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a more accurate caption that adheres to the instructions:\n\n**\"Shot from a low height with a low angle, this handheld clip has a slightly unsteady feel. The camera makes a minor tracking adjustment, panning and trucking slightly to the right to keep the agitated child in the midground in focus. The shot maintains a relatively deep focus, keeping both the child and the background decor sharp.\"**",
