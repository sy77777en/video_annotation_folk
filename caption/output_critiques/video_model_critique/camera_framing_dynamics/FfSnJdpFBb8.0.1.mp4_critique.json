    "pre_caption": "Starting at hip level from a high angle, the camera looks down at a patch of grass and flowers on the floor of a crowded subway car. It then smoothly and rapidly dollies backward while simultaneously moving down to ground level and tilting up, transitioning to a low-angle view of the passengers.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees) and then moves to a ground level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a high angle (looking down from above) and then changes to a low angle (looking up from below) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves slightly downward and tilts up while rapidly moving backward inside a crowded train.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on the caption. It accurately identifies the core camera movements and framing changes. Here is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the starting position (hip-level, high angle), the subject (grass on a subway floor), and the complex camera movement (dolly backward, moving down, tilting up) that results in a low-angle shot.\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is good but incomplete. It successfully describes the physical camera movement but omits the most prominent visual effect: the strong radial blur/zoom effect that occurs during the rapid dolly-out. This streaking effect is a crucial part of the shot's configuration and visual style, and its absence is a significant omission. The description of \"deep focus\" is reasonable, but this is heavily obscured by the motion effect.\n*   **Adherence to Instruction:** The caption adheres well to the instructions regarding conciseness, structure, and terminology (dolly, tilt, angle). However, by not mentioning the significant blur/distortion effect, it falls short of providing a complete description of the \"video's and camera's configuration.\"\n\n### Suggested Improvement\n\nHere is a revised version that incorporates the missing visual effect for a more complete description:\n\n**Revised Caption:**\nStarting at a hip-level high angle, the camera looks down at a patch of grass and flowers on the floor of a crowded subway car. It then executes a rapid dolly-out, simultaneously craning down to ground level and tilting up to a low-angle view of the passengers. This backward movement is accompanied by a strong radial blur and zoom effect, causing the scene to streak outwards from the center. The shot maintains a deep focus, though the motion effect blurs the image significantly during the transition.",
