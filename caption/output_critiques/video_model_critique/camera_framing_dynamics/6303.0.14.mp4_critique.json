    "pre_caption": "The camera is positioned at eye level and uses a high angle, looking down. It employs a shallow depth of field, focusing on the man in the midground. The camera tilts up with some shaking, then moves forward to track the man as he moves backward while facing the camera. The movement is slightly unsteady.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera tilts up with some shaking, then moves forward to track a person moving backward while facing the camera.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is following the subject from behind.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption has some accurate observations but also contains significant inaccuracies and omissions that misrepresent the shot's configuration.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of your caption:\n\n**Critique of the Caption:**\n\n*   **\"The camera is positioned at eye level...\"**: **Accurate.** The camera is at the same height as the subject's eyes.\n*   **\"...and uses a high angle, looking down.\"**: **Inaccurate.** This is the most significant error. The camera is at a **level angle**, pointing straight at the subject's face. A high angle would mean the camera is positioned above the subject and tilted downward, creating a sense of vulnerability or smallness, which is not what is happening here. The shot is confrontational and direct.\n*   **\"It employs a shallow depth of field, focusing on the man in the midground.\"**: **Accurate.** The man is in focus, while the background and the hands in the extreme foreground are out of focus.\n*   **\"The camera tilts up with some shaking, then moves forward to track the man...\"**: **Partially Accurate but Misleading.** While there is shaking, the primary movement is not a distinct tilt or a formal track. The most important context, which you've missed, is that this is a **first-person point-of-view (POV) shot**. The unsteady, organic movement (slight bobbing and a subtle push forward) is characteristic of a person holding the camera, not a formal camera operation like a \"track.\"\n*   **\"The movement is slightly unsteady.\"**: **Accurate.** This is a key feature of the handheld, POV style.\n\n**Completeness and Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Missing Key Information:**\n    1.  **Shot Type:** You failed to identify this as a **first-person point-of-view (POV)** shot, which is the single most important descriptor. It explains the hands in the foreground, the unsteady movement, and the immersive perspective.\n    2.  **Lens Distortion:** The shot clearly uses a wide-angle lens, creating noticeable **barrel distortion**. This is evident in how the hands in the foreground appear large and stretched, and the straight lines of the checkerboard pattern curve near the edges of the frame.\n\n**Revised and Improved Caption:**\n\nHere is a more accurate and complete caption that adheres to the instructions:\n\n\"This first-person point-of-view (POV) shot is filmed at a level angle and eye-level height, with noticeable wide-angle lens distortion. A shallow depth of field keeps the man in the midground in focus. The handheld camera is unsteady, making slight, organic forward and bobbing movements that simulate a person's natural motion.\"",
