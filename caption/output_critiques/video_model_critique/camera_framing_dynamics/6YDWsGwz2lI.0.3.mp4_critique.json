    "pre_caption": "The video is in slow motion, with the camera positioned at eye level and angled low, looking up at the buildings. It uses deep focus, maintaining clarity across the scene. The camera moves forward slowly and smoothly, capturing the upward view of the skyscrapers without any shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A slow-motion video where playback speed is reduced, making actions appear slower than real-time.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on the caption. It is clear, concise, and accurately identifies most of the key technical aspects of the shot according to the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **\"The video is in slow motion\"**: **Accurate.** The smooth, gliding motion and the majestic feel strongly suggest the use of slow motion.\n*   **\"with the camera positioned at eye level\"**: **Slightly Inaccurate.** To achieve such a steep upward angle while still seeing the base of the adjacent buildings, the camera is likely positioned lower than eye level, probably at **hip-level or lower**.\n*   **\"and angled low, looking up at the buildings\"**: **Accurate.** This is a perfect description of a low-angle shot.\n*   **\"It uses deep focus, maintaining clarity across the scene\"**: **Accurate.** The foreground building walls, the midground skyscrapers, and the distant Willis Tower are all in sharp focus.\n*   **\"The camera moves forward slowly and smoothly... without any shaking\"**: **Accurate.** The movement is a very steady and slow forward dolly.\n\n**Completeness & Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   The caption successfully covers video speed, camera angle, focus, and camera movement (type, speed, and steadiness) as requested.\n*   It correctly omits details about lens distortion and Dutch angles, as they are not present, adhering to the conciseness rule.\n*   The description is informative without being overly wordy.\n\n### Suggested Improvement\n\nThe only significant point of improvement is the camera height. By correcting this and using slightly more technical language, the caption can be made even more precise.\n\n**Revised Caption Example:**\n\n\"Filmed in slow motion from a low height, the shot uses a pronounced low angle to look up at the skyscrapers. With deep focus keeping the entire scene sharp, the camera dollies forward slowly and smoothly through the urban canyon.\"",
