    "pre_caption": "The video features an aerial-level camera at a high angle, looking down from above. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera smoothly trucks left while panning right to keep the building centered in the frame, concluding with a quick zoom in to emphasize the building.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera trucks left while panning right to focus the building at the center of the frame throughout the video, ending with a quick zoom in to highlight it.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on creating a caption that covers many of the required elements. Here is a detailed breakdown of your caption's accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **Partially Accurate:** The description of the camera movement as \"trucks left while panning right\" captures the general direction but oversimplifies the motion. The camera follows a curved path, not a straight line. A more accurate description would be **arcing counter-clockwise** or **craning down and arcing**. This curved movement is what creates the dynamic, three-dimensional reveal of the building complex.\n*   **Inaccurate:** The statement that the video concludes with a \"quick zoom in\" is incorrect. The camera moves continuously closer to the subject throughout the shot (a dolly-in motion), but there is no separate or distinct zoom action at the end.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   **Missing Key Element:** The caption completely omits the most prominent visual effect: the **time-lapse** lighting. The video clearly shows a rapid transition from darkness to full daylight, simulating a sunrise in a matter of seconds. This is a crucial aspect of the video's aesthetic and should be mentioned first.\n*   **Lacks Detail on Movement:** The description of the movement could be more specific. The shot begins very close to a polygonal dome structure before pulling back and beginning its main arcing motion. Mentioning this starting point would add valuable context.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   You successfully identified and described the **camera height (aerial-level)**, **angle (high angle)**, and **focus (deep focus)**.\n*   You attempted to describe the camera movement and its purpose, which aligns with the instructions.\n*   However, by missing the altered **video speed (time-lapse)** and providing a partially inaccurate description of the camera's path, the caption does not fully meet the requirements for a comprehensive and precise description.\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a more accurate and complete caption that adheres to all the instructions:\n\n**This time-lapse video shows a digital rendering of a city block, transitioning rapidly from night to day. The shot uses an aerial, high-angle perspective with deep focus, keeping the entire model sharp. The camera begins close to a dome, then pulls back and executes a smooth, continuous movement, craning down and arcing counter-clockwise to reveal the central building complex.**",
