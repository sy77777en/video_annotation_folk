    "pre_caption": "The video features a high-angle camera at eye level, focusing on a man in the midground with a shallow depth of field. The camera smoothly moves forward, following the man from behind.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is following the subject from behind.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "The provided caption is not good for the video. It contains significant inaccuracies and omits crucial information.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n### Accuracy:\n*   **Incorrect Camera Movement:** The caption states the camera \"moves forward, following the man from behind.\" This is incorrect on both counts. The camera is in **front** of the man and is moving **backward** (a dolly-out or tracking-out motion) to maintain distance as the man approaches.\n*   **Confusing Angle/Height Description:** The phrase \"high-angle camera at eye level\" is contradictory. While the camera is at the operator's eye level (making it a POV shot), it is positioned above the subject's head, creating a high angle. A better description would clarify this relationship.\n\n### Completeness:\n*   **Missing POV Framing:** The most defining characteristic of this shot is that it's a **first-person point-of-view (POV)**. The hands holding a comb and scissors in the foreground are essential context that the caption completely ignores.\n*   **Missing Lens Distortion:** The shot is filmed with a wide-angle lens, which creates noticeable **barrel distortion**. This is evident in the slight curvature of the checkered lines on the floor and walls.\n*   **Incomplete Focus Description:** While it correctly identifies a shallow depth of field, it fails to mention the out-of-focus hands in the extreme foreground, which are a key part of the POV framing.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions:\nThe caption fails to provide a \"concise yet informative description\" because its core claims about camera movement and position are wrong. It also misses key visual elements like the POV perspective and lens distortion, which are required by the instructions.\n\n### A better caption would be:\n\n\"This is a first-person point-of-view (POV) shot from eye level, looking down at a man in a high angle. The camera uses a wide-angle lens, creating slight barrel distortion. With a shallow depth of field, the focus is kept on the man in the midground, while the operator's hands in the foreground and the room's background are soft. The camera smoothly dollies backward as the man walks toward it.\"",
