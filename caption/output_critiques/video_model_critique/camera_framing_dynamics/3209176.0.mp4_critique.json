    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A slow-motion video where playback speed is reduced, making actions appear slower than real-time.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving backward.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is leading the subject from the front.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on the caption. It is accurate, comprehensive, and adheres perfectly to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of your caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate.\n    *   **Video Speed:** \"slow motion\" is correct. The man's movements are deliberately slowed.\n    *   **Camera Configuration:** \"at eye level and angled low, looking up\" is a precise description of the camera's position and perspective, which creates a powerful and imposing view of the subject.\n    *   **Focus:** \"shallow depth of field, focusing on the man in the foreground\" is spot on. The background is blurred, effectively isolating the subject.\n    *   **Movement:** \"moves smoothly and slowly backward, leading the man from the front\" perfectly captures the camera's motion. This is a classic tracking or dolly shot, and your description of its steadiness, speed, and purpose is excellent.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is very complete. It successfully covers all the key elements requested in the instructions:\n    *   **Video Speed:** Included.\n    *   **Camera Angle & Height:** Included.\n    *   **Focus & Depth of Field:** Included.\n    *   **Camera Movement (Type, Steadiness, Speed, Purpose):** All included.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** You followed the instructions perfectly. The description is concise while remaining rich in detail. You correctly omitted information about non-existent features like lens distortion or shot transitions, keeping the caption focused and efficient.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is outstanding. It provides a clear, professional, and technically sound description of the video clip, demonstrating a strong understanding of cinematography principles and the specific requirements of the task. No improvements are needed.",
