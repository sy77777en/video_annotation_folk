    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is moving left to right.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions.\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\nThe caption is a good starting point but has a major inaccuracy and lacks the specific terminology requested in the instructions.\n\n**Accuracy: Poor**\n\n*   **Major Inaccuracy:** The most significant error is that the caption describes camera movement (\"moves smoothly from left to right\") for what is a **static image** (a single frame from a video). As provided, there is no movement, speed, or change over time.\n*   **Accurate Elements:** The descriptions of the camera's configuration are otherwise correct. It is indeed an **aerial view** from a **high angle**, and it does have a **deep focus**, with the entire scene appearing sharp.\n\n**Completeness: Incomplete**\n\n*   The caption covers the basic aspects like angle, height, and focus.\n*   However, it fails to use the specific terminology for camera movement as required by the instructions. Instead of \"moves... from left to right,\" a more precise term like **trucking right** (linear sideways movement) or **arcing clockwise** (circling the subject) should have been used. For a drone shot like this, **arcing** is the more probable movement to keep the subject centered.\n*   It correctly omits details about video speed and lens distortion, as neither is present or abnormal.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions: Fair**\n\n*   The caption attempts to be concise and informative, which aligns with the instructions.\n*   It correctly identifies and describes the camera angle, height, and focus.\n*   It fails to adhere to the instruction to describe the **type** of movement with specific terms (e.g., trucking, arcing, panning).\n*   Crucially, it fails to accurately describe the provided media, inventing movement where there is none.\n\n### Corrected and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a caption that would be accurate for the provided **static image**:\n\n\"This is a **static, aerial, high-angle shot** of a church and its surrounding graveyard. The camera has a **deep focus**, rendering the entire landscape in sharp detail.\"\n\nIf we assume the image is a frame from a video that does move as described, a better caption following the instructions would be:\n\n\"This **aerial, high-angle shot** maintains a **deep focus**. The camera performs a smooth and steady **arc clockwise** around the church, providing a sweeping view of the building and its graveyard.\"",
