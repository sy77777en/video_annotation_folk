    "pre_caption": "From a high, aerial perspective with a varying Dutch angle, the camera tracks a car drifting in the snow. The drone glides right and forward while tilting down, then smoothly arcs clockwise in a descent. During this motion, the camera gradually tilts upward, transitioning from a high angle to a level, eye-level view as it approaches the car, which grows larger in the frame. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire snowy landscape sharp.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts at an aerial level and then moves to an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a high angle (looking down from above) and then changes to a level angle (looking straight ahead) due to camera motion. The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The drone tracks the car from a high-angle aerial view, gliding right while moving forward and tilting downward. It then arcs clockwise in a smooth descent, gradually tilting upward to reach a level angle as it approaches the car.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tracking the subject from an aerial view while moving in an arc. During the tracking shot, the subject becomes larger in the frame.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on this caption. It is highly detailed, accurate in most aspects, and adheres very well to the provided instructions. However, there is one significant inaccuracy and a minor point of confusion that could be improved.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **Mostly Accurate:** The description of the perspective (high, aerial), angle change (high to level), focus (deep), and the overall purpose (tracking) is spot on.\n*   **Inaccuracy:** The caption states the drone is \"**tilting down**,\" which is incorrect. To keep the car in the frame as the drone descends and moves closer, the camera must **tilt up**. The caption contradicts itself by later correctly stating, \"the camera gradually tilts upward.\" The initial movement is a complex arc forward and down, but the camera head itself is tilting up relative to the drone's body.\n*   **Minor Confusion:** The phrase \"**then** smoothly arcs\" suggests the movements are sequential. In reality, the forward motion, descent, and clockwise arc are all part of one continuous, complex maneuver.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   **Excellent:** The caption is very thorough. It correctly identifies and describes the camera height, angle, multiple complex movements (tracking, arcing, craning/descent), focus, and even subtle details like the varying Dutch angle.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Excellent:** The caption successfully covers all the required points from the instructions in a concise manner, avoiding unnecessary information like video speed or lens distortion, which are standard in this clip.\n\n### Suggested Improvement\n\nHere is a revised version of the caption that corrects the inaccuracy and clarifies the camera movement:\n\n**Revised Caption:**\nFrom a high, aerial perspective with a varying Dutch angle, the camera tracks a car drifting in the snow. The drone executes a smooth, complex movement, arcing clockwise while descending and moving forward. During this maneuver, the camera simultaneously tilts upward to keep the car centered, transitioning the view from a high angle to a more level, eye-level perspective as it closes in. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire snowy landscape sharp.",
