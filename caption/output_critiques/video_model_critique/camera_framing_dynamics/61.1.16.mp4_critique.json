    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a static camera at eye level, using a high angle to look down on two women in a diner booth. The camera then moves forward, approaching the woman with green hair. The movement is unsteady, with noticeable shaking. The camera maintains deep focus, keeping all elements sharp.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera remains static at first, then moves forward to approach the woman with green hair.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good. It contains several inaccuracies and omits key details required by the instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption:\n\n*   **Accuracy:**\n    *   **\"The video begins with a static camera...\"**: This is incorrect. The camera is moving forward and slightly downward from the very beginning of the clip.\n    *   **\"...at eye level...\"**: This is incorrect. The camera is positioned at a high angle, looking down on the subjects, which is much higher than a typical eye-level shot.\n    *   **\"...approaching the woman with green hair.\"**: This is incorrect. The camera is approaching the woman in the middle booth who is wearing a green *beret*. The woman in the background booth has blonde/light brown hair.\n    *   **\"...deep focus, keeping all elements sharp.\"**: This is an overstatement. While the depth of field is not shallow, the woman in the background booth is noticeably softer in focus than the two women in the foreground and midground. A more accurate description would be a moderate depth of field.\n\n*   **Completeness:**\n    *   The caption fails to mention the significant **wide-angle lens distortion**, which is visible in the curvature of the booths and the floor tiles.\n    *   It misses the most important contextual element: this is a **first-person perspective (POV)** shot, evidenced by the unsteady, forward-moving nature and the hand that enters the frame from the bottom left.\n    *   The description of the movement as just \"moves forward\" is vague. A more precise term like \"dolly-in\" or \"tracking forward\" would be better.\n\n### A More Accurate Caption:\n\nThis first-person perspective shot, filmed with a wide-angle lens that creates noticeable barrel distortion, begins from a high angle. The unsteady, handheld camera dollies forward and slightly down, moving through a diner toward a woman in a booth. The focus remains on the midground subjects with a moderate depth of field.",
