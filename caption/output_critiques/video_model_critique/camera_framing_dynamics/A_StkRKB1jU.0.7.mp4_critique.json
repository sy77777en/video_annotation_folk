    "pre_caption": "An eye-level, handheld camera is initially stationary, with a shallow depth of field focused on the midground. As three masked intruders enter the building, the camera begins a smooth pan to the left to track them.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The handheld camera remains stationary, showing three masked intruders entering a building. As they pass through the door, the camera begins panning left to track them.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is panning leftward to track the subject.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "The provided caption is not good for the video. It is both inaccurate and incomplete, failing to capture the dynamic nature of the camera work and missing a key transition.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the issues:\n\n*   **Accuracy of Movement:** The caption describes the movement as a \"smooth pan.\" This is incorrect. The camera work is clearly **handheld**, characterized by its shaky, energetic, and reactive quality. This is a deliberate stylistic choice to create a sense of urgency and realism, which the word \"smooth\" completely misrepresents.\n*   **Completeness (Shot Transition):** The caption completely ignores the **hard cut** that occurs at the 00:01 mark. The instructions explicitly require describing shot transitions and the camera work in each segment.\n*   **Completeness (Second Shot):** Following the cut, the camera movement changes entirely. It is no longer panning from a relatively fixed position but is now executing a **forward tracking shot**, moving along with the subjects from behind as they run down the hall. The caption fails to mention this second, distinct phase of movement.\n*   **Accuracy of Initial State:** The caption states the camera is \"initially stationary.\" While it's not moving far, it has the distinct, subtle wobble of a handheld camera waiting to react, so \"stationary\" is an oversimplification.\n\nA more accurate and complete caption, following the provided instructions, would be:\n\n**Segment 1 (00:00-00:01):** An eye-level, handheld shot with a shallow depth of field focuses on the midground. The camera pans left with a slight shake, tracking two masked figures as they run into the building.\n\n**Segment 2 (00:01-00:04):** After a hard cut, the camera is now behind the figures, executing a shaky, handheld forward tracking shot that follows them as they run down a hallway.",
