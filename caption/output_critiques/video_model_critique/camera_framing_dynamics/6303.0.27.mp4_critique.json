    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a ground level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on providing a concise description. Here is a detailed breakdown of your caption's accuracy and completeness based on the instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\n\n*   **\"The camera is positioned at ground level...\"**: **Accurate.** The camera is placed very low on the court surface.\n*   **\"...with a level angle...\"**: **Inaccurate.** The camera is tilted slightly upward to capture the basketball hoop and the sky. This is a **low-angle shot**, not a level one.\n*   **\"...focusing on a basketball in the midground.\"**: **Inaccurate.** The basketball is the closest object to the camera and is the primary subject of focus. It is in the **foreground**. The players are in the midground.\n*   **\"It employs a shallow depth of field, keeping the basketball sharp while the background is blurred.\"**: **Accurate.** The focus is clearly on the ball, with the rest of the scene being out of focus.\n*   **\"The camera remains completely static, with no movement or shaking.\"**: **Accurate.** The shot is completely still.\n\n**Completeness:**\n\n*   The caption correctly identifies the static nature of the shot, the camera height, and the shallow depth of field.\n*   It misses identifying the **low angle**.\n*   It fails to mention the use of a **wide-angle lens**, which is evident from the way the foreground is slightly stretched and the expansive view of the court.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption adheres well to the instruction for conciseness and covers most of the required elements. However, the inaccuracies in describing the camera angle and focus plane are significant.\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a more accurate version of the caption:\n\n**A static, ground-level, low-angle shot focuses on a basketball in the foreground. The shot utilizes a wide-angle lens and a shallow depth of field, keeping the ball in sharp focus while the players in the midground and the surrounding court are blurred.**",
