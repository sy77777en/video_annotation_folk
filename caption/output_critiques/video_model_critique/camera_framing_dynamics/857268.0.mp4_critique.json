    "pre_caption": "The video features an aerial-level camera at a high angle, using deep focus with a large depth of field.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The drone steadily moves forward, tracking the couple from an aerial view, then slightly descends at the end.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tracking the subject from above and behind.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on this caption. It is highly accurate, comprehensive, and adheres closely to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of your caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **Excellent:** The caption is almost perfectly accurate.\n    *   \"Aerial-level camera at a high angle\" correctly identifies the camera's position and perspective.\n    *   \"Deep focus with a large depth of field\" is a precise description of the focus, as the entire scene from the couple to the distant water is sharp.\n    *   \"Smoothly moves forward, tracking a couple\" perfectly describes the camera's primary movement and its purpose.\n    *   \"From above and behind\" accurately specifies the camera's position relative to the subjects.\n    *   \"The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking\" correctly notes the stability of the shot, likely achieved with a drone and gimbal.\n*   **Minor Point:** The claim that the camera \"slightly descends at the end\" is very subtle and difficult to confirm. The change in perspective could also be interpreted as a slight tilt down. However, this is a minor observation, and its inclusion does not detract from the overall quality of the caption.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   **Excellent:** The caption successfully covers all the relevant aspects required by the instructions.\n    *   **Camera Configuration:** Angle, height, and focus are all described.\n    *   **Camera Movement:** The type (tracking, forward movement), steadiness (smooth), and purpose (following the couple) are all clearly stated.\n    *   **Omissions:** You correctly omitted mentions of video speed, lens distortion, and Dutch angle, as they are all standard/absent in the video, which aligns perfectly with the instruction to be concise.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Perfect:** You followed the instructions exceptionally well. The caption is a model example of what was requested. It is concise while being packed with relevant, technical information. The language is clear, and the description of the camera's action in relation to the subjects is very effective.\n\n### Final Assessment\n\nThe caption is excellent. It is a professional and accurate description of the video's technical and stylistic elements, demonstrating a strong understanding of cinematography and the specific requirements of the prompt.",
