    "pre_caption": "The video begins with the camera at eye level, looking straight ahead. It uses deep focus, keeping all elements sharp. Initially static, the camera briefly zooms in while panning right to focus on the woman in the gold dress. It then remains static with slight shaking, maintaining smooth movement throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera starts off static, briefly zooms in while panning right, and then remains to a static position with slight shaking.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good for this video. It contains significant inaccuracies regarding the focus and camera movement.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n*   **Accuracy:**\n    *   **Focus:** The caption incorrectly states the video uses \"deep focus, keeping all elements sharp.\" This is the most significant error. The video clearly uses a **shallow depth of field**, as the background (the crowd, lights, and tent structure) is noticeably blurred, which serves to isolate the two women in the foreground.\n    *   **Movement & Steadiness:** The caption's description of movement is contradictory and inaccurate. It claims the camera is \"initially static\" and later \"remains static with slight shaking.\" A shot cannot be both static and shaking. The camera is **handheld** throughout the entire clip, resulting in a constant, slight unsteadiness. It is never truly static.\n    *   The phrase \"maintaining smooth movement\" is also misleading. While not excessively jerky, the movement has the characteristic micro-jitters of a handheld shot, which is not typically described as \"smooth\" in the way a gimbal or dolly shot would be.\n\n*   **Completeness:**\n    *   The caption correctly identifies the **eye-level** perspective and the **pan right** and **zoom in**.\n    *   However, it fails to mention the slight **tilting** movements the camera operator makes to keep the subjects framed as they move.\n    *   It completely misidentifies the depth of field, a key stylistic choice in this type of interview shot.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   The caption attempts to follow the instructions by addressing camera height, movement, and focus.\n    *   However, by providing incorrect information on several key points, it fails to be an informative or accurate description.\n\nA more accurate caption would be:\n\n**This is a handheld, eye-level shot with a shallow depth of field, keeping the two women in the foreground in focus while blurring the busy background. The camera is unsteady, exhibiting a constant slight shake. It performs minor reframing movements, including a slight zoom-in and a pan to the right, to keep the woman in the gold dress centered as she speaks and gestures.**",
