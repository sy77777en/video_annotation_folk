    "pre_caption": "The video features noticeable fisheye distortion, causing straight lines to curve outward. The camera is at an aerial level, with the angle mostly level but occasionally tilting slightly upward for a low-angle perspective. It maintains deep focus with a large depth of field. The drone primarily flies forward, smoothly, with brief, random clockwise and counterclockwise rolls, as if testing motion controls.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features noticable fisheye distortion causing straight lines to curve outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle changes throughout the video but is mostly level, occasionally tilting slightly upward to create a low-angle perspective.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The drone primarily flies forward, occasionally performing brief, random clockwise and counterclockwise rolls, as if someone is testing its motion controls.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on the caption. It correctly identifies several key technical aspects of the shot. Here is a detailed breakdown of its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy: Good**\n\n*   **Correct:** The identification of **fisheye distortion**, the **aerial level**, **deep focus/large depth of field**, and the **smooth forward movement** are all accurate.\n*   **Partially Correct/Needs Refinement:**\n    *   **Camera Angle:** The description \"mostly level but occasionally tilting slightly upward\" is not quite right. The camera is in a continuous state of **tilting up** to keep the massive building in frame as it flies closer and higher. The shot is almost entirely a **low-angle** perspective.\n    *   **Camera Movement:** The description of \"brief, random clockwise and counterclockwise rolls, as if testing motion controls\" misinterprets the motion. The roll is not random; it's a smooth, continuous part of the overall arcing/craning movement. This roll is what creates the **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon), which shifts dynamically throughout the shot. The purpose is stylistic, not a test.\n\n**Completeness: Fair**\n\n*   **What's Missing:**\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The instructions specify mentioning a Dutch angle if present. The \"rolls\" you noted create a significant and shifting Dutch angle, which is a primary characteristic of the shot and should be explicitly named.\n    *   **Primary Vertical Movement:** The caption mentions the camera \"flies forward\" but omits the equally important vertical movement. The camera is **craning up** (moving vertically upward) as it flies forward, ascending the face of the building.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions: Good**\n\n*   The caption successfully follows the instruction to be concise and to omit standard attributes like normal video speed.\n*   However, it falls short in accurately describing the complexity and purpose of the camera movement, as the interpretation of the \"rolls\" was subjective and incorrect.\n\n### Revised Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised caption that incorporates the feedback and more accurately describes the scene according to the instructions:\n\n\"Shot with a fisheye lens from an aerial perspective, this video features a dynamic Dutch angle and deep focus. The camera executes a smooth, continuous motion, craning upward and moving forward from a low angle to fly up the face of the building, while simultaneously rolling slightly to enhance the arcing effect.\"",
