    "pre_caption": "The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, capturing the scene with deep focus and a large depth of field. It moves quickly from left to right, smoothly panning in the middle to shift focus from the car behind to the one in front. The movement is very smooth, with no shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves from left to right, with a pan from left to right in the middle to switch focus from the car behind to the one in front.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving quickly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent attempt. The caption correctly identifies several key aspects of the camera's configuration and movement. However, there are a few inaccuracies and areas for improvement in terms of technical precision.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n*   **\"The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, capturing the scene with deep focus and a large depth of field.\"**\n    *   **Accuracy:** This part is entirely accurate. The camera height, angle, and deep depth of field are all correctly described.\n\n*   **\"It moves quickly from left to right...\"**\n    *   **Accuracy:** Correct. The primary direction of movement is accurately stated.\n\n*   **\"...smoothly panning in the middle to shift focus from the car behind to the one in front.\"**\n    *   **Accuracy:** This section contains two key inaccuracies.\n        1.  **Movement Type:** The camera movement is a **tracking** or **trucking** shot (moving parallel to the subject), not a **pan** (rotating on a fixed axis). The camera itself is translating through space alongside the cars.\n        2.  **Subject Order:** The camera starts by following the car in the **front** (the limousine) and then moves to reveal the car **behind** it (the SUV). The caption incorrectly reverses this order.\n\n*   **\"The movement is very smooth, with no shaking.\"**\n    *   **Accuracy:** This is a perfect observation. The smoothness is a notable characteristic, likely because this is a computer-generated animation with a virtual camera.\n\n### Summary of Evaluation\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption covers most of the required elements: height, angle, focus, movement direction, and steadiness.\n*   **Accuracy:** While mostly accurate, the description of the specific camera movement (\"panning\") and the order of the subjects is incorrect, which is a significant error.\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows the structure and intent of the instructions well but falters on the precise technical terminology for camera movement.\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is an example of a more accurate and technically precise caption:\n\n\"This continuous shot is captured from an eye-level, level-angle perspective with a deep depth of field, keeping all elements in sharp focus. The camera performs a smooth, fast-paced **tracking shot**, moving from left to right. It initially follows the lead limousine before accelerating to overtake it, revealing the trailing SUV.\"",
