    "pre_caption": "The video features a ground-level camera at a level angle, focusing on a woman doing push-ups with a shallow depth of field, emphasizing the foreground. The camera smoothly trucks right to follow her movements and slightly pans left at the end, maintaining minimal shaking throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a ground level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera smoothly trucks right to show a woman doing push-ups and slightly pans left at the end.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is highly accurate, comprehensive, and adheres strictly to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its quality:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is exceptionally accurate.\n    *   **Camera Height & Angle:** \"Ground-level camera at a level angle\" is a perfect description. The camera is positioned very low to the floor and is not tilted up or down.\n    *   **Focus:** \"Shallow depth of field\" is correct, as the background is visibly blurred, drawing attention to the subject. \"Emphasizing the foreground\" is also accurate, as the woman occupies the foreground and is the clear focal point.\n    *   **Camera Movement:** The description of the movement is precise. The primary motion is a \"trucks right to follow her movements,\" and the subtle \"slightly pans left at the end\" is a keen observation that correctly identifies the minor adjustment to keep the subject framed.\n    *   **Steadiness:** \"Maintaining minimal shaking\" accurately reflects the smooth, stable quality of the shot.\n\n*   **Completeness & Conciseness:** The caption strikes an excellent balance.\n    *   It includes all the necessary dynamic elements: camera height, angle, focus, and movement (type, direction, purpose, and steadiness).\n    *   Following the instructions, it correctly omits static or standard attributes like regular video speed and the absence of lens distortion, which keeps the description concise and focused on what is actively happening.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption perfectly follows the guidelines.\n    *   It provides a concise yet informative description of the camera's configuration and movement.\n    *   It uses the correct terminology (trucks, pans, shallow depth of field).\n    *   It describes the movements in their temporal order.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is excellent. It demonstrates a strong understanding of cinematography terms and a careful observation of the video. There are no necessary corrections or significant improvements to be made.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "Shot from a stable, ground-level camera at a level angle, the video uses a shallow depth of field to focus on the subject. The camera smoothly trucks right, following the woman's push-up motion, and concludes with a slight pan left to keep her framed.",
