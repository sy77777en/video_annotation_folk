    "pre_caption": "The video begins with the camera at eye level, focusing on a woman in the foreground with a shallow depth of field. The camera is slightly unsteady but remains fixed. As the scene progresses, the camera lowers to hip level, maintaining focus on the woman.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts at an eye level (above the waist) and then moves to a hip level (below the waist and above the knees).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent attempt. The caption correctly identifies several key aspects of the shot, but it mischaracterizes the camera's movement.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of your caption:\n\n**Critique:**\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is partially inaccurate. It correctly notes the initial eye-level height, the focus on the woman, the shallow depth of field, and the slight unsteadiness. However, the statement that the camera \"remains fixed\" is incorrect. The camera performs a distinct downward movement to follow the subject.\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is incomplete because it fails to accurately describe the primary camera action. While it mentions the camera \"lowers to hip level,\" it doesn't specify *how* it does this. According to the instructions, the type of movement (e.g., tilting, pedestaling) is a crucial detail.\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption does not fully adhere to the instructions by mislabeling the camera's movement. The instructions specifically ask to identify movements like \"tilting,\" which is the correct term for the action in the video.\n\n**Corrections and Suggestions:**\n\n*   The camera is not \"fixed\"; it performs a **downward tilt**.\n*   This tilt is a **tracking** movement, as it follows the subject's action.\n*   The description \"lowers to hip level\" describes the resulting frame, but the camera's action is a **tilt**, not a pedestal (moving the entire camera unit down).\n\n**A More Accurate Caption:**\n\nThis eye-level, single shot begins with a shallow depth of field, focusing on a woman in the midground. The slightly unsteady, handheld camera then **tilts down**, tracking the woman as she moves out of the frame.",
