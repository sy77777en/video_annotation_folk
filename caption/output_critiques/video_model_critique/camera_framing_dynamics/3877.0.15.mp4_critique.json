    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving backward and moving down.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on this caption. It is accurate, concise, and adheres well to the instructions. Here is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n*   **Accuracy:**\n    *   **Camera Configuration:** Your description of an \"aerial-level camera at a level angle\" is spot on. The shot is taken from the air, and the horizon is kept level.\n    *   **Focus:** \"Deep focus with a large depth of field\" is perfectly correct. The foreground cliff, the climbers, and the distant mountains are all in sharp focus.\n    *   **Movement:** \"Smoothly moves backward and downward\" is an accurate description of the camera's motion. It's a slow, steady pull-back and descent, likely from a drone or helicopter.\n\n*   **Completeness:**\n    *   The caption successfully covers all the key aspects of the shot as requested: height, angle, focus, and movement.\n    *   The only minor point of incompleteness is in describing the subject. The shot features **several climbers** on the cliff, not just \"a climber.\"\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   The caption is concise and avoids unnecessary details, just as the instructions requested.\n    *   It correctly identifies and describes the relevant technical elements without mentioning the aspects that are standard (e.g., regular speed, no distortion).\n\n### Suggested Improvement\n\nTo make the caption perfect, you could make one small change to more accurately reflect the content of the scene:\n\n**Original Caption:** The video features an aerial-level camera at a level angle, employing deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera smoothly moves backward and downward, capturing a climber on a rocky cliff.\n\n**Revised Caption:** The video features an aerial-level camera at a level angle, employing deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera smoothly moves backward and downward, capturing **several climbers** on a rocky cliff.\n\nThis change from \"a climber\" to \"several climbers\" makes the description of the scene's content more precise. Otherwise, your analysis of the camera work is excellent.",
