    "pre_caption": "The video is shot at eye level with a level angle, focusing on a server in a restaurant. It uses a shallow depth of field, concentrating on the server in the foreground. The camera smoothly follows the server from behind in a third-person over-the-hip POV as they deliver water to a table. The server becomes smaller in the frame as the camera moves forward, ending with a slight pan to the left when the water is placed on the table.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The video captures a third-person over-the-hip POV in a restaurant, following a server delivering water to a table of guests. The camera moves forward, tail-tracking the server, and ends with a slight pan to the left as they place the water on the table.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is following the subject from behind. During the tracking shot, the subject becomes smaller in the frame.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good for this video. While it correctly identifies some basic camera settings, it contains significant inaccuracies regarding the on-screen action and the camera's relationship to the subject.\n\n### Feedback:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is inaccurate in several key areas.\n    *   **Incorrect Action:** The caption states the server is delivering water to a table. In the video, the person is simply walking through the restaurant; they do not stop or interact with a table to deliver anything.\n    *   **Incorrect Camera-Subject Relationship:** The caption claims, \"The server becomes smaller in the frame as the camera moves forward.\" This is incorrect. The camera is performing a **tracking shot**, moving forward *with* the subject and maintaining a relatively constant distance. Therefore, the server's size in the frame remains consistent throughout the shot. The server would only become smaller if the camera were static while they walked away from it.\n    *   **Incorrect Justification for Movement:** The \"slight pan to the left\" is not tied to the action of placing water on a table, as that action never occurs.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption correctly identifies the camera height, angle, shallow depth of field, and the general idea of a smooth follow shot. However, it fails to use more precise terminology like \"tracking shot\" or \"dolly forward,\" which would better describe the movement.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption attempts to follow the instructions but fails on the fundamental requirement of accurately describing what is happening in the video. The misinterpretation of the camera movement and the subject's action makes the description misleading.\n\n### Corrected Caption Example:\n\nHere is a more accurate caption that adheres to the instructions:\n\n**A steady, eye-level tracking shot follows a person from behind as they walk through a busy restaurant. The camera maintains a consistent distance, keeping the subject centered in a medium shot. A shallow depth of field isolates the person from the blurred background patrons and decor, creating an immersive, third-person perspective on their movement through the space.**",
