    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good for this video. Here is a detailed breakdown of its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **\"forward-moving camera at eye level, maintaining a level angle\"**: This is perfectly accurate. The shot is from the perspective of a vehicle moving forward, which places the camera at roughly the eye level of a seated person, and the horizon is kept level.\n*   **\"It employs deep focus with a large depth of field, capturing the street scene clearly\"**: This is also correct. Both the nearby dashboard reflection and the distant taillights are in focus, indicating a large depth of field.\n*   **\"The camera movement is slightly unsteady, with some shaking\"**: This accurately describes the minor vibrations and bumps characteristic of a camera mounted in a moving car.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully covers the key aspects requested: camera movement (forward-moving), height (eye level), angle (level), focus (deep focus), and steadiness (slightly unsteady).\n*   It correctly omits details that are not present, such as altered video speed, lens distortion, or complex movements (panning, tilting, zooming), which aligns with the instruction to be concise and only mention relevant features.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   The caption is **concise yet informative**, as requested. It avoids jargon where simpler terms suffice (e.g., \"forward-moving\" instead of \"dollying in\").\n*   It follows the negative constraints perfectly by not mentioning that the video is at regular speed or that there is no lens distortion.\n*   It provides a clear and easy-to-understand description of the camera's configuration and movement without being overly technical or verbose.\n\nIn summary, the caption is excellent. It is a precise, complete, and well-written description that perfectly follows the provided guidelines.",
