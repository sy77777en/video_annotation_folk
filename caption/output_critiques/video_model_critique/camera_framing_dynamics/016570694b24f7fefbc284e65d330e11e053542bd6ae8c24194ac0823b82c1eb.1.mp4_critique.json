    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a high angle (looking down from above) and then changes to a level angle (looking straight ahead) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The video features a cup of coffee, employing ultra-shallow focus and focus tracking. As the camera moves closer, the cup of coffee always remains relatively sharp. However, in the end, when the camera slightly pulls away, the entire image becomes out of focus.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera, positioned at a high angle, moves forward and downward to approach the coffee cup while tilting up to level its angle. The footage is also somewhat shaky as if someone shoots it using a handheld camera.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on this caption. It is accurate, detailed, and adheres well to the provided instructions. Here is a breakdown of its strengths and some minor suggestions for even greater precision.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Caption:** The video begins with a high-angle view, looking down at a cup of coffee. The camera moves forward and downward, tilting up to achieve a level angle as it approaches the cup. The focus is ultra-shallow, with focus tracking keeping the coffee cup sharp. The camera is slightly shaky, suggesting handheld shooting. At the end, as the camera pulls away, the entire image becomes out of focus.\n\n---\n\n**Accuracy and Completeness:**\n\n*   **Camera Angle & Movement:** Your description of the camera starting at a high angle and moving forward while tilting up to a level angle is very accurate. This captures the complex, subtle movement effectively.\n*   **Focus:** The identification of an \"ultra-shallow\" depth of field is perfect. The background is completely blurred, isolating the subject. \"Focus tracking\" is also the correct term for how the cup remains sharp during the camera's forward movement.\n*   **Steadiness:** Noting the \"slightly shaky\" movement and correctly inferring \"handheld shooting\" is a great observation that adds valuable context.\n*   **Ending:** The description of the image becoming out of focus at the end is correct.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   The caption is concise while providing all the necessary information about the camera's configuration and movement.\n*   It correctly omits standard elements like regular video speed and the absence of lens distortion, as per the instructions.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\nWhile the caption is very good, it could be made slightly more technically precise with minor wording changes:\n\n1.  The movement \"forward\" is technically a **dolly in**. Using this term can add a professional touch.\n2.  The movement \"downward\" is very subtle; the primary motion is the dolly in. The downward shift in framing is more a result of getting closer to the subject from a high angle.\n3.  The description of the end \"as the camera pulls away\" is not quite accurate. The camera doesn't clearly pull away; it seems to jolt slightly as the focus is lost. The most significant action is the focus change itself.\n\n### Revised Caption for Comparison\n\nHere is a revised version incorporating these minor suggestions to demonstrate the increase in technical precision:\n\n**Revised Caption:** The video, shot with an ultra-shallow depth of field, opens on a slight high-angle of a coffee glass. The slightly shaky, handheld camera dollies in, tilting up to transition to a level angle. Focus tracking keeps the glass sharp during the movement, which concludes as the image is pulled completely out of focus.",
