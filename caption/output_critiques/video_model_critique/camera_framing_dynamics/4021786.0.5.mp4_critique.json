    "pre_caption": "This slightly unsteady, handheld shot begins at eye level with a low angle, looking up at a kite in the sky.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a low angle (looking up from below) and then changes to a high angle (looking down from above) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The handheld camera tilts downward and pans from right to left, shifting the focus from the sky to a little girl playing with a kite.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on the caption. It is concise, well-structured, and accurately captures most of the key technical aspects of the shot. Here is a detailed breakdown of your caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate in its description of the camera's configuration and movement. It correctly identifies the shot as handheld and unsteady, the initial low angle, the subsequent tilt and pan, the resulting high angle, and the deep focus.\n*   **Completeness:** The description is very complete according to the instructions. It covers steadiness, height, angle, movement (type and direction), and focus. It correctly omits details like video speed and lens distortion, as they are standard.\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows the instructions perfectly by providing a concise yet informative technical summary.\n\n### Point for Improvement\n\nThere is one minor point of inaccuracy that could be refined:\n\n*   The phrase \"**shifting the focus to** a little girl\" is slightly misleading. In cinematography, \"shifting focus\" (or rack focus) refers to an optical change where the plane of sharp focus moves from one subject to another at a different distance. In this video, the camera maintains a **deep focus** throughout, meaning everything from the foreground to the background is kept relatively sharp. The camera's *framing* and *attention* shift to the girl, but the optical focus itself does not appear to change.\n\n### Suggested Revision\n\nHere is a revised version that addresses this nuance for greater technical accuracy:\n\n**Revised Caption:** This slightly unsteady, handheld shot begins at eye level with a low angle, looking up at a kite in the sky. The camera then tilts downward and pans from right to left **to frame** a little girl on the road. This movement changes the perspective to a high angle looking down at the girl. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp.\n\nBy replacing \"shifting the focus to\" with \"to frame,\" the description more accurately reflects that the change is in composition, not in the optical focal plane, which aligns perfectly with the final observation about the deep focus.",
