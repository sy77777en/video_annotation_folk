    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is following the subject from behind. During the tracking shot, the subject becomes smaller in the frame.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on providing a detailed caption. Here is a breakdown of its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Caption:** \"The video features a camera at eye level, maintaining a level angle with deep focus and a large depth of field. The camera moves slowly forward, following a person from behind, who gradually becomes smaller in the frame. The movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.\"\n\n---\n\n**Accuracy:**\n\n*   **Partially Accurate:** The description of the camera at **eye level** and maintaining a **level angle** is correct. The description of the **slow forward movement** and the **unsteady, shaking** quality is also accurate, capturing the handheld feel of the shot.\n*   **Inaccurate:**\n    *   The caption states the shot has **\"deep focus and a large depth of field.\"** This is incorrect. The shot has a **shallow depth of field**. The subject (the person's back and backpack) is in focus, but the trees in the background and the reeds in the immediate foreground are soft and blurry.\n    *   The caption claims the person **\"gradually becomes smaller in the frame.\"** This is also incorrect. The camera is tracking the person, moving forward at the same pace, which keeps the person at a relatively consistent size within the frame. If the person were getting smaller, it would mean the camera was static while the subject moved away from it.\n\n**Completeness:**\n\n*   The caption successfully covers camera height, angle, movement, and steadiness.\n*   It omits a very prominent visual element: the **anamorphic lens flare** (the horizontal rainbow-colored streak) across the frame.\n*   It misidentifies the focus, but it does attempt to describe it. A more complete description would specify that the focus is on the **midground subject**.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   The caption follows the instructions to be concise and to describe the key camera parameters.\n*   It correctly omits details about video speed and lens distortion, as they appear to be normal and absent, respectively.\n*   However, the inaccuracies in describing the depth of field and the subject's framing detract from its overall quality.\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a more accurate and complete caption that adheres to the instructions:\n\n**\"This is a slow, handheld-style tracking shot from an eye-level, level angle, following a person from behind through a field of tall grass. The camera maintains a consistent distance from the subject, who remains in the midground. The shot has a shallow depth of field, keeping the person in focus while the background trees are soft and blurry. A prominent horizontal lens flare is visible across the center of the frame.\"**",
