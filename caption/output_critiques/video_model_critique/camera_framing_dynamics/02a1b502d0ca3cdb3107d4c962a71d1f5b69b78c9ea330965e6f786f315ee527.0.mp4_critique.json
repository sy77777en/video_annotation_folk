    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A slow-motion video where playback speed is reduced, making actions appear slower than real-time.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good. It provides an accurate, complete, and concise description that adheres to all the given instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is effective:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   **Video Speed:** The caption correctly identifies the video is in **slow motion**. This is evident from the smooth, drawn-out movement of the right hand and the way the cards seem to float into place.\n*   **Camera Configuration:** The description of the camera being at **eye level** and at a **high angle** is accurate. This perspective mimics a first-person point of view, looking down at one's own hands.\n*   **Focus:** The caption accurately notes the **shallow depth of field**, with the focus correctly identified on the **cards in the foreground** (the hand being held), while the cards on the table in the background are blurred.\n*   **Camera Movement:** The description of the camera as **fixed but slightly unsteady** is precise. There is no deliberate panning, tilting, or tracking, but there is a minor, natural wobble characteristic of a handheld or body-mounted camera, which the caption captures well.\n\n### Completeness\n*   The caption covers all the relevant aspects mentioned in the instructions: video speed, camera angle, camera height, focus/depth of field, and camera movement/steadiness.\n*   It correctly omits details that are not present, such as lens distortion or a Dutch angle, which aligns with the instruction to be concise.\n*   Since there are no shot transitions, it correctly describes the video as a single, continuous shot.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is brief and to the point, avoiding unnecessary words while still being highly informative.\n*   **Terminology:** It uses the correct technical terms as requested (e.g., \"slow motion,\" \"high angle,\" \"shallow depth of field,\" \"foreground,\" \"fixed\").\n*   **Structure:** The information is presented logically, starting with the video's speed and then moving to the camera's setup and behavior.\n\nIn summary, the caption is an excellent example of what was requested. It is a well-written, technically accurate, and complete description of the video's visual characteristics.",
