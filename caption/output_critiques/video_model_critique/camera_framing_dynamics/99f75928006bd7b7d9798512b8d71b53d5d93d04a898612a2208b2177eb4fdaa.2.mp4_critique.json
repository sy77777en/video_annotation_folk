    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is panning left to right.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is a good attempt but contains some inaccuracies regarding the camera's angle and movement.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Caption Feedback\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is mostly accurate but could be more precise.\n    *   **\"low, eye-level angle\"**: This phrasing is slightly confusing. \"Eye-level\" is correct, as the camera is positioned at the same height as the subjects' eyes. However, \"low angle\" typically implies the camera is tilted *upwards* at the subject. In this shot, the camera has a **level angle** (it is parallel to the ground and not tilted). A more precise description would be \"an eye-level, level angle.\"\n    *   **\"shallow depth of field to blur the kitchen background\"**: This is perfectly accurate. The focus is on the women in the foreground, and the background is softly blurred.\n    *   **\"minor pan from left to right\"**: This is incorrect. A **pan** is a rotational movement on a fixed axis. In the video, the entire camera moves horizontally to the right, which is a **truck** or **dolly** movement. You can tell because the perspective between the subjects and the background shifts, which wouldn't happen with a simple pan. The movement is indeed very smooth and minor.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is very complete. It correctly identifies the key visual elements (subjects, action, focus, movement) and adheres to the instruction to be concise by omitting details about non-existent features like lens distortion or speed changes.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows the instructions well by describing the camera's configuration, movement, and focus. The only area for improvement is the technical precision of the terms used for angle and movement.\n\n### Improved Caption\n\nHere is a more accurate version of the caption:\n\n\"Filmed from an eye-level, level angle, the camera focuses on two women in the foreground eating pizza, utilizing a shallow depth of field to blur the kitchen background. The camera performs a very smooth and subtle truck to the right.\"",
