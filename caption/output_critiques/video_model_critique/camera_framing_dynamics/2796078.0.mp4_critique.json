    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving left.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is moving leftward to track the subject from the side.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on the caption. It is concise and accurately captures the key aspects of the shot while adhering to the instructions. Here is a detailed breakdown of its accuracy and completeness.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **\"The camera is at eye level and maintains a level angle\"**: Correct. The camera is positioned at the subject's height and is not tilted up or down.\n*   **\"focusing on the woman holding a dog in the foreground\"**: Mostly correct. The focus is indeed on the woman and dog. However, for technical precision, they occupy the **midground**. The \"foreground\" is the space between the camera and the subjects. While \"foreground\" is often used colloquially for the main subject, \"midground\" is more accurate in this context.\n*   **\"with a shallow depth of field\"**: Correct. The background is clearly out of focus, isolating the subjects.\n*   **\"It moves leftward to side track the woman\"**: Correct. The camera moves laterally to follow the subject's movement.\n*   **\"with slight shakiness in the movement\"**: Correct. The movement has a subtle, handheld quality, indicating it's not on a perfectly smooth dolly or gimbal.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully identifies the most important camera attributes: height, angle, focus, depth of field, and the primary movement.\n*   It correctly omits non-existent features like lens distortion or speed changes, as per the instructions.\n*   To be even more descriptive, the caption could elaborate on the complexity of the camera's movement. In addition to tracking left, the camera also performs a slight **counter-clockwise arc**, moving from a position more directly behind the woman to one more at her side. It also **pans left** slightly to keep her centered.\n\n### Suggested Improvement\n\nFor a more comprehensive and precise description, you could refine the caption as follows:\n\n**Revised Caption:**\n\"The camera is at eye level and maintains a level angle, focusing on the woman and dog in the **midground** with a shallow depth of field. It tracks the subjects as they walk left, performing a slight **counter-clockwise arc** with minor handheld shakiness.\"\n\nThis revision improves accuracy by changing \"foreground\" to \"midground\" and adds completeness by describing the arcing nature of the tracking shot, which better captures the camera's path relative to the subject.",
