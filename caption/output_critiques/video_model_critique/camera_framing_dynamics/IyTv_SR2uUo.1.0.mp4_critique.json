    "pre_caption": "This video is characterized by a speed ramp effect, shifting between fast and slow motion, and noticeable fisheye distortion. The slightly unsteady camera is positioned at a high, eye-level angle with a rolling Dutch angle.\n\nUsing a deep focus, the camera lead-tracks the motorcycle rider, moving backward. As the rider launches into the air for a stunt, the camera moves upward and rolls to follow his acrobatics, then moves downward to track his landing.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A speed ramp effect where playback speed shifts between fast and slow.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features noticable fisheye distortion causing straight lines to curve outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above). The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves backward, lead-tracking the motorcycle rider. As he launches off a ramp for an aerial stunt, it moves upward and rolls to keep focus on his acrobatics. It then moves downward to follow him as he lands back on the ground.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is leading the subject from the front.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains several inaccuracies regarding the camera's configuration and movement. The lens distortion is significant fisheye distortion, not \"subtle barrel distortion.\" The camera is positioned at a low angle, looking up at the rider from the front of the motorcycle, not at a \"high, eye-level angle.\" The description of the camera movement is incorrect; it does not \"lead-track\" the rider or move \"backward.\" Instead, the camera is mounted to the front of the motorcycle, creating a point-of-view shot from the vehicle's perspective. Its movement (moving upward, rolling, and moving downward) is a direct result of being attached to the motorcycle as it performs the jump, not an independent tracking motion. The caption should be revised to state that it is a low-angle, motorcycle-mounted POV shot with significant fisheye distortion, and that the camera's movement mirrors the bike's trajectory.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This point-of-view shot is captured from a camera mounted low on the front of a motorcycle, looking up at the rider. The shot is characterized by significant fisheye distortion and a speed ramp effect that alternates between fast and slow motion. The camera's movement is not independent; instead, it directly follows the motorcycle's trajectory. As the bike launches into the air for a jump, the camera moves upward and rolls with the vehicle before moving downward for the landing. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the rider and the surrounding dirt track in view.",
