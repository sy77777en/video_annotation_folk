    "pre_caption": "The video features a drone camera at an overhead level, capturing a racing car from a high angle. The camera maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field. It moves forward and downward, tracking the car from above and behind, with smooth rolling motions to enhance the dynamic feel. The camera angle includes a varying Dutch angle due to rolling, and the car becomes larger in the frame as it is tracked. The movement is smooth with minimal shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an overhead level (around second floor height).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above). The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The drone moves forward and downward at an aerial level to track a racing car from behind, incorporating rolling motions to enhance the dynamic feel.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tracking the subject from above and behind. During the tracking shot, the subject becomes larger in the frame.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent attempt. The caption correctly identifies several key cinematic techniques, but there are a few significant inaccuracies regarding focus and movement.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of your caption:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\n\n*   **\"The video features a drone camera at an overhead level, capturing a racing car from a high angle.\"**\n    *   **Mostly Accurate:** \"Drone camera\" is a correct and logical inference. \"High angle\" is also correct. However, \"overhead level\" is slightly imprecise; **\"aerial-level\"** is the more appropriate term from the instructions, as the camera is high in the air, not directly above the subject in a top-down view.\n\n*   **\"The camera maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field.\"**\n    *   **Inaccurate:** This is the main point of error. The extreme blurriness of the background is not due to a shallow depth of field but is **motion blur** caused by the high-speed tracking of the car. In a deep focus shot, both the foreground and background would be sharp. Here, only the subject (the car) is relatively in focus, while everything else is streaked horizontally due to the camera's rapid movement. The focus is on the midground, but the defining visual characteristic is motion blur, not depth of field.\n\n*   **\"It moves forward and downward, tracking the car from above and behind, with smooth rolling motions to enhance the dynamic feel.\"**\n    *   **Highly Accurate:** This is an excellent description. The camera is indeed tracking the car forward, and the \"smooth rolling motions\" are a key element of the shot, correctly identified as a way to \"enhance the dynamic feel.\" The slight downward movement is also plausible as it follows the car around the bend.\n\n*   **\"The camera angle includes a varying Dutch angle due to rolling, and the car becomes larger in the frame as it is tracked.\"**\n    *   **Partially Accurate:** The first part, \"a varying Dutch angle due to rolling,\" is a perfect observation and correctly links the roll to the tilted horizon. However, the second part, \"the car becomes larger in the frame,\" is **inaccurate**. The camera maintains a relatively consistent distance from the car, so its size in the frame does not noticeably change.\n\n*   **\"The movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\"**\n    *   **Accurate:** The shot is very stable, which is characteristic of a professional drone with a gimbal.\n\n**Completeness & Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   The caption successfully covers most of the required elements: camera height, angle, movement (tracking, rolling), and steadiness.\n*   It correctly identifies the purpose of the movement.\n*   It correctly omits non-existent features like slow-motion or significant lens distortion.\n*   The main deviation from the instructions is the misinterpretation of motion blur as a depth-of-field effect.\n\n### Revised, More Accurate Caption:\n\nHere is a revised version that corrects the inaccuracies:\n\n**An aerial-level, high-angle shot tracks a drifting car from behind. The focus is held on the car in the midground, while the surroundings are rendered as extreme motion blur due to the camera's high-speed forward movement. The camera performs a smooth, continuous roll as it follows the car around a bend, creating a dynamic, varying Dutch angle. The shot is very steady, and the camera maintains a consistent distance from the car.**",
