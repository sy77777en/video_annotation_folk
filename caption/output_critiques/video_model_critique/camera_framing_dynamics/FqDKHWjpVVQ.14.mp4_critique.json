    "pre_caption": "The video is shot from an eye-level, level angle. It depicts a first-person shooter game where the player's camera first trucks right, then quickly zooms in to shoot an enemy, with some panning for aiming. The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking. The camera uses deep focus, keeping a large depth of field sharp.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** An FPS shooting game where the player first trucks right, followed by a quick zoom-in to shoot the enemy, with some panning for aiming.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good because it is inaccurate and incomplete, failing to adhere to key parts of the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the issues:\n\n*   **Incompleteness (Shot Transition):** The most significant error is the failure to mention the **hard cut** that occurs at 00:01. The instructions explicitly state: \"When shot transitions occur, describe the camera framing and movement in each segment separately, note the type of transition...and explain how the framing and movement change between segments.\" The caption incorrectly describes the action as a continuous sequence (\"first trucks right, then quickly zooms in\"), when in reality, these are two separate shots.\n\n*   **Inaccuracy (Focus):** The caption claims the camera uses \"deep focus, keeping a large depth of field sharp.\" This is only true for the first shot (00:00). In the second shot (00:01 onwards), the player is aiming down the sights (ADS), which in most modern games, including this one, creates a **shallow depth of field** to help the player focus on the target. The background becomes noticeably blurred. The caption fails to describe this change in focus between the two shots.\n\n*   **Inaccuracy (Movement Description):** While it correctly identifies trucking, zooming, and panning, the description is oversimplified. The \"zoom\" is a specific in-game mechanic (aiming down sights) that also changes the depth of field. The \"panning for aiming\" in the second shot is much more erratic and shaky than the subtle panning in the first, a distinction the caption misses.\n\n*   **Lack of Structure:** By ignoring the hard cut, the caption loses the structure required by the instructions. A proper description would analyze the two distinct shots separately.\n\n**A better caption that follows the instructions would be:**\n\n\"The video, from a first-person shooter game, consists of two shots separated by a hard cut.\n\n1.  **Shot 1 (00:00):** From an eye-level, level angle, the camera trucks right with unsteady, naturalistic shaking. The focus is deep, keeping the entire environment sharp.\n2.  **Shot 2 (00:01):** The camera is now zoomed in (simulating aiming down sights), which creates a shallow depth of field that blurs the background. It pans erratically to track enemies, with severe shaking caused by weapon recoil.\"",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This first-person shooter gameplay video consists of two shots separated by a hard cut.\n\nThe first shot (00:00), filmed from an eye-level, level angle, features an unsteady camera that trucks right. It uses a deep focus, keeping the entire environment sharp.\n\nFollowing a hard cut, the second shot (00:01) is zoomed in, simulating the player aiming down the weapon's sights. This creates a shallow depth of field that blurs the background. The camera pans erratically to track a target, with significant shaking caused by weapon recoil.",
