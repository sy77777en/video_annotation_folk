    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera focus is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera tracks the avatar from a side view, trucking slightly to the right before smoothly transitioning to the left. As the avatar accelerates, the trucking matches its speed.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tracking the subject from the side.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption accurately describes the basic camera movement as smooth tracking from a side-view perspective. However, it is missing several key details required by the instructions. Most importantly, it completely omits the time-reversal effect that occurs when the character falls, a crucial aspect of the video's speed. The caption also fails to describe the focus, which, in this 2D game, keeps all elements in sharp focus without a realistic depth of field. Finally, the description of the movement could be more precise by connecting the camera's trucking motions to the specific actions of the avatar on screen, including during the time-reversal sequence.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a side-view perspective, the camera keeps all visual elements in sharp focus, from the foreground avatar to the stylized background, consistent with a 2D game aesthetic. The camera smoothly tracks the avatar, first trucking right as the character runs along a platform. When the character falls, a time-reversal effect is initiated, rewinding the action at high speed to place the character back on the platform; the camera precisely follows this reversed movement. The camera then seamlessly transitions to trucking left as the character changes direction and runs the other way, maintaining a consistent and smooth tracking speed throughout the sequence.",
