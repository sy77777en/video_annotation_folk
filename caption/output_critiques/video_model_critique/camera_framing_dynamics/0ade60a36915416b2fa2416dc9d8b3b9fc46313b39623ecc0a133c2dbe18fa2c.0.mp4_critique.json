    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera, set in outer space, approaches a planet initially covered in dirt, transforming into an Earth-like appearance. Meanwhile, the starry background rotates, and the Earth rotates around its y-axis.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Your analysis of the caption is flawed. Here's a detailed breakdown of its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\nThe caption provides a decent general summary of the video's content but fails to meet the specific technical requirements outlined in the instructions.\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is mostly accurate in its description of the events. However, it incorrectly identifies the planet as \"Earth\" when it is clearly Mars undergoing a terraforming process. The description of the background \"rotating\" is also imprecise; the background shifts due to the camera's own movement (parallax), not independent rotation.\n\n*   **Completeness & Adherence to Instructions:** The caption is incomplete and does not adhere well to the detailed instructions.\n    *   **Video Speed:** **Major Omission.** The most prominent visual effect is the transformation of the planet, which is a **time-lapse**. The instructions explicitly require identifying this, and the caption fails to do so.\n    *   **Camera Movement:** The description is too vague. While \"smoothly approaches\" and \"slow and steady\" are correct, the instructions ask for specific movement types. The camera is performing a slow **arc** or **dolly-in**, which should be specified.\n    *   **Camera Angle/Height:** The caption omits any description of the camera's angle or height (e.g., **high angle**, **aerial-level**), which is a required element.\n    *   **Focus:** The description of \"deep focus\" is correct and well-stated.\n    *   **Object Movement:** The caption correctly notes the planet's rotation but misses the movement of the small moon/asteroid, which moves out of the frame to the left.\n\n### Corrected Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised caption that better follows the provided instructions:\n\n\"This is a single, continuous shot featuring a **time-lapse** of the planet Mars being terraformed. The camera is positioned at an **aerial-level** with a **high angle** view. The shot maintains a **deep focus**, keeping the foreground moon, the midground planet, and the background stars in sharp focus throughout. The camera executes a slow, steady **arc** toward the planet, causing it to grow larger in the frame while the planet itself rotates on its axis.\"",
