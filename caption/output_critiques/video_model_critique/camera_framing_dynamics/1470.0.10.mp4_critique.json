    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves forward while panning left to track a person in white from behind.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is following the subject from behind.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent analysis. Here is a detailed breakdown of the caption's quality based on your instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\nThe provided caption is good and accurately captures the main characteristics of the shot. However, it could be slightly more precise in its description of the camera movement.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **\"The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle...\"**: This is accurate. The camera follows the subject from a height that corresponds to their head/shoulders, which is effectively eye-level, and the horizon is not tilted.\n*   **\"...focusing on a person in white with a shallow depth of field.\"**: This is correct. The subject in the white shirt is in sharp focus, while the background is clearly blurred, indicating a shallow depth of field.\n*   **\"It moves forward smoothly... ensuring minimal shaking.\"**: This is accurate. The movement is very steady, suggesting the use of a gimbal or Steadicam.\n*   **\"...while panning left to track the person from behind...\"**: This is partially accurate but could be more specific. The primary camera movement is a **dolly forward** or a **tracking shot**, as the entire camera setup moves through space to follow the subject. The pan to the left is a secondary, corrective movement that occurs as the subject moves into the next area of the room. Describing the entire movement as \"panning left to track\" is a slight oversimplification.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully covers the key required elements: camera height, angle, focus/depth of field, and movement (translation, steadiness, and purpose).\n*   It correctly omits details that are not present, such as altered video speed or lens distortion, adhering to the instruction for conciseness.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   The caption is concise and informative.\n*   It follows the structure of describing the camera's configuration and movement.\n\n### Suggested Improvement\n\nFor greater technical precision, the description of the movement could be refined.\n\n**Revised Caption Example:**\n\"This eye-level, level-angle shot tracks a person from behind with a shallow depth of field. The camera dollies forward smoothly at a walking pace, panning slightly to the left to follow the subject's path through the interior space.\"\n\n**Why it's an improvement:**\n*   It uses the more specific term **\"dollies forward\"** or **\"tracks\"** to describe the primary physical movement of the camera.\n*   It clarifies that the **\"panning\"** is a secondary adjustment to follow the subject's path, rather than the main method of tracking.",
