    "pre_caption": "This very smooth tracking shot follows a skier from the side, exhibiting mild barrel distortion. The camera moves in a continuous counter-clockwise arc, causing the skier to grow larger in the frame. Starting at an eye-level, level angle, the camera rolls counter-clockwise, which creates a varying Dutch angle. As the skier launches off the jump, the camera tilts up, shifting to a low angle to capture the action from below. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the skier and the snowy mountain background sharp.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features mild barrel distortion causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a level angle (looking straight ahead) and then changes to a low angle (looking up from below) due to camera motion. The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves in a continuous counter-clockwise arc, rolling counter-clockwise during the first half of the shot, then tilting up in the second half.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tracking the subject from the side while moving in an arc. During the tracking shot, the subject becomes larger in the frame.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly identifies the lens distortion as \"mild barrel distortion.\" The video clearly shows significant fisheye distortion, evident in the extreme curvature of the horizon and the landscape at the edges of the frame. Additionally, the description of the camera movement could be more integrated. The caption correctly identifies a \"tracking shot\" and a \"counter-clockwise arc,\" but presents them as separate ideas. A more precise description would combine these movements. Finally, the statement that the camera \"rolls counter-clockwise, which creates a varying Dutch angle\" is slightly misleading; a Dutch angle is present from the start, and it varies as a result of the camera's complex arcing and tilting motion rather than being created by a simple roll.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This dynamic tracking shot, captured with a fisheye lens evident in the curved horizon, follows a skier approaching a jump. The camera moves in a continuous counter-clockwise arc, starting at an eye-level Dutch angle and causing the skier to grow larger in the frame. As the skier launches, the camera's arcing path naturally tilts it upward, shifting to a dramatic low angle to capture the aerial maneuver from below. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping both the skier and the vast, snowy mountain background in sharp detail throughout the action.",
