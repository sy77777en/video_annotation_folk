    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a high-angle view, looking down at the horses. The camera is at eye level and transitions to a level angle, focusing on the horse in the foreground with a shallow depth of field. The camera is quite unsteady, moving without a clear pattern.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a high angle (looking down from above) and then changes to a level angle (looking straight ahead) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is quite unsteady, but its motion lacks a clear pattern.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "The provided caption is not good for the video. It contains significant inaccuracies regarding the camera's angle and movement.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n*   **Accuracy:**\n    *   **\"The video begins with a high-angle view, looking down at the horses.\"** This is incorrect. The camera is positioned at a **level angle**, roughly parallel to the ground and the horses. It is not looking down from a significant height.\n    *   **\"...and transitions to a level angle...\"** This is also incorrect. Since the shot starts with a level angle, there is no transition. The angle remains consistent throughout the clip.\n    *   **\"The camera is quite unsteady, moving without a clear pattern.\"** This is an exaggeration. The camera is **mostly static**. There is a very slight, almost imperceptible handheld wobble and a slow, subtle drift to the right, but it is not \"quite unsteady\" or moving erratically. A more accurate description would be a static shot with minimal handheld shake.\n    *   **\"...focusing on the horse in the foreground with a shallow depth of field.\"** This part of the description is accurate. The focus is clearly on the foreground horse, and the mountains in the background are softly blurred.\n\n*   **Completeness:**\n    *   The caption correctly identifies the focus and depth of field.\n    *   It attempts to describe the angle, height, and movement but does so inaccurately.\n    *   It correctly omits details like video speed and lens distortion, as they are standard.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   The caption attempts to follow the instructions by describing the camera's configuration and movement. However, its failure to describe these elements accurately means it does not fulfill the core requirement of providing an informative and correct description.\n\nIn summary, the caption misrepresents the camera's angle and movement, which are two fundamental aspects of the shot's composition.\n\nA more accurate caption would be:\n\n**This is a static, eye-level shot with a level angle. The camera has a slight handheld wobble and drifts very slowly to the right. The focus is fixed on the horse in the foreground, creating a shallow depth of field that blurs the mountains in the background.**",
