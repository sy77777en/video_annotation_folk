    "pre_caption": "This locked-on shot is captured by a camera mounted on the front of a surfboard, creating a level-angle perspective from just above the water. The video exhibits mild barrel distortion and a varying Dutch angle as the camera rolls and shakes slightly with the board's motion. The camera tracks the board, moving backward as it advances on the wave. As the surfer walks toward the lens, the camera pans left to maintain its alignment, leading her from the front and causing her to grow larger in the frame. A deep focus keeps the surfer and the surrounding wave in sharp detail.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features mild barrel distortion causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is above water.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead). The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The locked-on camera mounted on the surfboard tracks it from the front, moving backward as the board advances. As the surfer walks toward the lens, the camera pans left to stay aligned with the board, while rolling and shaking slightly with its motion.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is leading the subject from the front. During the tracking shot, the subject becomes larger in the frame.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly describes the lens distortion as \"mild barrel distortion\" when it is more pronounced, characteristic of a fisheye lens. The description of the camera movement is also inaccurate; the camera is fixed to the surfboard and does not \"track the board\" or \"pan left\" independently. The camera provides a point-of-view from the board, moving forward with it. The change in the surfer's position within the frame is due to her walking toward the fixed lens, not because the camera is panning to follow her. The phrase \"moving backward as it advances on the wave\" is confusing and should be removed. Finally, the camera \"shakes slightly\" is an understatement; the shaking and rolling are moderate.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This point-of-view shot is captured by a camera fixed to the front of a surfboard, creating a low-angle perspective from just above the water. The use of a wide-angle or fisheye lens creates significant barrel distortion, which curves the horizon. Since the camera is mounted on the board, it moves forward with the surfer on the wave. The camera rolls and shakes moderately with the board's motion, resulting in a varying Dutch angle. As the surfer walks toward the front of the board, she moves closer to the fixed lens, causing her to grow larger in the frame. A deep focus keeps both the surfer and the surrounding wave in sharp detail.",
