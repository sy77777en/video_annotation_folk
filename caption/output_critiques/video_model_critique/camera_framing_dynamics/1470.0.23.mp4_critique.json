    "pre_caption": "The video features a high-angle shot at eye level, focusing on a woman's head amidst scattered toys on the floor. The camera employs a shallow depth of field, concentrating on the midground where the woman's head is located. There is a smooth zoom-in movement, enhancing the focus on the subject without any shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is zooming in.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent attempt. The caption correctly identifies several key aspects of the shot, but it contains a significant inaccuracy regarding the camera angle and height.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\n\n*   **Partially Inaccurate:** The phrase \"high-angle shot at eye level\" is contradictory.\n    *   A **high-angle shot** means the camera is positioned above the subject's eyeline and is tilted down. This part is correct; the camera is looking down at the head on the floor.\n    *   An **eye-level shot** means the camera is placed at the same height as the subject's eyes, creating a neutral perspective. This is incorrect.\n    *   The likely intent was to describe a high-angle shot taken *from* a standing person's eye-level height, but the phrasing is confusing and technically incorrect.\n\n*   **Accurate:** The description of the focus (\"shallow depth of field, concentrating on the midground\") and the camera movement (\"smooth zoom-in movement... without any shaking\") is perfectly accurate.\n\n**Completeness:**\n\n*   The caption covers the most important elements for this clip: angle, focus, and movement. It correctly omits details that are not present (e.g., lens distortion, speed changes), adhering to the instruction for conciseness.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   The caption follows the instructions well by describing the angle, focus, and movement type and quality. The only failure in adherence is the inaccurate and contradictory description of the camera's position.\n\n### Verdict:\n\nThe caption is **not good** due to the critical error in describing the camera's position. The contradictory phrase \"high-angle shot at eye level\" makes the description fundamentally flawed, despite its accuracy in other areas.\n\n### Corrected and Improved Caption:\n\nHere is a more accurate version:\n\n**From a high angle at approximately eye-level height, the camera performs a slow, steady zoom-in on a woman's head on the floor. The shot uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the midground subject in sharp focus while the foreground and background are softly blurred.**",
