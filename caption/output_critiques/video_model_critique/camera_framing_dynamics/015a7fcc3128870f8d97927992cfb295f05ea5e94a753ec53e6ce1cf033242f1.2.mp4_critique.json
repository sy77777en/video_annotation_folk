    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving backward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent analysis. Here is a detailed breakdown of the caption's performance.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\nThe caption is partially accurate but contains significant errors in describing the camera movement and the resulting change in focus, making it a poor description of the video.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n\n*   **Accurate:** The initial description of the camera's configuration is correct. It is indeed at **eye level** with a **level angle**, and the shot uses a **shallow depth of field** to keep the woman in focus while blurring the background.\n*   **Inaccurate:** The description of the camera movement is incorrect. The camera does not move \"backward\" (dolly out). Instead, it **trucks right** (moves horizontally to the right) or performs a **counter-clockwise arc**. This sideways motion is what causes the woman to move to the left of the frame and eventually exit it.\n*   **Inaccurate/Confusing:** The explanation for the blur is wrong. The caption states the woman blurs \"as the focus remains on the foreground.\" This is contradictory, as the woman *is* the foreground/midground subject. The blur is not a result of a focus pull or a fixed focus plane; it is **motion blur** caused by the camera's rapid sideways movement.\n\n**Completeness:**\n\n*   The caption fails to mention the **acceleration** of the camera movement, which starts slow and becomes very fast.\n*   It incorrectly identifies the **type and direction** of the movement (backward vs. sideways).\n*   It misses the key detail that the blur is **motion blur**, a crucial aspect of the shot's visual style.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   The caption attempts to follow the instructions by including details on camera height, angle, focus, and movement.\n*   However, by providing incorrect information about the movement and focus, it fails to deliver the \"informative description\" required by the prompt.\n\n### Corrected Caption Example\n\nHere is a more accurate and complete caption that adheres to the instructions:\n\n**This eye-level, level-angle shot begins with a medium close-up of a woman, who is in sharp focus against a blurry background, indicating a shallow depth of field. The camera then begins to truck right at an accelerating speed. As the camera moves, the woman shifts to the left of the frame and becomes increasingly obscured by motion blur before exiting the shot.**",
