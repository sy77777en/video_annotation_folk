    "pre_caption": "The camera is underwater, initially at a high angle looking down at a sunken shipwreck. It steadily tilts up while panning left, shifting focus to a diver. During this motion, the camera slightly zooms in to emphasize the diver, eventually transitioning to a worm's eye angle. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking. The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is underwater.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above)initially, transitioning to a worm's eye angle at the end.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera steadily tilts up while panning left, shifting focus from the sunken shipwreck to the diver. During the motion, it slightly zooms in to emphasize the diver.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on this caption. It is well-structured, concise, and accurately captures most of the key cinematic elements as requested by the instructions. Here is a detailed breakdown of your analysis:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\n\n*   **Highly Accurate:** Your descriptions of the camera's location (\"underwater\"), initial framing (\"high angle looking down at a sunken shipwreck\"), and overall movement (\"tilts up while panning left\") are spot-on. The identification of the final perspective as a \"worm's eye angle\" is also correct.\n*   **Mostly Accurate:** The description of the movement as \"slightly unsteady with some shaking\" is a good observation, capturing the subtle, organic feel of the camera motion. The claim that the camera \"slightly zooms in\" is a reasonable interpretation of the framing tightening on the diver, though it could also be a subtle dolly or crane movement.\n*   **Area for Improvement:** The statement that \"The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field\" is inaccurate. In a deep focus shot, elements in the foreground, midground, and background would all be sharp. Here, the murky water and lighting create a natural falloff, rendering the background as an indistinct blue gradient. This effect is more characteristic of a **medium or shallow depth of field**, which serves to isolate the subject (first the shipwreck, then the diver) from the vast, empty expanse of the ocean.\n\n**Completeness:**\n\n*   The caption is very complete. It successfully covers the camera's location, angle, complex movement (tilt, pan, zoom), steadiness, and focus, all within a single, flowing description.\n*   You correctly followed the instructions by omitting mentions of video speed, lens distortion, and Dutch angle, as they are not present or are standard.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   You have adhered to the instructions exceptionally well. The caption describes the camera's configuration and movement in a logical sequence, providing a clear picture of the shot's progression. The language is technical yet easy to understand.\n\n### Revised Caption for Greater Accuracy\n\nHere is a revised version of your caption that incorporates the feedback on focus:\n\n\"The camera is underwater, initially at a high angle looking down at a sunken shipwreck. It steadily tilts up while panning left, shifting the composition's subject to a diver. During this motion, the camera slightly zooms in to emphasize the diver, eventually transitioning to a worm's eye angle. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking. The focus remains on the subject, while the murky water creates a shallow depth of field that blurs the background.\"",
