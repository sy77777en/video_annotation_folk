    "pre_caption": "The video is shot at eye level with a level camera angle. It begins with deep focus, capturing both men clearly.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The video starts with deep focus, but as one of the two men walks toward the camera, it shifts to shallow focus, keeping him sharp in the foreground while the background and the midground become blurred.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not entirely accurate. While it correctly identifies most of the camera's technical aspects, it misinterprets the on-screen action that leads to the change in focus.\n\n### Feedback Breakdown:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description of the camera's configuration (static, eye-level, level angle) and the general focus change (from deep to shallow) is correct. However, the caption incorrectly states, \"As one man walks toward the camera...\" In the video, the man in the foreground (in the conductor's hat) is already close and moves his torso slightly closer, while the man in the background (in the Santa hat) walks *away* from the camera. This movement into the background is what primarily causes him to go out of focus as the depth of field becomes shallower.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is very complete. It successfully covers all the relevant points from the instructions: camera height, angle, movement (static), and the dynamic change in focus and depth of field. It correctly omits non-applicable details like video speed or lens distortion.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres well to the instructions by being concise and using the specified terminology. The structure is logical, describing the initial setup and then the change that occurs. The only failure is the factual error in describing the subject's movement.\n\n### Corrected Caption:\n\nHere is a more accurate version of the caption:\n\n**The video is shot with a static, eye-level camera at a level angle. It begins with a relatively deep focus, capturing both men clearly. As the man in the background walks away, the focus becomes shallow, keeping the foreground subject sharp while the midground and background blur.**",
