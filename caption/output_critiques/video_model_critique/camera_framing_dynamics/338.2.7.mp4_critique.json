    "pre_caption": "The video features mild barrel distortion, causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward. The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle. It uses a shallow depth of field, focusing on the midground, specifically on the individuals at the table. The camera smoothly pans left, maintaining steadiness throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features mild barrel distortion causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is panning left.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Your feedback on the caption is as follows:\n\nThe provided caption is inaccurate and incomplete, failing to describe the most prominent visual characteristics of the video.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **Camera Movement:** The description of the movement as a \"smoothly pans left, maintaining steadiness\" is incorrect. The camera performs a very fast, unsteady pan (a \"whip pan\") to the left. This rapid, jarring movement is the defining feature of the shot and is the direct cause of the extreme motion blur. It is the opposite of smooth and steady.\n*   **Lens Distortion:** The claim of \"mild barrel distortion\" is not the most accurate description of the visual effect. The image is dominated by severe **motion blur** resulting from the fast camera movement, not by the static curvature of lens distortion.\n*   **Focus:** While the depth of field is shallow, the caption is misleading by not mentioning that the extreme motion blur makes even the subjects in the focal plane appear blurry and indistinct.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption completely omits the **speed** and **unsteadiness** of the camera movement, which are the most critical elements of the shot's configuration and visual style. The instructions specifically ask to describe speed and steadiness, both of which are defining features here.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   The caption fails to provide a truly \"informative description\" because it misrepresents the core action and visual effect. By describing the movement as smooth and steady, it fundamentally misunderstands and miscommunicates the shot's dynamic and chaotic nature.\n\nIn summary, the caption correctly identifies the camera's height and angle but is highly inaccurate regarding the camera's movement, steadiness, and the primary visual effect (motion blur vs. lens distortion).",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera, positioned at eye level with a level angle, performs an extremely fast and unsteady pan to the left, a technique known as a whip pan. This rapid movement is the defining characteristic of the shot, creating severe horizontal motion blur that streaks the entire image and makes all details indistinct. Due to the speed of the pan, even the subjects in the shallow depth of field's focal plane are rendered completely blurry.",
