    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward, moving up, and moving right.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent analysis. Here is a detailed breakdown of the provided caption's accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\nThe caption is a good start but contains one inaccuracy and omits two very prominent visual characteristics of the shot, making it incomplete.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n\n*   **Accurate:**\n    *   **\"camera at eye level\"**: This is a reasonable description, as the camera is positioned behind the subject at roughly her head/shoulder height.\n    *   **\"with a low angle, looking up\"**: Correct. The camera is clearly tilted upward to capture the length of the escalator and the ceiling.\n    *   **\"It employs deep focus with a large depth of field\"**: Correct. The subject, the escalator, and the ceiling in the background are all in sharp focus.\n    *   **\"moves smoothly forward, upward\"**: Correct. The camera is on the escalator, creating a smooth dolly/pedestal movement.\n    *   **\"focusing on a woman ascending an escalator\"**: Correct. She is the central subject.\n\n*   **Inaccurate:**\n    *   **\"...and to the right\"**: This is incorrect. The camera does not move horizontally to the right (a trucking motion). It moves in a straight line, following the path of the escalator.\n\n**Completeness & Adherence to Instructions:**\n\nThe caption fails to describe two critical visual elements that define the shot's style:\n\n*   **Missing - Lens Distortion:** The video has very strong **wide-angle lens distortion**. This is evident in the way the straight lines of the tiled walls and the ceiling curve dramatically, creating a warped, almost fisheye effect. This is a significant stylistic choice that should be mentioned.\n*   **Missing - Dutch Angle:** The camera is tilted on its roll axis, meaning the horizon (in this case, the horizontal lines of the escalator steps) is not parallel to the bottom of the frame. This is a **Dutch angle**, which adds a sense of unease or dynamism to the shot and is a required element to describe according to the instructions.\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised caption that is more accurate and complete according to the provided instructions:\n\n\"From a low, Dutch angle at eye-level, this shot exhibits significant wide-angle distortion that curves the surrounding architecture. The camera maintains a deep focus as it tracks smoothly forward and upward, following a woman on an escalator.\"",
