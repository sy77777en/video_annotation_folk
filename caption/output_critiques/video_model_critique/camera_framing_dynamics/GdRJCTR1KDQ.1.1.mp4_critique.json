    "pre_caption": "This slow-motion video is captured from a static camera positioned at ground level, looking down at the scene from a high angle. The camera utilizes a shallow depth of field, initially focusing on the monitor in the foreground. As the monitor is struck and debris moves into the midground, the focus shifts to follow these pieces.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A slow-motion video with forward playback speed slower than real-time.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a ground level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on identifying the key visual elements and adhering to the detailed instructions. The caption correctly identifies the video speed, camera movement, and depth of field. However, there are a few inaccuracies regarding the camera's position and focus changes.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of your caption:\n\n**Critique:**\n\n*   **\"This slow-motion video is captured from a static camera...\"**: **Accurate.** The action is clearly in slow motion, and the camera's frame is fixed.\n*   **\"...positioned at ground level, looking down at the scene from a high angle.\"**: **Partially Inaccurate & Contradictory.** While the camera is at a low height, it is not at \"ground level.\" It's positioned high enough to look *down* on the monitor, creating a \"high angle.\" A camera at true ground level would be looking up or level with the base of the monitor. The description \"ground level\" and \"high angle\" are contradictory in this context. A more accurate description would be \"a low-height camera captures the scene from a high angle.\"\n*   **\"The camera utilizes a shallow depth of field...\"**: **Accurate.** The background (the red door) is clearly out of focus, isolating the subject.\n*   **\"...initially focusing on the monitor in the foreground.\"**: **Inaccurate.** The monitor is the primary subject and is located in the **midground**. The immediate foreground is the concrete just in front of the lens.\n*   **\"As the monitor is struck and debris moves into the midground, the focus shifts to follow these pieces.\"**: **Inaccurate.** This is the most significant error. The focus is **static** throughout the entire shot. It remains locked on the original position of the monitor. There is no rack focus or focus tracking; the debris that flies closer to or farther from the camera goes out of focus, while the main shattered body of the monitor stays sharp.\n\n**Summary of Feedback:**\n\nThe caption correctly identifies that the video is a static, slow-motion shot with a shallow depth of field. However, it mischaracterizes the camera's height, the subject's position in the frame (midground vs. foreground), and incorrectly claims there is a dynamic focus shift when the focus is actually static.\n\n**Improved Caption Example:**\n\nThis slow-motion video is captured from a static, low-height camera using a high angle. The shot has a shallow depth of field, with the focus fixed on the computer monitor in the midground throughout the clip.",
