    "pre_caption": "The video is shot from an eye-level height with a high angle, looking down at a person sketching in a notebook. The camera employs an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the midground where the drawing is being made. The camera motion is quite unsteady and lacks a clear pattern, adding a dynamic feel to the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses an extremely shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is quite unsteady, but its motion lacks a clear pattern.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on this caption. It accurately captures the key visual elements of the video while adhering to the provided instructions. Here is a detailed breakdown of your description:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**\"The video is shot from an eye-level height with a high angle, looking down at a person sketching in a notebook.\"**\n\n*   **Accuracy:** This is mostly accurate. \"High angle\" is correct, as the camera is clearly looking down. \"Eye-level height\" is slightly ambiguous in this context; while the camera operator might be at eye level with the seated subject, the shot itself is a close-up where the angle is the more defining characteristic. A more precise description might be \"a close-up, high-angle shot.\"\n*   **Completeness:** This part effectively sets the scene and describes the basic framing.\n\n**\"The camera employs an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the midground where the drawing is being made.\"**\n\n*   **Accuracy:** This is perfectly accurate. The depth of field is indeed extremely shallow, with only the pen tip and the immediate area of the drawing in sharp focus. The fingers and the rest of the notebook are softly blurred.\n*   **Completeness:** This is a complete and excellent description of the video's focus.\n\n**\"The camera motion is quite unsteady and lacks a clear pattern, adding a dynamic feel to the scene.\"**\n\n*   **Accuracy:** This is a great description. The camera has a subtle, organic, handheld wobble rather than a defined movement like a pan or track. \"Unsteady\" and \"lacks a clear pattern\" are very fitting terms.\n*   **Completeness:** This accurately describes the nature of the camera's movement.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows the instructions well. It is concise, focuses on the specified technical aspects (angle, height, focus, movement), and correctly omits details like video speed and lens distortion, which are standard in this clip.\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is clear and effective.\n\n### Suggested Improvement for Greater Precision\n\nTo make the caption even more precise, you could refine the description of the camera's position and movement slightly.\n\n**Revised Caption Example:**\n\n\"This close-up, high-angle shot looks down at a person sketching in a notebook. The camera uses an extremely shallow depth of field, keeping the focus tight on the pen tip and the drawing. The shot has a subtle, unsteady handheld motion, drifting slightly without a defined pattern.\"",
