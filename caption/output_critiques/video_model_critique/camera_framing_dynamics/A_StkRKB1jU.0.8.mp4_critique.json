    "pre_caption": "This is an eye-level, slightly unsteady shot that moves backward to follow two men in clown masks as they run through a long hall. In the latter part of the clip, the camera also trucks slightly to the right. The video uses a shallow depth of field, but the rapid movement of both the camera and the subjects causes them to frequently shift in and out of focus.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The video uses shallow focus, but the camera and subjects' movements cause subjects to alternate between being in and out of focus, making it hard to determine the depth of camera focus.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves backward, adding a slight truck to the right in the latter part of the video.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on this caption. It accurately captures the key visual and technical elements of the shot while remaining concise. Here’s a detailed breakdown based on your instructions:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **\"eye-level, slightly unsteady shot\"**: This is perfectly accurate. The camera is positioned at a natural height, and the slight wobble gives the shot a chaotic, handheld feel that matches the action.\n*   **\"...moves backward to follow two men...\"**: The camera is indeed moving backward (a dolly out) and tracking the subjects. However, since the men are running *away* from the camera's initial position, the phrasing \"moves backward to follow\" can be slightly ambiguous. It's technically correct but could be clearer.\n*   **\"In the latter part of the clip, the camera also trucks slightly to the right.\"**: This is the main point of inaccuracy. The camera trucks right simultaneously with its backward dolly movement throughout the entire shot, not just in the latter part. The combined movement keeps the subjects framed as they run down the hall.\n*   **\"The video uses a shallow depth of field, but the rapid movement... causes them to frequently shift in and out of focus.\"**: This is an excellent and precise observation. It correctly identifies both the shallow depth of field and the dynamic focus issues caused by the fast action, which is a key stylistic choice in the scene.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully covers the most important aspects required by the instructions: camera height/angle, movement, steadiness, and focus.\n*   It correctly omits mentions of video speed, lens distortion, and Dutch angles, as none are present.\n*   It could be slightly more complete by using more specific terminology for the camera movement (e.g., \"dollies backward and trucks right\").\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   The caption is concise and informative, as requested.\n*   It effectively describes the camera's configuration and dynamic properties without being overly verbose.\n*   It correctly focuses on describing the \"how\" (the technical aspects) rather than just the \"what\" (the narrative content).\n\n### Suggested Improvement\n\nTo enhance accuracy and clarity, you could combine the description of the camera's movement into a single, more precise statement.\n\n**Improved Caption:**\n\"This is an eye-level, slightly unsteady tracking shot. The camera dollies backward and trucks right to follow two men in clown masks as they run down a long hall. The shot uses a shallow depth of field, and the rapid movement of both the camera and subjects causes them to frequently shift in and out of focus.\"",
