    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an overhead level (around second floor height).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on the caption. It correctly identifies several key aspects of the shot, but there are a few inaccuracies regarding the camera angle. Here is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n*   **Accuracy:**\n    *   **Correct:** The caption is right to describe the shot as **static** and employing **deep focus**. The camera does not move, and the entire scene from the foreground to the background is kept in focus.\n    *   **Incorrect:** The description of the camera angle is inaccurate.\n        *   While the camera is high up, calling it a \"level angle looking straight ahead\" is incorrect. A level angle means the camera is parallel to the ground, looking straight at a subject at its own height.\n        *   In this video, the camera is positioned high and tilted **downward** to look at the scene below. This is a classic **high-angle shot**.\n\n*   **Completeness:**\n    *   The caption effectively covers the most important camera attributes for this static shot: its lack of movement, its height, and its focus. It correctly omits unnecessary details like normal video speed and the absence of lens distortion, following the instructions well.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   The caption adheres well to the instructions by focusing on the technical configuration of the camera. The final clause describing the content (\"a river landscape with trees and wildlife\") is acceptable for providing context, though the primary focus should remain on the camera work.\n\n### Suggested Improvement\n\nTo improve accuracy, the description of the camera's angle and height should be revised.\n\n**Here is a more accurate version of the caption:**\n\n\"The video consists of a static, high-angle shot from an elevated position. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire river landscape, from the elephant in the foreground to the trees in the background, in sharp focus.\"",
