    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A slow-motion video with forward playback speed slower than real-time.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The video shows a woman in a white dress standing on a rooftop at night, with the moon visible in the background. The scene transitions from out of focus to deep focus.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on the caption. It is concise and correctly identifies several key aspects of the shot. Here is a detailed breakdown of its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\n\n*   **Mostly Accurate:** The descriptions of the video as **slow-motion**, captured from a **fixed, slightly unsteady, eye-level camera** at a **level angle** are all correct and well-observed. The camera is static, but there is a very subtle wobble, making \"slightly unsteady\" a precise detail.\n*   **Inaccurate:** The description of the focus is incorrect. The video **does not** begin out of focus and then transition. From the very first frame, the woman and the scene are in focus. There is no focus pull or rack focus effect. The depth of field is relatively deep, keeping the woman, the wall behind her, and the foreground sharp.\n\n**Completeness:**\n\n*   The caption is very complete in its description of the camera's position and movement, correctly noting its static nature, height, and angle.\n*   It correctly identifies the video speed.\n*   It correctly omits any mention of lens distortion or Dutch angles, as none are present.\n*   The description of the focus is incomplete because it is based on an incorrect observation. A complete description would state that the shot maintains a deep focus on the woman in the midground throughout the clip.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   The caption adheres well to the instructions by providing a concise description of the video and camera configuration.\n*   It successfully covers video speed, camera movement, angle, and height.\n*   The primary area where it fails to adhere is in providing an accurate description of the focus, which is a key requirement of the prompt.\n\n### Revised Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised version of the caption that corrects the inaccuracy:\n\n\"This slow-motion video is captured from a fixed, slightly unsteady, eye-level camera at a level angle. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the woman in the midground and her surroundings on the rooftop sharp throughout.\"",
