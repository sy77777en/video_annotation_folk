    "pre_caption": "The video features a handheld camera at eye level, initially capturing a rainbow from a low angle and then shifting to a level angle. The camera pans left to reveal the full extent of the rainbow, tilting up initially and then down. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking. The camera maintains deep focus with a large depth of field throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a low angle (looking up from below) and then changes to a level angle (looking straight ahead) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The handheld camera pans left to reveal the full extent of the rainbow, tilting up initially, then down to show it.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on the caption. It is accurate, concise, and adheres well to the provided instructions. Here is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate.\n    *   \"handheld camera at eye level\": Correct. The slight shakiness and the final perspective support this.\n    *   \"initially capturing a rainbow from a low angle and then shifting to a level angle\": Correct. The shot begins by looking up towards the sky and ends with a more horizontal view of the street.\n    *   \"The camera pans left...\": Correct. This is the primary horizontal movement.\n    *   \"...tilting up initially and then down.\": This is the only minor point of ambiguity. The camera *starts* in a tilted-up position. The movement itself is a downward tilt that occurs as it pans left. A slightly more precise phrasing would be: \"Starting from a tilted-up position, the camera pans left while tilting down...\" However, the current phrasing is still understandable.\n    *   \"The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\": Correct. This accurately describes the handheld nature of the shot.\n    *   \"The camera maintains deep focus with a large depth of field throughout.\": Correct. The foreground trees, midground power lines, and background sky are all in sharp focus.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is very complete. It successfully covers all the relevant aspects of the camera's configuration and movement as requested in the instructions (height, angle, movement types, steadiness, and focus). It correctly omits details that are not present, such as video speed alterations or lens distortion.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instruction:** The caption follows the instructions perfectly. It uses the specified terminology (pan, tilt, low/level angle, deep focus) and provides a concise summary of the camera work in a single, continuous shot.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is excellent. It provides a clear and technically sound description of the video's cinematography. The minor point about the tilt's description is a very fine detail, and the current caption is already very effective.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "Shot with a handheld camera at eye level, the video begins from a low, upward-tilted angle on a rainbow. The camera then pans left while tilting down, revealing more of the rainbow and the street below before settling at a level angle. The movement is slightly unsteady, and the shot maintains deep focus with a large depth of field throughout.",
