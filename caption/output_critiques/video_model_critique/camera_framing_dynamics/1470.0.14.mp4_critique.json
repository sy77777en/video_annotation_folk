    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is zooming in.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is good, but it could be improved for clarity and technical precision.\n\n### Feedback:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is mostly accurate. It correctly identifies the shallow depth of field, the focus on the subject, and the slight shakiness. The description of the movement as a \"zoom in\" is a reasonable interpretation of the effect, although it could also be a slow dolly-in. The main point of confusion is the description of the camera position.\n*   **Completeness:** The caption successfully covers the most important aspects requested in the instructions (angle, height, focus, movement) while correctly omitting non-notable elements like the regular video speed and lack of lens distortion.\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres well to the instructions for conciseness and content.\n\n### Suggested Improvements:\n\n1.  **Clarify Camera Position:** The phrase \"at eye level with a low angle, looking up\" is slightly redundant and confusing. A \"low angle\" shot inherently means the camera is looking up. Combining it with \"eye level\" can be contradictory. A more precise and clearer description would be:\n    *   \"This is a low-angle shot from approximately eye level...\"\n    *   Or more simply, just \"This is a low-angle shot...\" since the angle is the most defining characteristic of the framing.\n\n2.  **Specify Movement (Optional but more precise):** The movement appears to be a slow **dolly-in** (the camera physically moving forward) rather than a zoom, as the spatial relationship between the subject and the background shifts slightly. Using \"slowly dollying in\" is more technically accurate than \"zooming in.\"\n\n### Revised Caption Example:\n\nHere is a revised version incorporating the feedback:\n\n**\"This low-angle, eye-level shot uses a shallow depth of field to keep the man in the midground in sharp focus. The camera slowly dollies in on him with a slight, unsettling shakiness.\"**",
