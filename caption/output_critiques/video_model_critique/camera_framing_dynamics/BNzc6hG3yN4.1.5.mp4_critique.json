    "pre_caption": "The video features deep focus, maintaining clarity throughout. The camera movement is smooth, with no shaking. However, due to the lack of background information, it's challenging to determine the camera height, angle, or specific movements.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** It lacks background information, making it hard to determine the camera height.\n\n**Camera Angle:** It lacks background information, making it hard to determine the camera angle.\n\n**Camera Focus:** It appears to be deep focus, but the Lack of background information makes it hard to determine the camera height.\n\n**Camera Motion:** There isn't enough background information to analyze the camera movement. It is hard to determine whether the camera is moving forward, moving down, or zooming in.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption omits several key details required by the instruction. It does not mention that the video is presented upside down, indicating a fixed Dutch angle (rotated 180 degrees), which is a significant aspect of the camera configuration. The camera height and angle are not specified; the shot appears to be at ground-level and at a level angle relative to the subject’s face. The caption correctly notes the shallow focus and the gradual movement closer to the eye, but it should clarify that the camera both dollies in (moves forward) and rotates counter-clockwise, and that the movement is smooth and steady. There is no mention of video speed (which appears normal), lens distortion (none apparent), or any changes in focus plane (focus remains on the face/eye throughout). To improve, the caption should state: “The video is presented upside down with a fixed Dutch angle (180-degree roll). The camera is at ground-level, positioned at a level angle to the subject’s face. It smoothly dollies in while rotating counter-clockwise, culminating in an extreme close-up of the eye. Shallow focus keeps the face and eye sharp, with the background blurred. Video speed is normal and there is no noticeable lens distortion.”",
