    "pre_caption": "The video features an eye-level camera capturing a low-angle shot, looking up at the subjects. It employs a shallow depth of field, focusing on the old man in the midground. The camera movement is slightly unsteady, with some shaking, and it captures an over-the-shoulder shot, centering the old man.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera captures an unsteady over-the-shoulder shot, centering the old man in the middle ground.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption provides a good overview, but there are some inaccuracies and areas for improvement in terms of precision and clarity.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption:\n\n**\"The video features an eye-level camera capturing a low-angle shot, looking up at the subjects.\"**\n\n*   **Accuracy:** This statement is contradictory. An \"eye-level\" shot implies the camera is level with the subject's eyes. A \"low-angle\" shot means the camera is positioned below the subject's eye line and tilted upward. The shot is indeed a **low-angle shot**, as the camera is looking up at the older man. However, describing the camera's height as \"eye-level\" is confusing and likely incorrect. The camera appears to be positioned around the shoulder height of the person in the foreground.\n*   **Completeness:** It correctly identifies the angle. The phrase \"looking up at the subjects\" is redundant with \"low-angle shot\" but not incorrect.\n\n**\"It employs a shallow depth of field, focusing on the old man in the midground.\"**\n\n*   **Accuracy:** This is perfectly accurate. The older man's face is in sharp focus, while the boy's shoulder in the foreground and the wall in the background are both blurred.\n*   **Completeness:** This is a complete and well-described observation.\n\n**\"The camera movement is slightly unsteady, with some shaking...\"**\n\n*   **Accuracy:** This is correct. The camera is not perfectly static; there is a very subtle wobble characteristic of a handheld shot, which you've accurately described as \"slightly unsteady.\"\n*   **Completeness:** This accurately captures the nature of the camera's stability.\n\n**\"...and it captures an over-the-shoulder shot, centering the old man.\"**\n\n*   **Accuracy:** This is also correct. The framing is a classic **over-the-shoulder shot**, which is a crucial detail. The man is the clear subject and occupies the center of visual interest, so \"centering the old man\" is an appropriate description of the composition.\n*   **Completeness:** This is a good description of the shot's framing.\n\n### Summary and Final Recommendation:\n\nThe caption is mostly accurate but fails on the description of camera height and angle. The terms \"eye-level\" and \"low-angle\" are used together in a way that contradicts their definitions. The rest of the description regarding depth of field, focus, steadiness, and shot type is excellent.\n\nA more accurate and clear caption would be:\n\n**\"This low-angle, over-the-shoulder shot is captured by a slightly unsteady camera. It uses a shallow depth of field to keep the older man in the midground in sharp focus, while the foreground and background remain blurred.\"**",
