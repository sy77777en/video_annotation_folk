    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is zooming in.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "An evaluation of the caption is below.\n\n**Evaluation:**\nThe caption is mostly accurate but contains some imprecise and contradictory phrasing that could be improved for clarity and correctness.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **Correct:** The identification of a \"high angle,\" \"shallow depth of field,\" and \"focus on the person in the midground\" is accurate. The camera is positioned above the subject, and the background is clearly out of focus.\n*   **Incorrect/Imprecise:**\n    *   The term \"hip level\" is speculative. While the camera is not extremely high, its height relative to the ground is impossible to determine from the shot. It's more accurate to describe its position relative to the subject (e.g., \"positioned slightly above the subject\").\n    *   The phrase \"with minor movement, maintaining steadiness\" is contradictory. The shot is exceptionally steady, with the only movement being a very slow zoom. The term \"minor movement\" incorrectly implies unintended motion like a slight shake or drift.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption covers the most relevant aspects: camera angle, depth of field, focus, and movement (zoom and steadiness). It correctly omits details about video speed and lens distortion, as they appear to be standard.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   The caption attempts to follow the instructions but falls short in its precision. The instruction to describe steadiness was misinterpreted, leading to the contradictory phrase. The phrase \"looking down\" is also redundant, as \"high angle\" already implies this.\n\n**Suggested Improvement:**\nA more accurate and concise caption would be:\n\n\"From a steady, high-angle position, the camera performs a slow zoom-in on a person in a bathtub. The shot utilizes a shallow depth of field, keeping the person in the midground in sharp focus.\"",
