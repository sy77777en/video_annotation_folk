    "pre_caption": "The video features noticeable fisheye distortion, causing straight lines to curve outward. The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle while incorporating a varying Dutch angle due to rolling. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera pans right with unsteady movement, exhibiting noticeable shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features noticable fisheye distortion causing straight lines to curve outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead). The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is panning right.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent analysis. Here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\nThe caption is partially accurate but fails to meet the instructions' requirements for completeness and precision.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **Correct:** The caption accurately identifies the \"noticeable fisheye distortion,\" the \"deep focus with a large depth of field,\" and the \"unsteady movement\" with \"noticeable shaking\" in the first part of the video.\n*   **Incorrect:** The use of \"varying Dutch angle\" is inaccurate. A Dutch angle is a deliberate, sustained tilt of the camera for artistic effect. The momentary tilting seen here is simply incidental rolling caused by unsteady, handheld-style movement, not a compositional choice.\n*   **Partially Correct:** The camera is at \"eye level\" in the first shot, but it appears lower in the second shot. The caption incorrectly applies this attribute to the entire video.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   **Major Omission:** The most significant failure is that the caption completely ignores the **hard cut** at 00:01 and the entire second shot. The instructions explicitly require describing shot transitions and the camera work in each segment. The caption only describes the first second of the video.\n*   **Incomplete Movement Description:** The caption only mentions the \"pans right\" movement. It omits the initial forward dolly movement in the first shot and the forward movement with a slight turn in the second shot.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   The caption fails to follow the instruction to \"describe the camera framing and movement in each segment separately\" and \"note the type of transition.\"\n*   By only describing the first shot, it does not provide a description of the **video's** configuration, but rather a small fraction of it.\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is a more accurate and complete caption that adheres to the provided instructions:\n\n\"The video, which exhibits significant fisheye distortion and deep focus throughout, consists of two shots joined by a hard cut.\n\nThe first shot (00:00-00:01) is an unsteady, eye-level point-of-view shot. The camera dollies forward briefly before performing a rapid, shaky pan to the right, creating significant motion blur.\n\nThe second shot (00:01-00:02) is from a lower perspective, likely a vehicle's dashboard. The camera moves steadily forward and makes a slight left turn while navigating a street intersection.\"",
