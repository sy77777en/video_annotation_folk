    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera focus is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera remains stationary for a moment at the beginning. Then it starts zooming in with a slight downward tilt.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption provides a good, basic overview of the video's camera work, but it could be more precise and complete according to the instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description of the movement as a \"slight downward tilt\" is inaccurate. A **tilt** is a vertical rotation of the camera on a fixed axis. In this 2D animation, the camera is not tilting; it is **panning** or **trucking** (translating) across the map's surface while simultaneously zooming in. The rest of the description is accurate.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is missing some key details:\n    *   It doesn't specify the **camera angle**, which is a consistent **bird's-eye view**.\n    *   It omits any description of the **focus**. Since this is a 2D graphic, it's helpful to note that everything remains in sharp focus with no depth of field.\n    *   It simplifies the movement to just a \"zoom,\" whereas it's a combination of a zoom and a pan.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption correctly identifies the initial static shot and the subsequent smooth movement. It also correctly omits details like video speed and lens distortion, as they are standard. However, it fails to use the correct terminology for the camera movement (pan/truck vs. tilt).\n\n### Improved Caption\n\nHere is a more accurate and comprehensive caption that adheres to the provided instructions:\n\n**The video opens with a static, bird's-eye view of a world map. The camera then performs a smooth, continuous digital zoom and pan, moving down and across the map to center on the country of Uruguay, which becomes highlighted. The entire animation is in sharp focus, and the movement is perfectly steady.**",
