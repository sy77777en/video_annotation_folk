    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses an extremely shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on providing a concise caption. Here is a detailed breakdown of its accuracy and completeness based on the instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Caption:** \"The video features a static camera at a level angle, focusing on a screw in the midground with an extremely shallow depth of field, causing the background and foreground to blur significantly.\"\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **\"static camera\"**: Correct. The camera's position and framing do not change.\n*   **\"at a level angle\"**: Partially correct but misleading. While the camera is horizontally level (no Dutch angle), its position is very low, almost on the same surface as the screw. A more accurate description would be **\"low-angle\"** or **\"ground-level.\"**\n*   **\"focusing on a screw\"**: Inaccurate. The shot begins with the focus on a hand holding a screwdriver. The hand then moves away, leaving the screw in the same plane of focus. The caption only describes the final state of the shot, missing the initial subject and action.\n*   **\"in the midground\"**: The screw is positioned in the **foreground**, very close to the camera.\n*   **\"with an extremely shallow depth of field, causing the background and foreground to blur significantly\"**: Correct. This accurately describes the visual style of the shot, with prominent bokeh in the background and a soft-focus foreground.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption fails to mention the primary action in the video: the hand and screwdriver moving away to reveal the screw. It describes a static scene rather than the action that occurs within the static shot.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions:\nThe caption adheres to the instruction for conciseness and correctly omits details about normal video speed and lack of lens distortion. However, it falls short in accurately describing the camera angle and the full context of the shot's focus and subject matter.\n\n### Suggested Improved Caption:\n\nHere is a revised caption that is more accurate and complete:\n\n**\"This is a static, ground-level, low-angle shot with an extremely shallow depth of field. The focus is fixed on the foreground, initially capturing a hand and screwdriver, which then pull away to leave a single screw in sharp focus against a heavily blurred background.\"**",
