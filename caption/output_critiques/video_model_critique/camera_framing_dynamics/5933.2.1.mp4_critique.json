    "pre_caption": "The video begins with the camera at ground level, capturing a high angle view of grass in the foreground. It uses a shallow depth of field, initially focusing on the grass. The camera then moves forward and tilts up, transitioning to a level angle as it shifts focus to the midground, where a person’s legs are visible. This focus change is achieved through a rack focus. The camera movement is unsteady, with noticeable shaking throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a ground level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a high angle (looking down from above) and then changes to a level angle (looking straight ahead) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera starts focused on the foreground, and later becomes focused on the midground. The focus plane changes through a rack focus.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is moving forward and tilting up.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed evaluation of your caption:\n\n### Evaluation\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is mostly accurate but contains a significant error in describing the camera angle.\n    *   **Correct:** The descriptions of camera height (\"ground level\"), depth of field (\"shallow\"), initial focus (\"on the grass\"), camera movement (\"moves forward and tilts up\"), focus change (\"shifts focus to the midground,\" \"rack focus\"), and steadiness (\"unsteady, with noticeable shaking\") are all correct.\n    *   **Incorrect:** The phrase \"capturing a high angle view of grass\" is incorrect. A high angle means the camera is positioned above the subject and looking down. In the video, the camera is at ground level, looking up or straight through the grass, which constitutes a **low angle** or **level angle** shot.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is very complete. It successfully identifies and describes all the key elements requested in the instructions, including camera height, angle, movement (translation and rotation), focus (depth, plane, and change), and steadiness.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres well to the instructions by breaking down the shot's technical components. However, the inaccurate use of \"high angle\" is a notable deviation from correct cinematographic terminology.\n\n### Suggested Improvement\n\nHere is a revised version of the caption that corrects the error and improves conciseness:\n\n**Revised Caption:**\nThe video opens with a shaky, ground-level, **low-angle** shot through blades of grass in the foreground. Using a shallow depth of field, the focus is initially on the grass. The camera then dollies forward and tilts up, performing a rack focus to the midground to reveal a person's legs wading through water, ending at a level angle.",
