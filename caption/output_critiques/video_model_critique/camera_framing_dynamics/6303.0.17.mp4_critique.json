    "pre_caption": "The video features mild barrel distortion, causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward. The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle while incorporating a varying Dutch angle due to counterclockwise rolling.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features mild barrel distortion causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead). The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is rolling counterclockwise.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving quickly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "The provided caption is a decent starting point but lacks the detail and accuracy required by the instructions, particularly concerning the camera's movement and lens distortion.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the caption's accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions:\n\n### Caption Feedback\n\n**\"The video features mild barrel distortion, causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward.\"**\n\n*   **Accuracy:** While there is distortion, describing it as \"mild barrel distortion\" is inaccurate. The effect is much more pronounced, characteristic of a very wide-angle or even a fisheye lens. The distortion creates a significant swirling and warping effect at the edges of the frame, which is a primary stylistic element of the shot, not a mild artifact.\n*   **Completeness:** This description is incomplete as it downplays the intensity and stylistic importance of the distortion.\n\n**\"The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle while incorporating a varying Dutch angle due to counterclockwise rolling.\"**\n\n*   **Accuracy:** \"Eye level\" is a reasonable assessment. The description of a \"varying Dutch angle due to counterclockwise rolling\" is accurate and well-observed. However, the phrase \"maintains a level angle\" is slightly misleading, as the constant rolling is the dominant characteristic, creating a sense of disorientation rather than stability.\n*   **Completeness:** This part is good but could be phrased more clearly to emphasize the disorienting roll over a stable level angle.\n\n**\"It employs a shallow depth of field, focusing on the man in the foreground.\"**\n\n*   **Accuracy & Completeness:** This statement is perfectly accurate and complete. It correctly identifies the shallow depth of field and the focus plane.\n\n**\"The camera movement is smooth and quick.\"**\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The movement is indeed smooth and quick.\n*   **Completeness:** This is the weakest part of the caption. It is far too generic and fails to adhere to the instructions, which ask for specific types of movement (arcing, tracking, etc.). The camera is performing a complex movement: it is **arcing clockwise** around the subject while simultaneously **rolling counterclockwise**. This combination of movements is what creates the dynamic, vortex-like effect. The caption completely omits the crucial arcing motion.\n\n### Summary and Recommendation\n\nThe caption correctly identifies the shallow depth of field and the camera's roll but fails to accurately describe the intensity of the lens distortion and, most importantly, misses the key arcing movement. To better adhere to the instructions, the caption should be more specific and descriptive.\n\nHere is a revised caption that more accurately reflects the video based on the instructions:\n\n**Revised Caption Example:**\n*This eye-level shot features significant wide-angle lens distortion, creating a swirling effect at the frame's edges. The camera executes a rapid and smooth movement, **arcing clockwise** around the central subject while simultaneously **rolling counterclockwise**, which creates a dynamic and disorienting Dutch angle. A shallow depth of field keeps the man in the foreground sharply in focus while blurring the background.*",
