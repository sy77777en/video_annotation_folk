    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a low angle (looking up from below) and then changes to a level angle (looking straight ahead) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera inside the car moves slowly and randomly, creating a casual feel as it showcases the car's interior.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on creating a caption that covers several key aspects of the video. Here is a detailed breakdown of its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Caption:** \"With slow, smooth, and random movement, the camera showcases the car's interior. The shot begins at a low angle and transitions to a level angle. A shallow depth of field keeps the midground elements of the car's interior in focus.\"\n\n---\n\n#### **Accuracy:**\n\n*   **\"slow, smooth\"**: This is **accurate**. The camera movement is indeed slow and steady.\n*   **\"random movement\"**: This is **inaccurate**. The movement is not random; it's a single, deliberate **tilt down**. It starts with a view of the upper part of the seat and sunroof and moves vertically downward to reveal the rear air vents on the center console.\n*   **\"The shot begins at a low angle and transitions to a level angle.\"**: This is **inaccurate**. The camera starts at a relatively low angle (looking slightly up at the sunroof) and **tilts down**, ending at an even lower angle. It does not transition to a level angle.\n*   **\"A shallow depth of field\"**: This is **accurate**. The background outside the car is significantly blurred.\n*   **\"keeps the midground elements... in focus.\"**: This is **inaccurate**. The sharpest focus is on the **foreground** element—the back of the seat closest to the camera. The midground (the passenger seat) is slightly less sharp, and the background is completely out of focus.\n\n#### **Completeness:**\n\n*   The caption successfully identifies the speed and steadiness of the movement, the purpose of the shot (\"showcases the car's interior\"), and the use of a shallow depth of field.\n*   It is incomplete because it fails to specify the **type** of camera movement, which is a **tilt down**. Using a more specific term like \"tilt\" is more informative than the general \"movement.\"\n\n#### **Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   The caption attempts to follow the instructions by describing movement, angle, and focus.\n*   However, it lacks the precision required by the instructions. The mischaracterization of the movement as \"random,\" the incorrect description of the angle change, and the misidentification of the focus plane detract from its overall quality.\n\n---\n\n### **Revised Caption Example:**\n\nHere is a more accurate and descriptive caption that adheres more closely to the instructions:\n\n\"From a low angle inside a car, the camera performs a slow, steady tilt down to reveal the rear center console. The shot maintains a shallow depth of field, keeping the foreground seat in sharp focus while blurring the background.\"",
