    "pre_caption": "The video features a camera at eye level, starting with a level angle that shifts to a low angle as the astronaut looks upward, then returns to level when the astronaut lowers their head. The camera employs a shallow depth of field, focusing on the astronaut in the midground. It remains mostly stationary but exhibits slight shakiness, tilting up and down to follow the astronaut's head movements.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The video begins with a level angle, which shifts to a low angle as the character looks upward. When the character lowers their head back to a normal position, the angle returns to level.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera stays mostly stationary but shaky, tilting up and down slightly to follow the astronaut's head movements.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption is very good. It accurately captures the key technical elements of the shot according to the instructions. Here is a detailed breakdown of your caption's performance:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **Camera Height & Angle:** Your description of the camera being at \"eye level\" is correct. Your observation that the angle shifts from \"level\" to \"low angle\" as it follows the astronaut's upward gaze is also accurate from the perspective of the subject's face.\n*   **Focus & Depth of Field:** \"Shallow depth of field, focusing on the astronaut in the midground\" is a perfect description. The focus is clearly on the character, with both the foreground and background elements (the bookshelves) being out of focus.\n*   **Movement:** Identifying the camera as \"mostly stationary but exhibits slight shakiness\" is spot on. It's not a locked-down tripod shot; there's a subtle, organic quality to it. The description of it \"tilting up and down to follow the astronaut's head movements\" correctly identifies the primary motivation for the camera's movement.\n\n**Completeness & Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   You correctly omitted details that were not present, such as speed changes, lens distortion, or shot transitions, which keeps the description concise as requested.\n*   You successfully identified and described the camera's height, angle, focus, and movement, including its purpose (tracking the subject).\n\n**Areas for Minor Refinement:**\n*   The phrase \"starting with a level angle that shifts to a low angle\" is a good description of the *effect* on the subject. However, to be even more precise about the camera's *action*, you could simply state that the camera **tilts up**. The caption already mentions tilting later, so integrating this earlier could make it slightly more streamlined.\n\n### Revised Caption for Comparison\n\nHere is a slightly revised version that incorporates the feedback for improved flow, though your original is already excellent:\n\n\"This eye-level shot uses a shallow depth of field to keep the astronaut's face in sharp focus in the midground. The camera has a minimal, organic shake and performs a slow tilt up and then down, precisely tracking the subject's head movements.\"\n\nThis version combines the observations into a more integrated description but conveys the same correct information as your original caption. Overall, your analysis was thorough and well-articulated.",
