    "pre_caption": "The video features a smooth forward-moving camera at eye level, maintaining a level angle.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an overhead level (around second floor height).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on the caption. It is clear, concise, and accurately identifies most of the key visual characteristics according to the instructions. Here is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the smooth forward movement, eye-level height, level angle, deep focus, and lack of lens distortion. The only minor inaccuracy is stating the camera \"advances along the road.\" The camera is clearly moving along the railroad tracks, which run parallel to the road.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is very complete. It successfully covers all the relevant aspects requested in the instructions, including movement, camera position (height and angle), focus, and lens properties. It correctly omits details that are not present, such as speed alterations or Dutch angles.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres perfectly to the instructions. It provides a concise yet informative description, focusing on the specified technical aspects of the shot.\n\n### Suggested Improvement\n\nTo enhance the accuracy, you could specify that the camera is moving along the railroad tracks.\n\n**Original Caption:**\n> The video features a smooth forward-moving camera at eye level, maintaining a level angle. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field, capturing the scene clearly without any lens distortion. The camera steadily advances along the road, focusing on the sunset in the distance.\n\n**Revised Caption for Greater Accuracy:**\n> This shot features a steady, forward dolly movement at eye level, advancing along a set of railroad tracks. The camera maintains a level angle and uses deep focus, keeping the entire scene from the foreground to the distant sunset sharp and clear. There is no apparent lens distortion.",
