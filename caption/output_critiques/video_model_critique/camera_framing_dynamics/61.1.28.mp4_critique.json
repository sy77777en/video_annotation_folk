    "pre_caption": "The video features a handheld camera at eye level, capturing a man in the foreground. It employs a shallow depth of field, focusing on the man's face. The camera angle is level but includes a varying Dutch angle due to rolling. The camera zooms in and out, matching the rhythm of the dance, with slight unsteadiness and some shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead). The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The handheld camera, pointed at the subject's face, zooms in and out while rolling back and forth to match the rhythm of the dance.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent analysis. The caption is good but contains a key inaccuracy regarding the camera's movement.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of your caption's performance:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is mostly accurate. It correctly identifies the shot as handheld, at eye-level, with a shallow depth of field focused on the man. The identification of a level angle combined with a varying Dutch angle from rolling is also spot on. However, the primary inaccuracy is describing the movement as \"zooms in and out.\" The camera is physically moving forward and backward (a **dolly in and out**), not changing its focal length. This is evident from the way the perspective between the subject and the background shifts.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is quite comprehensive, covering height, angle, focus, and movement characteristics like rhythm and steadiness. It successfully captures the main visual elements. It could be slightly more complete by specifying that the camera is also **tracking** the subject to keep him centered.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instruction:** The caption adheres well to the instructions for conciseness and structure. It correctly omits unnecessary details like normal video speed and lack of lens distortion. The only significant deviation is the misidentification of the camera movement type (dolly vs. zoom), which the instructions specifically ask to differentiate.\n\n### Suggested Improvement\n\nHere is a revised version of the caption that corrects the inaccuracy:\n\n**Revised Caption:**\n\"This eye-level, handheld shot tracks a man in the foreground with a shallow depth of field. The camera rhythmically dollies in and out, creating an energetic feel, while also rolling to produce a varying Dutch angle. The movement has a noticeable but controlled shake.\"",
