    "pre_caption": "The video features an aerial-level camera that starts at a level angle and transitions to a low angle. It maintains deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera steadily moves forward and downward, slightly tilting up and panning right to keep a skateboarder in frame, with some slight shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a level angle (looking straight ahead) and then changes to a low angle (looking up from below) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera focuses on a skateboarder, steadily moving forward and downward while slightly tilting up and panning right to keep them in frame.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on the caption. It is highly detailed and accurately captures most of the complex camera work in the video. Here is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **Highly Accurate:** The descriptions of the camera height (`aerial-level`), angle transition (`starts at a level angle and transitions to a low angle`), focus (`deep focus with a large depth of field`), and the primary camera movements (`moves forward and downward, slightly tilting up and panning right to keep a skateboarder in frame`) are all spot-on. You correctly identified the complex, multi-axis movement designed to track the subject.\n*   **Minor Inaccuracy:** The phrase `with some slight shaking` is incorrect. The camera movement is exceptionally smooth and steady, which is characteristic of a digital camera move in a CGI environment or a perfectly stabilized physical camera rig (like a crane or drone). There is no perceptible shake.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is very complete. It successfully covers all the relevant aspects required by the instructions:\n    *   **Camera Height & Angle:** Both are described, including the dynamic change in angle.\n    *   **Focus:** The deep focus is correctly noted.\n    *   **Movement:** The type, direction, and purpose of the movement are all clearly explained.\n    *   It correctly omits mentions of normal video speed, lack of lens distortion, and the absence of a Dutch angle, adhering to the conciseness rule.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   The caption follows the instructions perfectly in terms of structure and content, providing a concise yet informative summary of the shot's technical characteristics. The only deviation is the minor factual error regarding steadiness.\n\n### Suggested Improvement\n\nTo make the caption perfect, simply correct the description of the camera's steadiness.\n\n**Revised Caption:**\n\n\"The video features an aerial-level, steady shot that begins at a level angle and transitions to a low angle. The camera maintains deep focus with a large depth of field as it moves smoothly forward and downward, simultaneously tilting up and panning right to keep the skateboarder centered in the frame.\"",
