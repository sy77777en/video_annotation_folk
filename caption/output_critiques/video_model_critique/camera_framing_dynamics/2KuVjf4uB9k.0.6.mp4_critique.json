    "pre_caption": "The video features an overhead-level camera at a high angle, looking down from above with a varying Dutch angle due to camera rolling. It maintains deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera, mounted on a drone, smoothly tracks a racing car from an aerial view, arcing from side to side with tilting and vertical movements to enhance excitement. The motion is quick and steady, with no shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an overhead level (around second floor height).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above). The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The drone flies overhead to track the racing car, continuously arcing from one side to the other, accompanied by tilting and up-and-down movements to enhance the excitement.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tracking the subject from an aerial view.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving quickly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on identifying many of the key camera techniques. However, the caption is inaccurate and incomplete because it describes a montage of multiple shots as if it were a single, continuous shot.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of your caption's performance:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is inaccurate. It describes the entire video as being from an \"overhead-level camera... mounted on a drone.\" This is only true for some of the shots. The video is a montage that includes a very low-angle, car-mounted shot (00:00) and a low-angle tracking shot from the side (00:03), which are completely different from the aerial drone perspective.\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is incomplete. It fails to mention that the video consists of multiple distinct shots joined by hard cuts. According to the instructions, when transitions occur, each segment should be described. It also misses the prominent wide-angle lens distortion in the opening shot.\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption does not follow the instruction to \"describe the camera framing and movement in each segment separately\" in the case of shot transitions. By generalizing, it misrepresents the video's structure and variety.\n\n### Corrected Caption Example\n\nHere is a more accurate caption that adheres to the instructions by describing the video's montage structure:\n\nThe video is a fast-paced montage of a drifting car, using hard cuts between different dynamic shots at regular speed.\n\nThe opening shot is a **low-angle, car-mounted point-of-view** with **extreme wide-angle distortion**, looking backward as the car drifts. This cuts to a series of **aerial-level, high-angle drone shots** that track the car. In these shots, the camera smoothly **arcs, cranes, and rolls** (creating a dynamic Dutch angle) to follow the car's movements, maintaining a **deep focus**. Interspersed is a **low-angle shot tracking alongside the car**, where fast motion blurs the background, creating a shallower depth of field. All camera movements are quick and steady.",
