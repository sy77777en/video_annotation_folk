    "pre_caption": "The video begins with the camera at eye level, looking straight ahead. It then transitions to a low angle, looking up at the person holding a book. The camera is at a varying Dutch angle due to gentle rolling. It uses deep focus, keeping all elements sharp. The camera smoothly moves forward, slightly tilting up to focus on the person's face, with a gentle counter-clockwise roll.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a level angle (looking straight ahead) and then changes to a low angle (looking up from below) due to camera motion. The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera gradually moves forward while slightly tilting up to focus on the person's face, accompanied by gentle counter-clockwise rolling.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "The provided caption is not good. It contains significant inaccuracies regarding the shot's structure and focus, and it misinterprets the camera's continuous movement as a transition.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n\n*   **Incorrect \"Transition\":** The caption incorrectly states, \"It then transitions to a low angle.\" The video consists of a single, continuous shot with no cuts or transitions. The camera's angle changes as part of a fluid, uninterrupted movement.\n*   **Incorrect Focus Description:** The caption claims the video \"uses deep focus, keeping all elements sharp.\" This is false. The video clearly uses a **shallow depth of field**. The person is in sharp focus, but the background (the door, window, and laundry basket) is noticeably soft and blurred.\n*   **Imprecise Angle Description:** While the camera does tilt up, describing the final position as a \"low angle\" is an overstatement. It's more of a level-to-slightly-low angle. The initial description of \"looking straight ahead\" is also vague; the camera starts by framing the person's back and side.\n\n**Completeness:**\n\n*   The caption correctly identifies the forward movement, the upward tilt, and the gentle roll (Dutch angle).\n*   However, it fails to mention that the focus **tracks** the subject as the camera moves closer.\n*   It omits a description of the depth of field, instead providing an incorrect one.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   The caption attempts to address the required elements (angle, movement, focus) but fails on accuracy.\n*   The description of a non-existent \"transition\" fundamentally misrepresents the cinematography of the clip.\n*   The language is concise, but its inaccuracy makes it misleading.\n\nA more accurate and effective caption would be:\n\n\"In a single, continuous shot at normal speed, the camera starts at eye-level, framing a person from behind. It smoothly dollies forward while simultaneously tilting up and rolling slightly counter-clockwise, creating a subtle, shifting Dutch angle. The shot uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the person in the midground in sharp focus while the background remains soft.\"",
