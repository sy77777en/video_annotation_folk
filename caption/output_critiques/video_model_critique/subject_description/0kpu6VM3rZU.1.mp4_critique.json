    "pre_caption": "The video features a woman as the main subject, wearing a shiny, metallic gold dress with thin straps. She has long, straight black hair and is holding a trophy in her right hand. Her expression is animated, and she appears to be speaking into a microphone held by another woman. The secondary subject, a woman with long brown hair in an updo, is wearing a light-colored, embellished dress and is holding the microphone labeled \"ET Canada.\" In the background, several people are visible, dressed in formal attire, suggesting a red carpet event. The main focus is on the interaction between the two women, with the trophy being a notable element.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with one clear main focus**, so you need to clarify who the main subject is. The description should focus on the details of the main subject while concisely summarizing secondary subjects and describing their relationship to the main subject if clear.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your instructions, here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is mostly accurate in its description of the subjects and the setting.\n*   There is one factual error: The caption states the main subject is holding the trophy in her **right hand**, but she is clearly holding it in her **left hand** throughout the video.\n*   The description of the dress as \"shiny, metallic gold\" is a reasonable interpretation of the color, which could also be described as bronze or dark gold.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is very complete. It successfully identifies the two main subjects, their key visual attributes (clothing, hair), the significant object (trophy), their interaction (interview), and the context of the event.\n*   It effectively describes the interviewer and the microphone, including the \"ET Canada\" logo, which is a key detail.\n*   A minor detail that could be added for even greater completeness is the visible tattoo on the main subject's left shoulder, but its omission does not detract from the overall quality of the description.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is a well-written, concise, and clear paragraph.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It correctly uses precise terms (\"woman\") and distinguishes between the subjects effectively (\"main subject,\" \"secondary subject\").\n*   **Visual Attributes:** It provides specific and descriptive details about clothing, hair, and objects as instructed.\n*   **Structure and Focus:** The caption correctly focuses on the salient subjects, prioritizes the main subject, and uses the background information appropriately to provide context without being distracting. It avoids subjective emotional language, using \"animated\" to describe physical expression, which is acceptable.\n*   **Formatting:** It follows all formatting rules, providing a single paragraph without introductory text or markdown.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is very good and adheres well to the instructions. It is well-structured, descriptive, and informative. The only significant issue is the factual error regarding which hand is holding the trophy. Correcting this single detail would make the caption excellent.",
