    "pre_caption": "The video features an interior scenery shot of a minimalist, tiled room with water. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere, highlighting the serene and somewhat mysterious ambiance created by the lighting and reflections on the water. There is no main subject, as the emphasis is on the architectural space and its interaction with light and water. This type of shot could serve as an establishing shot, setting the scene by providing context and mood, or as an FPV shot, creating an immersive experience by drawing the viewer into the tranquil setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is inaccurate because it completely omits the most salient subject in the video and incorrectly claims there is no main subject. A dark, humanoid figure clearly emerges from the water towards the end of the clip. The caption also violates the instructions by including subjective adjectives like \"serene,\" \"mysterious,\" and \"tranquil,\" and by providing speculative analysis on the shot's cinematic purpose (\"establishing shot,\" \"FPV shot,\" \"immersive experience\"). The caption should be rewritten to describe the setting first—the white tiled room partially filled with dark water, with arched windows and a dark doorway—and then describe the appearance of the dark, featureless, humanoid head-and-shoulders silhouette that rises from the water in front of the doorway. All subjective and speculative language must be removed.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is an interior shot of a room with white tiled walls, partially filled with dark green water. Bright light shines through two arched windows on the left wall, creating reflections on the water. In the center of the back wall is a dark, arched doorway. A dark, featureless, humanoid silhouette of a head and shoulders slowly rises from the water in front of the doorway.",
