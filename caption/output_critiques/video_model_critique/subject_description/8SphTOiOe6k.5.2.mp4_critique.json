    "pre_caption": "The video features a bustling street scene with multiple people engaged in various activities. In the foreground, a group of schoolchildren wearing matching dark uniforms with backpacks gather near a shop entrance. Nearby, several adults walk along the street, dressed in casual attire, including jackets and sweaters. Some individuals wear face masks. The scene includes a mix of men and women, with diverse clothing styles and colors. The setting suggests a lively, public area with shops and pedestrians moving about.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects with no clear main focus**. Because it does not emphasize any specific subject, please briefly describe the types of subjects without going into too much detail. You may also describe the subjects collectively as a group.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption generally follows the instruction by identifying the main subjects as schoolchildren in matching dark uniforms with backpacks and several adults in casual attire, some wearing face masks. However, it could be improved by specifying more visual attributes for the adults, such as the colors and styles of their clothing, and by distinguishing between men and women where possible (e.g., “a man in a green hat and brown pants,” “a woman in a striped shirt and black pants”). The caption should also clarify that the schoolchildren are mostly standing together near the shop entrance, while adults are walking or standing along the street, and mention that most people are wearing face masks. The reference to a “bustling street scene” and “lively, public area” is somewhat subjective and could be replaced with a more objective description of the number of people and their activities. The mention of “shops and pedestrians moving about” is accurate, but the caption should avoid generalizations and instead focus on the specific visual details present in the video. Remove the phrase “The setting suggests” and instead directly describe what is visible. Overall, the caption should be more precise and detailed in describing the visual attributes and actions of each subject group, while avoiding subjective or inferred language.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video shows a busy street with numerous people engaged in various activities. In the foreground, a group of schoolchildren in matching dark uniforms with backpacks stands together near a shop entrance. Nearby, several adults walk or stand along the street. A man in a green hat and brown pants walks past, while a woman in a striped shirt and black pants stands by a shop window. Most individuals, including both men and women, wear face masks. The adults are dressed in casual attire, such as jackets and sweaters, in a variety of colors and styles. The scene captures a crowded area with shops and pedestrians actively moving about.",
