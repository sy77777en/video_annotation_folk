    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a woman in a maroon vest and white shirt, wearing glasses, seated at a table. She is holding an ice cream cone and appears to be enjoying it. Next to her is another woman with blonde hair, wearing a denim jacket, who is looking at her with a slight smile. The scene transitions to a man in a yellow shirt sitting at a different table, which is set with various dishes. He is facing the camera and smiling. The setting is a restaurant with ornate decor, featuring intricate patterns and a circular opening in the background. The transition between subjects occurs as the focus shifts from the women to the man, highlighting the change in interaction and setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **switching from one to another**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the transition occurs, whether through subject movement or camera movement.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "This caption is not good for the video. It fails on multiple key aspects of the instructions, primarily accuracy.\n\n### Feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is fundamentally inaccurate. It describes subjects, objects, and actions that are not present in the video.\n*   The caption begins by describing \"a woman in a maroon vest and white shirt, wearing glasses, seated at a table...holding an ice cream cone\" and \"another woman with blonde hair, wearing a denim jacket.\" Neither of these individuals is visible in the video.\n*   The man in the yellow shirt is present, but the description of him is incorrect. He is not \"facing the camera and smiling\"; he is looking toward the right side of the frame, and his expression is unclear due to the video's blurriness.\n*   The video does not contain a \"scene transition.\" It is a single, continuous, blurry shot that pans across a restaurant. The caption invents a transition from the non-existent women to the man.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is incomplete as it omits the actual subjects and focuses on fabricated ones. It fails to mention the out-of-focus person in the foreground right, the other diners in the background, or the overall blurry and shaky quality of the shot.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid describing what is not visible\":** This is the most significant failure. The majority of the description is based on subjects and details that are entirely absent from the video.\n*   **Violation of \"Describe shot transitions\":** The caption incorrectly identifies a simple camera pan as a \"scene transition\" and fabricates a narrative around this non-existent cut.\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid subjective adjectives\":** The caption uses phrases like \"appears to be enjoying it\" and \"slight smile,\" which are subjective interpretations of emotion and are based on non-existent subjects.\n*   **Inaccurate Subject Description:** While it correctly identifies a \"man in a yellow shirt,\" it fails to accurately describe his orientation and expression, which violates the instruction to describe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a work of fiction that does not describe the provided video. It fails to adhere to the core instruction of accurately describing only what is visible.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A blurry, handheld shot pans slowly from right to left across the interior of a bustling, ornately decorated Chinese restaurant. In the foreground on the right, the out-of-focus shoulder and head of a person in a white top are visible. The camera moves to reveal a man with dark skin in a yellow short-sleeved shirt sitting at a round table with a white tablecloth. In the background, other patrons are seated at various tables, and a large, golden, carved archway frames the view into another part of the restaurant. The overall image is out of focus, capturing the ambient movement and atmosphere of the dining room.",
