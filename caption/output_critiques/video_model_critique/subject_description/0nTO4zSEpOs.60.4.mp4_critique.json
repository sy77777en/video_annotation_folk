    "pre_caption": "The video features a bustling urban scene at night, with several people walking on a tiled pedestrian walkway. The individuals are dressed in dark, formal clothing, likely suits, and some are carrying bags. A few people are wearing face masks. The setting is surrounded by tall, illuminated buildings with prominent signage, contributing to a vibrant city atmosphere. The people are dispersed across the walkway, moving in various directions, suggesting a typical evening in a busy city area.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects with no clear main focus**. Because it does not emphasize any specific subject, please briefly describe the types of subjects without going into too much detail. You may also describe the subjects collectively as a group.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe caption is very good. It is accurate, well-written, and provides a clear and concise summary of the video's content. It successfully captures the essence of the scene. However, there are a few minor areas where it deviates slightly from the strict letter of the instructions.\n\n**Feedback Breakdown:**\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the setting as a nighttime urban scene, the surface as a tiled pedestrian walkway, and the subjects as people in dark, formal attire, some with bags and face masks. The description of the surrounding illuminated buildings is also correct.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is comprehensive, covering the key elements of the scene: the people, their general appearance and actions, and the environment. It correctly follows the guideline for a video with multiple subjects without a clear focus by describing them as a collective group.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Strengths:**\n        *   The caption is a single, coherent paragraph in simple, natural English.\n        *   It correctly avoids terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n        *   It identifies the subject type as \"people\" and \"individuals.\"\n        *   It describes key visual attributes like \"dark, formal clothing,\" \"carrying bags,\" and \"wearing face masks.\"\n        *   It describes the subjects' actions (\"walking,\" \"moving in various directions\").\n\n    *   **Areas for Improvement:**\n        *   **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The instructions state to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption uses \"bustling\" and \"vibrant.\" While these effectively describe the scene, they are subjective interpretations of the atmosphere. A more neutral description would focus purely on the visual facts, such as \"many people\" instead of \"bustling\" and \"brightly illuminated\" instead of \"vibrant.\"\n        *   **Inclusion of Interpretation:** The phrase \"suggesting a typical evening in a busy city area\" is an interpretation of the scene, not a direct observation. The instructions ask to \"avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\" While the interpretation is almost certainly correct, a stricter adherence would stick to describing only the observable actions: \"The people are dispersed across the walkway, moving in various directions.\"\n        *   **Describing the Background:** The instructions state, \"Don't mention the background... unless it's necessary.\" In this video, the illuminated cityscape is a dominant feature. While describing it provides essential context, a very strict interpretation of the rule might limit the description of the buildings, as the primary focus is on the people. However, in this case, its inclusion is justifiable as it defines the environment in which the subjects exist.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe caption is excellent and provides a useful and accurate description. The minor deviations from the instructions are in areas that are often a matter of judgment (e.g., how much context to provide, what constitutes a \"subjective\" adjective). To be perfectly compliant, you could revise it to be more strictly objective, but as it stands, it is a high-quality and effective caption.",
