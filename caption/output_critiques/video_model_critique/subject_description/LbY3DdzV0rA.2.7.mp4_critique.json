    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dramatic landscape scenery shot, capturing a powerful thunderstorm over a vast, open highway at dusk or night. The composition intentionally lacks a single main subject, instead focusing on the immense scale and atmospheric power of the natural event, making the environment itself the central focus. Turbulent, dark purple storm clouds dominate the sky, from which sheets of rain descend and brilliant forks of lightning strike the ground, illuminating the entire scene in flashes of pink and white. Below the storm, the horizon glows with a warm orange and pink light, while the headlights of distant cars on the parallel highways create long, glowing light trails that stretch into the heart of the tempest.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the video as a scenery shot and correctly follows the specific instruction to explain why there is no main subject. However, there are a few minor areas for improvement. The description mentions only \"headlights,\" but the light trails are clearly created by both headlights and red taillights; adding \"and taillights\" would be more accurate. The phrase \"stretch into the heart of the tempest\" is slightly poetic and could be replaced with a more direct description, such as \"stretch toward the storm.\" Additionally, the adjectives \"dramatic\" and \"powerful\" lean toward subjective interpretation. While they describe the visual intensity, replacing them with more neutral, descriptive terms like \"large-scale\" would align more strictly with the instruction to avoid subjective language.",
