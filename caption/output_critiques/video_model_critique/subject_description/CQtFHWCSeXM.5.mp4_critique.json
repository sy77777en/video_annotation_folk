There is no main subject because the camera maintains a static view of a portion of the building's facade, including an arched wooden door, a black wrought iron fence with fleur-de-lis finials, and a green bush with red flowers. The emphasis is on the overall texture, design elements, and the interplay of the built environment with the small patch of nature, rather than highlighting a specific, singular object or action.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text.",

It fails to mention the black, lantern-style light fixture mounted on the brick wall above the arched doorway. It also leaves out the tall, narrow, arched window to the right of the door and the rectangular window with white trim visible in the upper right corner of the scene. To improve accuracy and detail, these elements should be included in the description of the building.",

There is no main subject, as the camera maintains a static view of a portion of the building's facade. The shot features a rounded, arched wooden door, above which is a black, lantern-style light fixture. To the right of the door is a tall, narrow, arched window, and a rectangular window with white trim is visible in the upper right corner. In the foreground, a black wrought iron fence with fleur-de-lis finials and a green bush with red flowers are also prominent.
