    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a man standing upright, partially illuminated by a strong beam of light. He is dressed in dark, heavy clothing that appears rugged and practical, with visible straps and armor-like elements, suggesting protective gear. His face is mostly obscured by shadows, but his posture is alert and tense. The scene then transitions to another man, who is crouched low to the ground. This second man also wears dark, protective clothing with metallic or leather components, and his body language indicates caution or readiness, as he appears to be bracing himself or preparing to move. The switch between subjects occurs through a shift in focus, moving from the standing man to the crouched man, both of whom share similar attire and a sense of preparedness, but are distinguished by their poses and the way they are lit.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **switching from one to another**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the transition occurs, whether through subject movement or camera movement.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains several inaccuracies and subjective interpretations that are not supported by the video evidence and violate the instructions. The descriptions of the subjects' clothing—\"dark, heavy clothing that appears rugged and practical, with visible straps and armor-like elements\" and \"dark, protective clothing with metallic or leather components\"—are overly detailed and speculative, as these specific attributes are not clearly visible in the dark and shadowy footage. The instruction to \"avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about\" has not been followed. Furthermore, the caption uses subjective terms like \"alert and tense,\" \"caution or readiness,\" and \"sense of preparedness,\" which convey emotions and interpretations of body language, directly contradicting the instruction to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The transition between subjects is misidentified as a \"shift in focus\" when it is actually a camera movement across the scene. To improve, the caption should remove the speculative details about the clothing, replacing them with more general, observable descriptions like \"dark, textured gear.\" All subjective language describing the figures' mental or emotional states should be deleted. Finally, the transition should be accurately described as a camera movement that reveals the second figure.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens in a dark, rocky environment where a horizontal beam of light cuts across the scene from the left. A figure stands partially illuminated, wearing dark, textured gear, with most of their form obscured by shadow. The camera then moves to the right across the uneven ground, revealing a second figure crouched low. This individual is also wearing dark gear and is mostly in shadow, with some light reflecting off their form and the ground around them.",
