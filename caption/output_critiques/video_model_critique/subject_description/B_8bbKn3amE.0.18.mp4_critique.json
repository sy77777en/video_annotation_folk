    "pre_caption": "This is an aerial scenery shot that plunges the viewer through the dramatic landscape of a massive glacier. The camera navigates at high speed through a deep, narrow crevasse, flanked by towering walls of jagged, fractured ice and compacted snow. The ice within the chasm reveals a pale blue tint, contrasting with the bright white snow on the upper surfaces and the dark, rocky mountain face that borders the glacier under an overcast sky. There is no main subject in this video; the focus is entirely on conveying the immense scale, raw texture, and imposing atmosphere of the glacial environment. The rapid movement and close proximity to the ice formations emphasize the vastness and intricate details of the natural wonder rather than a specific focal point.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on this caption. It is highly descriptive and captures the essence of the video well. Here is a detailed breakdown of your caption based on the provided instructions.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the scene as an aerial shot of a massive glacier, the specific action of flying through a crevasse, and the key visual elements like the jagged, fractured ice, compacted snow, the pale blue tint of the ice, the dark rocky mountain, and the overcast sky. The description of the high-speed movement is also spot-on.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe description is very complete. It covers all the significant aspects of the video, from the large-scale environment (glacier, mountain) to the fine details (texture of the ice, color variations). It successfully conveys the dynamic nature of the shot and the scale of the landscape.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Scenery Shot Protocol:** You correctly identified this as a scenery shot without a main subject and followed the specific instruction to explain why the focus is on the environment, scale, and atmosphere. The explanation is clear and well-integrated.\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The paragraph is well-structured, coherent, and uses clear, natural English. It effectively combines details from the entire video into a single narrative.\n*   **Descriptive Language:** The use of descriptive language like \"jagged, fractured ice,\" \"compacted snow,\" and \"pale blue tint\" is excellent and adheres to the instruction to describe key visual attributes.\n*   **Avoidance of Subjective Adjectives:** This is the main area for improvement. The instructions state, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption uses several:\n    *   \"**dramatic** landscape\"\n    *   \"**imposing** atmosphere\"\n    *   \"natural **wonder**\" (This is an evaluative phrase rather than a purely descriptive one.)\n    While these words are fitting, they violate the rule against subjectivity. The goal is to describe what is seen, allowing the reader to infer the drama or imposition.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is very good but could be perfected by removing the subjective and emotional adjectives to fully comply with the instructions. It excels in accuracy, completeness, and structure.\n\n**Final Verdict:** The caption is good, but not perfect, due to the use of subjective adjectives which were explicitly forbidden in the instructions.",
