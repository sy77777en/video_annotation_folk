    "pre_caption": "The video features a person engaged in construction work. The individual, whose skin tone is medium, is wearing a light-colored hat and a patterned garment. They are holding bricks, one in each hand, with visible text imprinted on one of the bricks. The scene includes a partially constructed brick wall and a container with cement. The person appears to be standing on a concrete surface, possibly a staircase, with scattered bricks and construction materials around them. The setting suggests an outdoor environment with some greenery visible nearby.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "This is excellent feedback. Here is a detailed breakdown of the caption's performance based on your instructions:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe caption is good. It successfully identifies the main subject, their action, and the key objects in the scene, providing a clear and concise overview. It adheres to most of the structural and stylistic rules. However, it contains one significant factual error and could be improved with more specific visual details.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **High Accuracy:** The description of the activity (\"construction work\"), the objects (\"bricks,\" \"partially constructed brick wall,\" \"container with cement,\" \"scattered bricks\"), and the setting (\"concrete surface,\" \"outdoor environment with some greenery\") is accurate.\n*   **Major Inaccuracy:** The caption incorrectly states the person is wearing a \"light-colored hat.\" The video is shot from a first-person perspective, and the light-colored object is the top of the person's shirt or tunic, not a hat. This is a critical misinterpretation of the visual information.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is reasonably complete, covering the most salient elements.\n*   **Areas for Improvement:** It could be more descriptive by including more specific details that are clearly visible. For example:\n    *   The color of the bricks (red or terracotta).\n    *   The color of the container holding the cement (a green plastic basin).\n    *   The orange handle of a trowel sticking out of the cement.\n    *   The specific colors in the patterned garment (e.g., dark purple with yellow/white patterns).\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is a well-structured, single paragraph written in simple, natural English. It is both concise and informative.\n*   **Subject Focus:** It correctly focuses on the primary subject (the person) and related objects, as instructed.\n*   **Avoiding Speculation:** The use of \"appears to be\" and \"possibly a staircase\" is excellent, correctly reflecting uncertainty without making definitive claims about what isn't fully visible.\n*   **Visual Attributes:** The description of the person's skin tone and the patterned garment is good. However, the \"hat\" error and the lack of color details for objects show a slight weakness in providing a comprehensive description of key visual attributes.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** The caption successfully avoids terms like \"image,\" \"frame,\" or subjective emotional language.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe caption is effective but flawed. Its primary weakness is the factual error regarding the hat. By correcting this and adding a few more specific color and object details, it would become an excellent and fully compliant description.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a first-person perspective, a person with a medium skin tone is engaged in construction work. They are wearing a light-colored shirt and a dark purple patterned garment around their waist. The person holds a red brick in each hand, with text visible on one of them. The scene includes a partially constructed brick wall and a green plastic basin containing wet cement, from which an orange trowel handle protrudes. Broken brick pieces are scattered on the concrete surface, possibly a staircase, where the person is standing. The outdoor setting features green foliage and rocks below.",
