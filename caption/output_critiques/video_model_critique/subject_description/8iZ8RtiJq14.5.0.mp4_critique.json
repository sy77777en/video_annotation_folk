    "pre_caption": "A humanoid figure with a smooth, reflective, silver head devoid of any facial features is shown from the chest up. The figure wears a light blue, collared button-down shirt and a light gray tie. Its hands, which are also silver and metallic, are held up with the palms facing upward in a presentational gesture. To the right, the back of a second figure's head and shoulder is partially visible, appearing as a dark, indistinct shape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption is excellent and meets all the requirements of the instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe description is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the main subject as a \"humanoid figure\" with a \"smooth, reflective, silver head devoid of any facial features.\" The clothing (\"light blue, collared button-down shirt and a light gray tie\") and the appearance and pose of the hands (\"silver and metallic, are held up with the palms facing upward\") are all described precisely. The description of the second, partially visible figure is also accurate.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete, capturing all the salient visual information. It details the material, color, and lack of features on the main figure's head, describes its clothing and pose, and notes the presence and appearance of the secondary figure. No key visual elements of the subjects have been omitted.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption perfectly adheres to the provided guidelines:\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** It is a single, well-written paragraph that is both concise and informative.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It uses a precise term (\"humanoid figure\") and distinguishes between the two subjects clearly.\n*   **Visual Attributes:** It provides specific details about color, material, clothing, and pose.\n*   **Objectivity:** It avoids subjective or emotional language, using descriptive terms like \"reflective\" and \"indistinct.\"\n*   **Formatting:** It follows all formatting rules, such as avoiding markdown, introductory text, and forbidden words like \"image.\"\n*   **Focus:** It correctly focuses on the subjects and their attributes, as instructed.\n*   **Prioritization:** It logically describes the central, primary subject first before mentioning the secondary, partially obscured one.\n\nIn summary, this is a model caption that effectively and accurately describes the video content while strictly following all given instructions.",
