    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the video as an interior scenery shot and explains that the focus is on the environment. However, it is too general and lacks the specific visual details required by the instructions. It also includes an interpretive statement that should be removed. The final sentence, \"This type of shot could serve as an establishing shot, setting the scene and providing context for the viewer,\" speculates on the shot's cinematic purpose rather than describing its visual content and should be deleted. To improve, the caption should incorporate specific descriptions of the architectural elements shown, such as the small, white square tiles covering the walls and stairs, the rectangular doorway, the larger room with two-toned walls, the circular ceiling light, and the prominent black-and-white square pattern on the floor. This will provide a more accurate and informative description of the specific scenery.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This interior scenery shot begins in a narrow space where the walls and a short flight of stairs are covered in small, white square tiles. The camera moves forward up the stairs and through a rectangular doorway into a larger room. This room has two-toned walls, white on top and dark brown or black on the bottom. The ceiling features a large, circular light fixture and several smaller recessed lights. The tiled floor has a prominent design of a large black square with a smaller white square at its center.",
