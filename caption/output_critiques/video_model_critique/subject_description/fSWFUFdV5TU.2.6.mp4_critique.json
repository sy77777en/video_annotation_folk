    "pre_caption": "This is an interior scenery shot depicting a dimly lit apartment entryway at night. A dark wooden door stands slightly ajar in the center of the frame, with a bright sliver of light peeking out from the bottom. To the left, a warm glow emanates from a lamp with a white shade resting on a wooden console table, which also holds a few framed photographs. To the right of the door, a low shoe rack sits beneath a large framed piece of art, and the silhouette of a houseplant is visible in the corner. The shot lacks a main subject, as the focus is on the quiet, atmospheric environment. The moody, low-key lighting and static composition emphasize the setting itself, creating a sense of stillness and anticipation.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly includes the final sentence, \"The moody, low-key lighting and static composition emphasize the setting itself, creating a sense of stillness and anticipation,\" which violates the instruction to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The words \"moody\" and the phrase \"creating a sense of stillness and anticipation\" are interpretive and should be removed. Additionally, the caption omits a few visible subjects. It fails to mention the dark coat rack standing on the far left of the scene and the pair of white sneakers sitting on the low shoe rack. These details should be added to provide a more complete description of the visible subjects.",

A dark wooden door stands slightly ajar in the center of the frame, with a bright sliver of light peeking out from the bottom. To the far left, a dark coat rack is visible. Next to it, a warm glow emanates from a lamp with a white shade resting on a wooden console table, which also holds a few framed photographs. To the right of the door, a low shoe rack holding a pair of white sneakers sits beneath a large framed piece of art, and the silhouette of a houseplant is visible in the corner. The shot is a static composition with low-key lighting that focuses on the setting itself.",
