    "pre_caption": "The video is a rural landscape scenery shot, capturing a quiet, sunlit country road that gently curves through a verdant area under a vast, partly cloudy sky. The scene features lush greenery along the roadside, a few scattered houses with red roofs, and a tranquil atmosphere enhanced by the expansive blue sky filled with billowing white clouds. The focus is on the environment and the sense of open space, emphasizing the peacefulness and scale of the rural setting rather than highlighting any specific object or individual, which is why there is no main subject in the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is mostly accurate in describing the video as a rural landscape scenery shot with a focus on the environment, greenery, a country road, and a partly cloudy sky, and it correctly explains the absence of a main subject. However, it omits the presence of a black car that appears and drives through the scene, which is a salient subject and should be mentioned with its key visual attributes and action. The caption should be revised to include the black car, describing its color, type, and movement along the road, as this is an important detail visible in the video and required by the instruction. The rest of the caption is clear and concise, but the omission of the car is a significant oversight that needs correction.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video is a rural landscape scenery shot, capturing a quiet, sunlit country road that gently curves through a verdant area under a vast, partly cloudy sky. The scene features lush greenery along the roadside, a few scattered houses with red roofs, and a tranquil atmosphere enhanced by the expansive blue sky filled with billowing white clouds. A black car, a key visual element, appears and drives smoothly along the road, adding a dynamic aspect to the otherwise serene setting. The focus remains on the environment and the sense of open space, emphasizing the peacefulness and scale of the rural setting, with the car providing a subtle yet important point of interest.",
