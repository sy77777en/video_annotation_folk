    "pre_caption": "The video features a woman with long, straight hair, partially visible on the left side. She is wearing a light-colored garment. The lighting is dim, with a bright light source behind her, creating a silhouette effect. The focus is on her face, suggesting the use of face tracking and projection mapping technology, as indicated by the text overlay. The setting appears to be a studio environment, with equipment visible in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is mostly accurate in its description of the visible elements. It correctly identifies a person with long hair in a light-colored garment, the dim lighting, and the silhouette effect.\n*   However, there is a significant inaccuracy: \"The focus is on her face...\". The woman's face is not visible at all; we only see the back of her head and her left shoulder. The caption incorrectly describes an element that is not present, likely inferring it from the text overlay.\n*   The statement \"The setting appears to be a studio environment\" is a reasonable and likely correct inference based on the visible equipment and lighting.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is not fully complete. While it mentions the text overlay indirectly (\"as indicated by the text overlay\"), it fails to describe the text itself, which is a prominent visual element. A complete description would include the words \"OMOTE REAL-TIME FACE TRACKING & PROJECTION MAPPING\" that are clearly displayed.\n*   The description of the lighting could be more precise. It mentions \"a bright light source,\" but there are two distinct, bright, circular lights visible in the background.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid describing what is not visible\":** The primary failure is the statement \"The focus is on her face.\" This directly contradicts the rule to avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. The caption speculates on the subject of the technology rather than describing the visual content of the scene.\n*   **Partial Adherence to \"Precise subject types\":** The caption identifies the subject as a \"woman.\" While this is a likely assumption based on the hair and build, the instructions state, \"If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\" The caption asserts the gender without acknowledging the ambiguity. A more compliant description might use \"a person, likely a woman,\" or simply \"a person with long hair.\"\n*   **Partial Adherence to \"Describe key visual attributes\":** The caption fails to describe a key visual attribute of the scene: the large white text overlay. This text is a central subject and should be described as per the instructions.\n*   **Good Adherence:** The caption successfully follows other instructions, such as being a single paragraph, using natural English, and avoiding terms like \"image\" or frame-specific references.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe caption attempts to be informative by connecting the visual to the technology mentioned in the text, but in doing so, it violates the core instruction to describe only what is visible. The most significant error is describing the woman's face, which is not shown. To improve, the caption should remove the inaccurate statement about the face and instead describe the prominent text overlay that is actually visible.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a side-on view, the back of a person with long, dark hair is visible on the left side of the frame, wearing a light-colored garment. The setting is dark and appears to be a studio, with indistinct equipment and two bright, circular lights glowing in the background. Overlaid in the foreground is large white text that reads \"OMOTE,\" with the smaller text \"REAL-TIME FACE TRACKING & PROJECTION MAPPING\" positioned underneath.",
