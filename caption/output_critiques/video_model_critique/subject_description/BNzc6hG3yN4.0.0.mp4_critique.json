    "pre_caption": "A group of young men are positioned on and around a teal sedan. A man in the center wears a black varsity jacket with white details, a black baseball cap, and a black face mask covering his lower face. To his left, two men sit on the car's trunk, both wearing black hooded sweatshirts; one has a thin mustache and goatee. A Black man with short hair, wearing a grey t-shirt and blue jeans, sits on the roof of the car. Another person with long dark hair and a black cap stands by the open rear door, while someone wearing a black hoodie and white and yellow sneakers is seated inside the car. The men are all dressed in dark, casual clothing.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption omits the second half of the video, which begins after a hard cut to a high-angle, top-down shot. The instructions state that when shot transitions occur, the new segment must be described. The caption should be updated to include a description of this second scene, where the same group of men are rearranged around the car, with several lying on the pavement. There are also factual inaccuracies in the description of the first scene: the sedan is dark green or teal, not black. The man described as wearing a \"hood\" is wearing a black beanie. Lastly, the description \"is lighting a cigarette\" is an assumption; it should be rephrased to describe only what is visible, such as \"is holding a lighter near his mouth.\"",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A group of young men are positioned on and around a dark teal sedan in an urban setting with large apartment buildings in the background. A man in the center wears a black varsity jacket, a black baseball cap, and a black face mask. To his left, two men sit on the car's trunk; one wears a black beanie and holds a small object to his mouth, while the other wears a black hooded sweatshirt with the hood up. A Black man in a grey t-shirt and jeans sits on the car's roof. Another person with long dark hair and a black cap stands by the open rear door, while someone in a black hoodie is seated in the car's open doorway. The shot then cuts to a high-angle, top-down view of the same scene. The men are now rearranged, with several lying on the pavement around the car. The man in the grey t-shirt leans back on the roof, and others are gathered near the hood and sides of the vehicle.",
