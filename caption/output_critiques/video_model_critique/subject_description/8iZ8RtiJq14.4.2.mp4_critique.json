    "pre_caption": "A humanoid figure with a silver, featureless head and silver forearms sits hunched in a black office chair, typing on a vintage beige keyboard at a desk. This figure wears a tan, short-sleeved collared shirt and dark pants with a brown belt. Standing directly behind it is a second humanoid figure, similarly styled with a silver head and arms, wearing a tan, short-sleeved shirt with chest pockets, a brown belt, and dark pants, looking down at the seated figure. A third humanoid figure, wearing a light blue, long-sleeved collared shirt and dark pants, enters from the left and stands beside the second figure, also looking down toward the desk. All three figures have the same metallic, featureless heads.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on this caption. It is a perfect example of how to follow the provided instructions, resulting in a clear, accurate, and comprehensive description.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is perfectly accurate. It correctly identifies all three subjects as \"humanoid figures\" and precisely describes their distinct clothing (tan shirt, tan shirt with pockets, blue shirt), shared features (silver, featureless heads; silver arms), and specific actions (typing, watching, entering and watching). The description of the environment, including the \"vintage beige keyboard,\" is also spot-on.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is exceptionally complete. It captures not only the static elements of the scene but also the dynamic action of the third figure entering from the left. It provides enough detail to distinguish each figure clearly while also noting their similarities. Every important visual element in the video is accounted for.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres flawlessly to all instructions:\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It balances detail with brevity, providing a rich description in a single, well-structured paragraph.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It uses the precise term \"humanoid figure\" and distinguishes each one effectively using clothing, location, and action.\n*   **Visual Attributes:** Details like clothing style (collared, short-sleeved, long-sleeved), colors, and the metallic, featureless nature of the heads are described perfectly.\n*   **No Speculation or Subjectivity:** The language is objective and descriptive, avoiding any interpretation of emotion or intent.\n*   **Structure and Flow:** The description follows a logical order, starting with the central figure and expanding to include the others as they become relevant to the scene's composition and action. It correctly describes the entrance of the third figure as a continuous part of the scene.\n\nThis caption is an exemplary model of the required output. There are no necessary corrections or improvements.",
