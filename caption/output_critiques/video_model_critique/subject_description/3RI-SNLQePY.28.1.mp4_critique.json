    "pre_caption": "A stylized, animated character with a detached head is depicted sitting at a table. The character's head is a brown, bird-like mask resembling that of a plague doctor, complete with two small antlers, and it floats just above the neck of a body wearing a teal collared shirt. The character's visible arm is dark and segmented, holding a white bowl. A thought bubble appears next to the character's head, containing a symbol that looks like a runic character with a diagonal slash through it. Above the character is a long, light-colored shelf supported by several brown legs, which displays a row of five simple drawings: a tooth, a crescent moon, a crab, two biscuits, and an acorn. A white arrow cursor moves across the screen, interacting with the symbols on the shelf. At the bottom of the scene is a reddish-brown bar containing several icons, including a stack of books with a backpack and a central swirling symbol.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

The five brown objects do not appear to be legs, and it does not seem to be a shelf. Instead, it appears to be a white rectangular machine that dispenses objects selected by the cursor. The five brown objects at the bottom of this machine could be nozzles, as objects fall out of them. It is unclear if these nozzles are supporting the machine, so please remove the detail about the nozzles supporting the machine.  \n5. The symbol at the bottom is not a stack of books, but rather appears to be a cluster of buildings.  \n6. The last sentence introduces the reddish brown bar, but we had already mentioned it since the character was sitting behind it. Reword it so it is not a new introduction of the bar. \n7. It is not a crab, but more likely a spider, as we can count eight legs.",
