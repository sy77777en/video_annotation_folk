    "pre_caption": "This video presents a sweeping aerial cityscape, capturing a dense urban environment under a hazy, overcast sky. In the foreground, a rectangular green park with concentric circular paths is symmetrically framed by rows of buildings. At the head of the park stands a large, white, multi-spired cathedral, which acts as a central architectural feature. From this point, a grid of streets lined with historic-looking buildings with dark roofs extends far into the foggy distance, blending with more modern high-rises on the horizon. The video lacks a main subject, as the camera's high and wide perspective emphasizes the vastness of the urban landscape and the moody, atmospheric conditions rather than singling out a specific entity. The focus is on the grand scale and architectural character of the location itself.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is overly long and contains some redundant phrasing. The introductory phrase \"This video presents\" should be removed to make the description more direct. The clause \"which acts as a central architectural feature\" is redundant, as the cathedral's central role is already implied by its description and location, and should be deleted. The final two sentences explaining the lack of a main subject are verbose and can be condensed into a single, more efficient sentence. For example: \"Lacking a main subject, the camera's high and wide perspective emphasizes the vastness of the urban landscape, its architectural character, and the atmospheric conditions.\" Lastly, the word \"moody\" is subjective and should be removed.",
