    "pre_caption": "The video features a bustling street scene outside a shop with several people and bicycles. A woman with long, light brown hair, wearing a tan jacket and black shorts, is walking past the shop. Another woman with long, dark hair, dressed in a white outfit, stands nearby, facing the shop window. A man in a black sweater and dark pants is seen walking away from the shop, while another man in a white shirt is visible in the background. Several bicycles are parked along the shop's exterior, which is adorned with traditional lanterns and signs. The scene captures a lively and casual atmosphere with people engaged in everyday activities.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects with no clear main focus**. Because it does not emphasize any specific subject, please briefly describe the types of subjects without going into too much detail. You may also describe the subjects collectively as a group.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\nThe caption is a good attempt at describing the scene, but it has several issues regarding accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the specific instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **Partially Inaccurate:** The caption states the woman in the white outfit \"stands nearby,\" but she is clearly walking, similar to the woman in the tan jacket.\n*   **Inaccurate:** The description of \"another man in a white shirt is visible in the background\" is incorrect. This man is in the foreground/midground, walking alongside the man in the black shirt. He is not a background figure.\n*   **Slightly Imprecise:** The term \"sweater\" for the man in black is not entirely accurate; it appears to be a long-sleeved shirt. While a minor point, more precise language is preferred. The use of \"several bicycles\" for two bicycles is a slight exaggeration.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption misses key visual details that are clearly visible and help identify the subjects. For instance, it fails to mention that the two women are wearing light-colored face masks.\n*   It omits the very prominent black Playboy bunny logo on the back of the white shirt worn by one of the men, which is a key distinguishing feature.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violation of \"No subjective adjectives\":** The caption violates the instruction to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" Words and phrases like \"bustling,\" \"lively,\" and \"casual atmosphere\" are interpretations of the scene's mood, not objective descriptions of the subjects.\n*   **Violation of \"Focus on subjects\":** The final sentence, \"The scene captures a lively and casual atmosphere with people engaged in everyday activities,\" does not describe the subjects themselves but rather offers a summary and interpretation of the overall scene, which goes against the core instructions.\n*   **Clarity in Subject Location:** The instruction to distinguish subjects by location was not followed correctly, as evidenced by the misplacement of the man in the white shirt into the \"background.\"\n\n### Summary\n\nThe caption successfully identifies the main types of subjects (people, bicycles) and provides some correct visual attributes. However, it fails on key instructions by including subjective/interpretive language, containing factual inaccuracies about the subjects' actions and locations, and omitting prominent, objective details like face masks and logos. A better caption would focus strictly on objective descriptions, correct the inaccuracies, and include the missing details.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a street scene in front of a shop, two men are walking away from the camera on the left. One man wears a white long-sleeved shirt with a black Playboy bunny logo on the back and black pants. The man next to him wears a black long-sleeved shirt and black pants. On the right side of the frame, a woman with long, light brown hair is walking toward the right. She wears a light-colored face mask, a tan jacket, a white top, and black shorts. To her right, another woman with long, dark hair, wearing a light-colored face mask and a white outfit with a black belt, is also walking toward the right. Two white bicycles are parked in front of the shop, which is decorated with paper lanterns.",
