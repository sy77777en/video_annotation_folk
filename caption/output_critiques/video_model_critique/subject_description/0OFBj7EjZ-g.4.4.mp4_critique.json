    "pre_caption": "The video features a dynamic scene with numerous wooden pallets arranged in a grid-like pattern on a flat surface. The main focus is a large, abstract, metallic structure resembling a bird in flight, positioned prominently above the pallets. This structure has smooth, reflective surfaces and sharp, angular edges, giving it a futuristic appearance. The pallets are uniformly spaced and have a natural wood texture, contrasting with the sleek metallic form. The relationship between the pallets and the metallic structure suggests a juxtaposition of natural and industrial elements, with the structure appearing to soar above the static arrangement of pallets.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with one clear main focus**, so you need to clarify who the main subject is. The description should focus on the details of the main subject while concisely summarizing secondary subjects and describing their relationship to the main subject if clear.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly identifies the material of the shards and their state. The description states they are \"metallic\" with \"reflective surfaces,\" but in the video, they are a light grey, matte material resembling broken plaster or concrete, not metal. The caption also claims the \"metallic structures\" are \"resting atop the static pallets,\" which is inaccurate; many shards are scattered on the floor between the pallets, and a prominent one is hovering or falling. Furthermore, the sentence \"The arrangement highlights a juxtaposition of natural and industrial elements\" is an interpretation rather than a direct visual description and should be removed. The term \"metallic component\" should be replaced with a more accurate description, such as \"light grey, jagged shards.\"",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video presents a scene in a large, dark space where numerous wooden pallets are arranged in a grid-like pattern on the floor. Light grey, jagged shards with a matte texture, similar in appearance to broken plaster or concrete, are scattered across the floor and between the pallets. One prominent, large shard is suspended in mid-air, seemingly hovering or falling. The pallets are uniformly spaced and display a natural wood texture, while the shards are characterized by their sharp, angular edges.",
