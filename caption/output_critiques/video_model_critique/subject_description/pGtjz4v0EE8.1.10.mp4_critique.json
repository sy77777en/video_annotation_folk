    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide-angle, time-lapse cityscape scenery shot centered on a magnificent cathedral square. The primary structure is an immense Gothic cathedral with an incredibly ornate facade made of white and dark-striped marble, featuring three large arched portals, numerous sculptures, and spires reaching toward the sky. A large, circular stained-glass rose window sits prominently above the central entrance, and a tall, striped bell tower becomes visible as the camera pulls back. The sky is a brilliant blue, filled with fluffy white clouds that drift rapidly across the frame, while people move as blurs across the expansive stone plaza. There is no single main subject, as the fisheye perspective and time-lapse technique are used to capture the overwhelming scale and dynamic atmosphere of the entire architectural ensemble. The focus is on the grandeur of the environment and the passage of time within it, rather than on any specific object or person.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains several subjective adjectives that should be removed, such as \"magnificent,\" \"incredibly ornate,\" \"brilliant,\" \"overwhelming,\" \"dynamic,\" and \"grandeur.\" The instruction requires avoiding adjectives that convey emotion. Additionally, the description of the window as \"mirrored\" is inaccurate; it is a large, round, blue-tinted stained-glass window. Finally, the last two sentences are redundant as they both explain the lack of a main subject. They should be combined into a single, more concise statement to adhere to the instruction to \"briefly explain why there is no main subject... using one to three sentences.\"",
