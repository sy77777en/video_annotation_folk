    "pre_caption": "The video features a woman with long brown hair tied in a ponytail, wearing a white shirt and a blue backpack. She is the main subject, seen from behind as she walks through a busy restaurant. The setting includes several tables with people dining. Among the secondary subjects, a man in a beige shirt is notable, sitting at a table and gesturing with his hand. Other diners are engaged in conversation and eating, contributing to a lively atmosphere. The woman appears to be moving towards a specific table, suggesting she is either joining the group or interacting with them. The restaurant's interior is warmly lit, with decorative wooden panels and a bustling ambiance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with one clear main focus**, so you need to clarify who the main subject is. The description should focus on the details of the main subject while concisely summarizing secondary subjects and describing their relationship to the main subject if clear.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "This is excellent feedback. Here is a detailed breakdown of the caption's performance based on the instructions provided.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the main subject as a woman with a ponytail, wearing a white shirt and a blue backpack/vest, seen from behind. It also accurately describes the setting as a busy restaurant and correctly points out a secondary subject—a man in a beige shirt. The description of the restaurant's interior (warmly lit, wooden panels) is also correct.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe description is very complete. It covers the primary subject, the general environment, and a specific secondary subject, providing a good overview of the scene's content and action. It successfully captures the most salient visual information in the video.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption adheres to most of the instructions well, but there are a few key areas for improvement.\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   The caption is a single, coherent paragraph.\n    *   It correctly prioritizes the main subject before moving to secondary subjects and the setting.\n    *   It uses precise terms like \"woman\" and \"man\" and provides detailed visual attributes (hair, clothing).\n    *   It avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   It describes the video as a continuous scene rather than frame-by-frame.\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   **Avoids Speculation:** The instruction states, \"You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\" The sentence, \"...suggesting she is either joining the group or interacting with them,\" violates this rule. This is an interpretation of the woman's intent, not a description of a visible action. A better approach would be to simply state that she is walking toward a table of diners.\n    *   **Avoids Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction asks to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" Words like \"lively\" and \"bustling\" can be interpreted as subjective descriptions of the atmosphere. While they describe the high level of activity, a more objective word like \"busy\" or \"crowded\" would be a safer choice. Similarly, \"notable\" is a subjective judgment; it's better to identify the subject by his location (e.g., \"a man in a beige shirt sits at a table on the left\").\n\n### Summary\n\nThe caption is very good but could be perfected by removing speculative language about the subject's intentions and replacing subjective adjectives with more objective, descriptive terms. By focusing strictly on what is visually present, the caption would fully align with all the provided instructions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features a woman with long brown hair tied in a ponytail, wearing a white shirt and a blue vest. She is the main subject, seen from behind as she walks through a busy restaurant. The setting includes several tables with people dining. At a table on the left, a man in a yellow shirt sits and gestures with his hand. Other diners are engaged in conversation and eating as waiters move through the room. The woman walks between the tables toward the back of the restaurant. The interior is lit with warm-toned lights and features decorative wooden panels and ceiling fixtures.",
