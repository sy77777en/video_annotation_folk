    "pre_caption": "The video is a landscape scenery shot. It captures a serene winter environment with snow-covered trees, rustic wooden buildings, and majestic mountains in the background. The focus is on the overall atmosphere and scale of the natural setting rather than any specific object. The snow blankets the ground and trees, creating a tranquil and cohesive scene that emphasizes the beauty and vastness of the landscape. The presence of the mountains adds depth and grandeur, while the buildings blend into the environment, enhancing the sense of harmony with nature.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is mostly accurate and follows the instruction well by focusing on the landscape and not mentioning any specific frame or unnecessary background details. However, it could be improved by specifying that there are two dark wooden buildings with white trim, a wooden swing set, and a snow-covered bench visible in the scene, which are all salient features. The caption should also clarify that the trees are tall evergreens and leafless deciduous trees, both heavily covered in snow, and that the mountains are steep and rocky with a snow-capped peak. The phrase \"rustic wooden buildings\" is appropriate, but the caption should mention the swing set and bench as notable objects that add to the sceneâ€™s detail. The description of the atmosphere and scale is good, but the sentence \"The presence of the mountains adds depth and grandeur, while the buildings blend into the environment, enhancing the sense of harmony with nature\" is somewhat subjective and could be shortened to focus on visual attributes. Suggested revision: \"The video is a landscape scenery shot showing a serene winter environment with tall snow-covered evergreen and leafless trees, two dark wooden buildings with white trim, a wooden swing set, and a snow-covered bench, all set before steep, rocky, snow-capped mountains. The focus is on the overall environment and scale, with no single main subject, as the scene highlights the natural setting and the way the buildings and objects are integrated into the snowy landscape.\"",
