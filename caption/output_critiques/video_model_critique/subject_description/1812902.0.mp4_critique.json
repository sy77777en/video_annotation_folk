    "pre_caption": "The video is a seascape scenery shot. It captures an expansive view of the ocean surrounding a large, fortress-like structure perched on a rocky outcrop. The focus is on the vastness of the sea and the imposing architecture, emphasizing the interaction between the natural and built environments. The water's deep blue contrasts with the structure's earthy tones, highlighting the scale and atmosphere rather than a specific object. The scene conveys a sense of isolation and grandeur, with the ocean's expanse and the fortress's detailed design as key visual elements.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption generally follows the instruction by identifying the video as a seascape scenery shot and describing the main visual elements: the ocean and a large, fortress-like structure on a rocky outcrop. It correctly notes that the focus is on the environment and scale rather than a specific object. However, the caption could be improved by omitting subjective language such as \"conveys a sense of isolation and grandeur,\" which is not permitted by the instruction. Additionally, the mention of \"the fortress's detailed design\" is vague and could be replaced with more specific visual attributes, such as the structure's color, shape, and notable features (e.g., rectangular form, earthy stone walls, red-tiled roofs, and visible windows). The reference to the \"interaction between the natural and built environments\" is somewhat interpretive and could be omitted for conciseness. The caption should also briefly mention the presence of small boats in the water, as these are visible and relevant to the scene. To improve, remove subjective and interpretive phrases, add specific details about the fortress's appearance, and mention the boats.",
