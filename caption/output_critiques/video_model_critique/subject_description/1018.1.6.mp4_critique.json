    "pre_caption": "The video reveals a scene inside a narrow, green train corridor. Initially, a man in a green uniform with a cap is seen walking towards the camera. He has a mustache and carries a large, brown animal, possibly a dog, in his arms. Following him is another man wearing a white shirt and a red hat, holding a small, white dog. The corridor's design features a patterned floor and windows on the right side, contributing to the setting's vintage train ambiance. The subjects are revealed as they move closer to the camera, emphasizing their uniforms and the animals they carry.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the subject is revealed through either subject movement or camera movement.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "This caption is not good for the video.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly inaccurate. It correctly identifies the setting as a green train corridor and notes some clothing details (green uniform, red hat). However, it makes significant factual errors in describing the main subjects' actions and the objects they carry.\n*   The first man is not carrying a \"large, brown animal, possibly a dog.\" He is carrying a large, green, bushy object, which appears to be a small Christmas tree or a large bundle of foliage.\n*   The second man is not \"holding a small, white dog.\" He is not holding anything; his hands are at his sides as he walks.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is incomplete. It entirely omits the first few moments of the video, where a different man in a vest is seen at the end of the hall before being embraced by a woman in a green dress. The instructions state to describe subjects in the order they appear, and these initial subjects are missed.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption fails to adhere to several key instructions:\n*   **Factual Accuracy:** The most critical failure is the violation of the rule to \"avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\" The caption invents two animals that are not present in the video.\n*   **Order of Appearance:** By skipping the initial man and woman, it fails to describe the subjects in the order they are introduced.\n*   **Focus on Subjects:** The sentence \"The corridor's design... contributing to the setting's vintage train ambiance\" focuses more on interpreting the background atmosphere than describing the subjects, which deviates from the primary instruction to focus on subjects.\n*   **Clarity:** The final sentence claims the video emphasizes \"the animals they carry,\" which is false and therefore misleading.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens on a long, narrow corridor of a train with light green walls and a patterned floor. At the far end, a man in a dark vest over a white shirt stands with his hands clasped. A woman in a green dress then enters from the left and embraces him. The scene then shows two different men walking down the corridor toward the camera. The man in the lead wears a green uniform and a matching cap and carries a large, bushy green object resembling a small tree. Following him is a man wearing a white shirt, a dark vest, and a red Santa hat.",
