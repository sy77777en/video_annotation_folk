    "pre_caption": "This is a cityscape scenery shot capturing a drive through a bustling urban street at night. The scene is dominated by vibrant, glowing neon signs in various colors, including green, red, and yellow, which cast long, shimmering reflections on the wet, dark asphalt. Buildings line the street, their facades adorned with these luminous advertisements, while cars are parked along the road and visible in the distance. There is no main subject in this video; the focus is on creating a specific mood and capturing the immersive, rain-slicked, neon-drenched atmosphere of the city. The wide, slightly distorted perspective from what appears to be inside a vehicle enhances this focus on the environment rather than any single element within it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies this as a cityscape scenery shot and accurately describes the key visual elements like the neon signs and wet reflections. However, it includes subjective or interpretive language that should be removed, such as \"bustling,\" \"vibrant,\" \"immersive,\" and the phrase \"creating a specific mood,\" as the instruction requires avoiding subjective adjectives that convey emotions. The final two sentences, which explain the focus on the environment, are slightly redundant and could be combined into a single, more concise statement to improve clarity and flow. For instance, the description of the perspective could be integrated with the explanation for the lack of a main subject.",
