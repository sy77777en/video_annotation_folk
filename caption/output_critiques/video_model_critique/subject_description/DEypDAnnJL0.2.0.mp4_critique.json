    "pre_caption": "The video features a woman with light skin and long, curly blonde hair. She is wearing a loose, cream-colored knit sweater. At different points, she is seen sitting on the floor and looking upward, as well as standing close to a door and facing it. Her facial expression appears neutral and focused, and she is oriented toward the door throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "An evaluation of the caption is provided below.\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is mostly accurate in its description of the woman's physical attributes, such as her light skin, long curly blonde hair, and cream-colored knit sweater. It also correctly notes her positions—sitting on the floor and standing near the door. However, the description of her facial expression as \"neutral and focused\" is highly inaccurate. In the video, the woman's eyes are wide and her mouth is agape, which are clear physical indicators of an intense emotional state like fear, panic, or shock, not neutrality or simple focus.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is incomplete as it omits a key action: the woman actively trying to turn the doorknob. This interaction is central to the scene's narrative. Furthermore, by failing to describe the physical details of her facial expression (wide eyes, open mouth), it misses the most salient visual information that defines the character's situation.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption adheres to several instructions: it is a single paragraph, uses simple English, avoids terms like \"image\" or \"frame,\" and correctly identifies the subject and her basic visual attributes. However, it fails significantly in one key area. The instruction states to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" While the caption attempts this by using the words \"neutral and focused,\" these are not only subjective but also factually incorrect interpretations of the visual evidence. A better way to adhere to the instruction would have been to describe the physical characteristics of her face (e.g., \"her eyes are wide and her mouth is open\") without assigning an emotional label. By providing an inaccurate emotional assessment, the caption fails to be objective and misrepresents the content of the video.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A woman with light skin and long, curly blonde hair, wearing a cream-colored knit sweater, is on the floor of a hallway. She looks up toward a white door with wide eyes and her mouth open. She reaches for the doorknob and tries to turn it. After the door doesn't open, she stands and presses herself against it, facing away from the camera.",
