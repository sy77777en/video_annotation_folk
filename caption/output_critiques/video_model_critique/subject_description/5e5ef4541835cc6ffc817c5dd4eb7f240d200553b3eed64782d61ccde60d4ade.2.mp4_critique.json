    "pre_caption": "The video features a wolf with a thick, grayish-brown fur coat, lying on a patch of grass. The wolf is positioned in a forested area, surrounded by tall trees with green and yellow leaves. Its body is oriented to the left, with its head turned slightly in the same direction, giving a side profile view. The wolf appears calm and relaxed. As the video progresses, the wolf disappears from the frame, leaving only the grassy area and trees visible.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **disappearing from the frame**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how they exit, whether through subject movement or camera movement.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption is a good start, but it has some issues regarding accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions. Here is detailed feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is partially inaccurate because it describes the wolf as \"lying on a patch of grass.\" While the wolf is initially in a sitting or low-crouching position, it quickly stands up and walks away. Describing its state as only \"lying\" misrepresents the main action of the video.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is incomplete. It omits the key sequence of actions that occurs in the middle of the video. It fails to mention that the wolf stands up from its initial position, briefly sniffs the ground, and then turns and walks away, exiting the frame. Describing the transition as the wolf simply \"disappearing\" is not detailed enough.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violation of \"No Subjective Adjectives\":** The caption uses the words \"calm and relaxed\" to describe the wolf. This violates the instruction: \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" You should describe the animal's physical state or actions (e.g., \"is stationary,\" \"is sitting\") rather than interpreting its mood.\n*   **Incomplete Description of Action:** The instruction states, \"If the video features subjects revealing, disappearing, or switching, describe the transition in detail.\" Your description of the wolf \"disappearing\" is too vague. A better description would detail the actions of the wolf standing, turning, and walking out of view.\n*   **Focus on a Single Moment:** The caption focuses heavily on the wolf's initial pose (\"lying,\" \"oriented to the left\"). The instructions require you to \"describe the video by combining details from the frames,\" which means summarizing the entire sequence of events, not just the opening shot.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A wolf with a thick, grayish-brown fur coat is initially seen in a side profile, sitting on a grassy mound in a forest. The background is filled with tall tree trunks and foliage with green and yellow leaves. The wolf stands up, briefly lowers its head to sniff the ground, then turns its body away from the camera. It proceeds to walk away and exits the frame, leaving a view of the empty grassy mound and the forest background.",
