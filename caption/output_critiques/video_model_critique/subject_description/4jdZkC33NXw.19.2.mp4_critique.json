    "pre_caption": "This video presents a streetscape scenery shot of a quiet suburban road in Japan on a rainy day. The focus is on capturing the overall atmosphere and environment rather than a specific subject, with the wide, stationary perspective allowing the viewer to take in the entire scene. In the foreground, a lush flowerbed filled with bright yellow and purple blossoms lines a wide, paved sidewalk, contrasting with the grey, wet conditions. Cars travel along the wet, two-lane road, which is flanked by residential houses and some commercial buildings. In the distance, the distinctive netting of a large golf driving range stands out against the cloudy sky, with a complex web of power lines overhead, contributing to the tranquil, everyday ambiance of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is overly descriptive and contains subjective language and interpretations that violate the instructions. The sentence, \"The focus is on capturing the overall atmosphere and environment rather than a specific subject, with the wide perspective allowing the viewer to take in the entire scene,\" is too explanatory. The instruction asks for a brief explanation, which should be more concise. The caption also uses subjective adjectives and phrases such as \"lush,\" \"bright,\" \"distinctive,\" \"stands out,\" and \"complex web,\" as well as interpretive phrases like \"contrasting with the grey, wet conditions\" and \"contributing to the tranquil, everyday ambiance of the scene,\" which should be removed in favor of neutral, objective descriptions. Additionally, the caption omits a prominent foreground object: the black lamppost standing in the median. To improve, remove the subjective and interpretive language, shorten the explanatory sentence, and add a description of the black lamppost.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is a wide, stationary shot of a suburban street in Japan on a rainy day. The foreground shows a paved sidewalk and a median containing a black lamppost and a flowerbed with yellow and purple blossoms. Cars drive on the wet, two-lane road, which is lined with residential and commercial buildings. In the background, the netting of a golf driving range is visible under a cloudy sky, with power lines overhead.",
