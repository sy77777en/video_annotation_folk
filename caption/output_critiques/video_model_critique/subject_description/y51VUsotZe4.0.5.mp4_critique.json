    "pre_caption": "This is a cityscape scenery shot capturing a drive through a vibrant, rain-slicked city street at night. The scene is dominated by a dense array of glowing neon signs in various colors—red, green, yellow, and blue—that line the buildings and reflect brilliantly off the wet pavement, creating a glossy, dreamlike atmosphere. The focus is on the immersive environment and moody aesthetic rather than a specific subject, an effect enhanced by the moving, wide-angle perspective that distorts the view and envelops the viewer in the dynamic, light-filled urban landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption violates the instruction to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions\" by using words like \"vibrant,\" \"brilliantly,\" \"dreamlike,\" \"immersive,\" \"moody aesthetic,\" and \"dynamic.\" The description should be more objective. For instance, instead of describing the street as \"vibrant,\" the caption should focus on the visual elements that create this impression, such as the variety and brightness of the neon signs. The phrase \"creating a glossy, dreamlike atmosphere\" is an interpretation of the mood, not a direct visual description. The final sentence explaining the focus on the \"immersive environment and moody aesthetic\" should also be rephrased to be more neutral, simply stating that the focus is on the urban environment and the visual effect of the lights and reflections.",

The scene features a dense array of glowing neon signs in various colors—red, green, yellow, and blue—that line the buildings and reflect off the wet pavement, creating colorful highlights on the road surface. The focus is on the urban environment and the visual effect of the lights and reflections, an effect emphasized by a moving, wide-angle perspective that distorts the view and captures the motion through the light-filled landscape.",
