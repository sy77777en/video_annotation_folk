    "pre_caption": "The video presents a landscape scenery shot of a stylized wilderness. The perspective emerges from a dark, rocky cave to reveal a tranquil valley. A gentle river, shrouded in a low-lying mist, flows between grassy banks and reddish-brown rock formations. The scene is bordered by a forest of tall, green pine trees under a soft, cloudy sky, all rendered in a warm, painterly art style. There is no main subject, as the focus is on immersing the viewer in the serene atmosphere and the beauty of the natural environment itself, creating a sense of discovery.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption violates the instruction to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions\" by using the words \"tranquil\" and \"serene.\" It also uses the subjective term \"beauty.\" Furthermore, the final sentence, which explains the lack of a main subject, includes interpretations of the video's effect (\"immersing the viewer,\" \"creating a sense of discovery\") rather than sticking to a neutral description. The words \"tranquil,\" \"serene,\" and \"beauty\" should be removed. The final sentence should be rephrased to be more objective, for instance: \"There is no main subject, as the focus is on the atmosphere and the natural environment itself.\"",
