    "pre_caption": "The video features a woman with short blonde hair wearing a blue and white checkered dress, positioned near a refrigerator. She appears to be interacting with a group of people. A man in a mustard yellow sweater and dark pants is seen reaching towards a child. The child, wearing a colorful patterned outfit and a red hat, is facing the man. A woman with a pink headscarf and a light-colored dress stands nearby, partially turned away. In the background, another person with short dark hair, wearing a white shirt and dark pants, is visible near a yellow door. The scene suggests a lively interaction among the group in a domestic setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly identifies a figure in a colorful outfit and red hat as a \"child.\" This figure has a visible straw-like texture and more closely resembles a scarecrow or a person in a costume; the description should be updated to reflect this ambiguity. The caption also inaccurately describes the sequence of events, stating the door is opened to reveal the last person. Instead, the door opens and a group enters, including the man, the woman in the pink head covering, the scarecrow-like figure, and the person in the doorway. Furthermore, key visual details are missing: the person in the doorway wears a white collared shirt with a dark tie and holds a book, and the woman with the pink head covering wears a fuzzy, textured coat, not a \"dress.\" Finally, the last sentence, \"The scene suggests an interaction among the group in a domestic setting,\" is an interpretation and should be removed to adhere to the instruction of describing only visible attributes.",

This group includes a man in a mustard yellow sweater and dark pants, a woman wearing a pink head covering over a fuzzy, light-colored coat, and a figure resembling a scarecrow dressed in a colorful patterned outfit and a red hat. The man in the yellow sweater reaches toward the scarecrow-like figure. Standing in the doorway is another person with short dark hair, wearing a white collared shirt, a dark tie, and holding a book. The woman in the checkered dress reacts as the group enters the room.",
