    "pre_caption": "This video presents a sweeping cityscape scenery shot of Paris at night, viewed from across the Seine River. The grand, illuminated facade of the Musée d'Orsay, with its distinctive large clock, dominates the right bank, its warm yellow lights casting long, shimmering reflections on the dark, flowing water. Along the left bank, a tree-lined promenade is lit, while in the distance, other bridges and city lights twinkle under a deep blue, partly cloudy sky. There is no single main subject, as the camera's wide, panning perspective is intended to capture the overall romantic atmosphere, architectural beauty, and vibrant nocturnal energy of the urban landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption violates several instructions. It uses temporal framing like \"This video begins with\" and \"The video concludes with,\" which should be avoided in favor of a holistic description. It also includes subjective and emotional language such as \"grand,\" \"romantic atmosphere,\" \"architectural beauty,\" and \"vibrant nocturnal energy,\" which is explicitly forbidden. The final sentence is entirely subjective and should be removed. The caption is also longer than the one-to-three-sentence limit specified for scenery shots. Additionally, it omits a visible subject: a boat moving on the river. The description should be rewritten as a single, concise paragraph that objectively describes the cityscape, including the illuminated Musée d'Orsay with its clock, the reflections on the Seine River, the lit promenade, and the boat, while removing all subjective and temporal phrasing.",

The building's lights cast shimmering reflections on the water, where a boat is moving. On the opposite bank, a tree-lined promenade is lit, and the city is viewed under a partly cloudy sky.",
