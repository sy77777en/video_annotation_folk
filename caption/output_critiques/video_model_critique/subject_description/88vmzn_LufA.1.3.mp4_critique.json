    "pre_caption": "The video features two distinct vehicles. Initially, a large black limousine is prominently displayed, characterized by its sleek design and shiny exterior. It has an American flag mounted on the front, indicating its official or ceremonial use. The limousine's windows are tinted, and it bears a distinctive emblem on the side, suggesting a high level of importance or security. As the video progresses, the focus transitions to a black SUV. This vehicle has a robust and sturdy appearance, with chrome wheels and visible roof-mounted equipment, possibly for communication or emergency purposes. The SUV's rear lights are uniquely designed with a red and white pattern. Both vehicles are moving along a city street, indicating a convoy or procession.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **switching from one to another**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the transition occurs, whether through subject movement or camera movement.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the two main subjects and their actions. However, it can be improved by adding a missing detail and refining some descriptions for greater accuracy and objectivity. The caption omits the second flag on the limousine's front fender, which is the Presidential Seal flag. The \"distinctive emblem\" on the limousine's side should be more precisely identified as the Seal of the President of the United States. For the SUV, the \"visible roof-mounted equipment\" can be more specifically described as a red light bar and small antennas. Additionally, describing the SUV's taillights as \"uniquely designed\" is subjective; a more factual description of their red and white, vertically stacked appearance would be better. Finally, subjective terms like \"sleek,\" \"robust,\" and \"sturdy\" could be replaced with more objective descriptions of the vehicles' shapes to adhere more closely to the instructions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features two distinct vehicles. Initially, a large, black limousine is prominently displayed, characterized by its long body and tinted windows. Mounted on its front fenders are two flags: the American flag and the Presidential Seal flag. The Seal of the President of the United States is also visible on the rear passenger door. As the video progresses, the focus transitions to a black SUV. This vehicle has a large, boxy frame, chrome wheels, a red light bar, and small antennas on the roof. The SUV's taillights are vertically stacked with red and white sections. Both vehicles are moving along a city street, indicating they are part of a convoy or procession.",
