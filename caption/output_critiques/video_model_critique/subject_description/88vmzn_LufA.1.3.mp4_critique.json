    "pre_caption": "The video features two distinct vehicles. Initially, a large black limousine is prominently displayed, characterized by its sleek design and shiny exterior. It has an American flag mounted on the front, indicating its official or ceremonial use. The limousine's windows are tinted, and it bears a distinctive emblem on the side, suggesting a high level of importance or security. As the video progresses, the focus transitions to a black SUV. This vehicle has a robust and sturdy appearance, with chrome wheels and visible roof-mounted equipment, possibly for communication or emergency purposes. The SUV's rear lights are uniquely designed with a red and white pattern. Both vehicles are moving along a city street, indicating a convoy or procession.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **switching from one to another**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the transition occurs, whether through subject movement or camera movement.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on the caption. It is accurate, well-structured, and follows most of the instructions very well. Here is a detailed breakdown of your feedback:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description of both the black limousine and the black SUV is highly accurate. Details like the American flag, tinted windows, side emblem, chrome wheels, and roof equipment are all correctly identified from the video.\n*   The description of the vehicles' movement along a city street is also correct.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is very thorough. It successfully captures the most salient features of both vehicles.\n*   **Minor Omission:** The limousine has two flags on the front: the American flag and the Presidential Seal flag. The caption only mentions the American flag. Including the second flag would add a bit more detail and strengthen the \"official use\" context.\n*   **Minor Specificity:** For the SUV, \"visible roof-mounted equipment\" is good, but could be slightly more specific by mentioning the red light bar and antennas visible on the roof.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is a clear, single paragraph written in natural English. It effectively combines details from the different shots into a coherent narrative.\n*   **Subject Identification:** You correctly use precise terms (\"limousine,\" \"SUV\") and describe their key visual attributes in detail.\n*   **Handling Transitions:** The phrase \"As the video progresses, the focus transitions to a black SUV\" is an excellent way to describe the cut between the two shots without using forbidden terms like \"frame\" or \"scene.\"\n*   **Avoiding Inference:** The caption does an excellent job of sticking to visual facts. The interpretations provided (\"indicating its official or ceremonial use,\" \"indicating a convoy or procession\") are logical, well-supported by strong visual evidence (Presidential Seal, escort-style vehicle), and add valuable context, making them acceptable within the spirit of the instructions.\n*   **Objectivity:** The descriptive adjectives used (\"sleek,\" \"shiny,\" \"robust,\" \"sturdy\") are appropriate for describing physical appearance and do not convey subjective emotions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThis is a high-quality caption that meets the requirements of the prompt. It is descriptive, accurate, and well-written. The minor points about the second flag and the specific roof equipment are suggestions for refinement rather than significant errors. The caption successfully paints a clear picture of the video's content for someone who has not seen it.",
