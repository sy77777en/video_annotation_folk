    "pre_caption": "From a high, top-down perspective, a teal sedan with a sunroof is surrounded by several men. One man sits on the hood of the car, wearing a dark vest over a lighter-colored shirt. Another man, dressed in a black hooded jacket with red details on the sleeves, leans into the open driver's side door. To his left, another man in a black hooded jacket stands near the front of the car. On the passenger side, two men in black hooded sweatshirts lean over the car, looking inside. A sixth man in a black shirt is visible in the back seat. All the men appear to be focused on the interior of the vehicle.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains several significant factual errors and describes details that are not present in the video. The description of a man smoking a cigarette and wearing a gold bracelet is incorrect, as neither of these is visible. The number and positions of the men are misstated; the caption claims three men are sitting on the hood, but only one man, who is wearing a grey vest and not a hooded jacket, is sitting on the hood with his back to the camera. The man with red on his clothing is the one leaning out of the driver's seat, not one of the men on the passenger side as the caption states. Furthermore, the pose of the man standing by the open door is described inaccurately; he is leaning toward the car, not holding his hands to his head. The interaction described as a high-five is between the man in the driver's seat and a man leaning over the passenger side of the windshield, not with a non-existent \"smoking man.\" The entire description should be revised to accurately reflect the subjects' positions, clothing, and actions as seen in the video.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a high, top-down perspective, a teal sedan with a sunroof is surrounded by six men on a cracked asphalt surface. One man in a dark vest sits on the hood with his back to the camera. In the driver's seat, a man in a black jacket with red details on the sleeves leans his upper body out of the open door. To his left, another man in a black hoodie leans over the front of the car, reaching towards him. On the passenger side, two men in black hoodies lean over the car, one over the windshield and the other over the passenger door. A sixth man is visible in the back seat. The group appears to be focused on and interacting with the man in the driver's seat.",
