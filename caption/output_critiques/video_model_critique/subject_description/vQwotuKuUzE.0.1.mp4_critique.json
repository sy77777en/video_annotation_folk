    "pre_caption": "The main subject of the video is a Black man shown in a close-up profile, facing to the right. He has short, dark hair, a light goatee, and a serious expression with his mouth slightly open. He is wearing a dark shirt and has a clear, coiled earpiece in his right ear, with the wire running down his neck. A thin chain is also visible around his neck. The lighting is dramatic, casting most of his face in shadow while highlighting the contours of his profile. Briefly visible behind him and to his left is a second Black man, also wearing dark clothing and what appears to be an earpiece, looking in the same direction.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with one clear main focus**, so you need to clarify who the main subject is. The description should focus on the details of the main subject while concisely summarizing secondary subjects and describing their relationship to the main subject if clear.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly describes a silver-colored chain around the main subject's neck as a \"strap.\" It also uses the subjective term \"serious expression,\" which should be replaced with a more objective description of his facial features, such as his mouth being open as if speaking. The description omits a key action: the man turns his head from a profile view to face more towards the camera. Finally, the phrase \"The video begins with\" should be removed to create a more holistic description that combines details from the entire clip rather than describing it chronologically.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A Black man is shown in a dramatic, high-contrast close-up, with most of his face cast in shadow. He has short, dark hair, a light goatee, and is wearing a dark shirt. A clear, coiled earpiece is in his right ear, with the wire running down his neck, and a thin, silver-colored chain is visible around his neck. Initially seen in profile facing right, he turns his head slightly towards the camera with a tense look, his mouth open as if speaking. In the background, the bright, out-of-focus shapes of city buildings are visible. Briefly, a second Black man, also in silhouette and wearing an earpiece, can be seen behind him.",
