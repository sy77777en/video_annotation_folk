    "pre_caption": "This video is a majestic aerial landscape scenery shot of a snow-covered mountain range. A prominent peak, blanketed with dense, snow-dusted evergreen trees, rises sharply in the foreground, its steep face descending towards a vast sea of white clouds that fills the valleys below. In the far distance, another range of jagged, snow-capped mountains is visible above the clouds under a pale blue sky. There is no main subject because the composition is designed to capture the immense scale and serene, powerful atmosphere of the natural environment. The focus is on the grandeur of the wilderness itself, rather than any single object within it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

The caption also begins with the introductory phrase \"This video is a,\" which should be deleted. Finally, the last two sentences explaining the lack of a main subject are redundant and should be combined into a single, more concise sentence. For example, the explanation could be shortened to: \"There is no main subject, as the focus is on the scale of the natural environment rather than a single object.\"",
