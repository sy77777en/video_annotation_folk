    "pre_caption": "This video presents an atmospheric interior scenery shot of a desolate hallway. At the far end, a closed door stands beneath a light fixture that initially bathes the entire corridor in an intense, ominous red glow. This alarming light flickers and then abruptly shuts off, plunging the scene into near-complete darkness. The only remaining illumination is a faint, cool light filtering through a paned window on the left wall, leaving the hallway looking cold and mysterious. The focus is not on a particular subject but on the environment itself, using the dramatic shift from a threatening red to a desolate darkness to build a powerful sense of suspense and unease.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption violates the instruction to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions\" by using words such as \"atmospheric,\" \"desolate,\" \"intense,\" \"ominous,\" \"alarming,\" \"cold,\" \"mysterious,\" \"dramatic,\" \"threatening,\" \"suspense,\" and \"unease.\" The final sentence, which explains the video's effect on the viewer, is entirely subjective and should be rephrased to be purely descriptive. Additionally, the caption omits a visible detail: the sign above the door, which clearly displays the number \"13.\" The description should be revised to remove all emotional and subjective language, include the detail about the number \"13\" on the sign, and neutrally describe the focus on the environmental change in lighting.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video presents an interior shot of a hallway. At the far end, a closed door is positioned beneath a sign that reads \"13.\" Initially, a light fixture above the sign illuminates the entire corridor with red light. This light flickers and then turns off, plunging the scene into near-complete darkness. The only remaining illumination comes from a paned window on the left wall, casting a dim light into the space. The video focuses on this transition in the environment's lighting.",
