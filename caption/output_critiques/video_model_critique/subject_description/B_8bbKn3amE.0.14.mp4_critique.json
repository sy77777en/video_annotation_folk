    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on this caption. It is highly accurate and detailed, but it fails to adhere to one of the key negative constraints. Here is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description of the scene is very accurate. It correctly identifies the fast-moving aerial perspective, the golden-brown grassy ridge, the dark-water lake, the snow-capped mountains, and the blue sky with clouds. All the visual elements present in the video are captured in the text.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is comprehensive. It covers the primary, secondary, and background elements of the landscape, providing a full picture of the environment shown. The explanation for why there is no main subject is also thorough and well-reasoned.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   The caption correctly identifies the video as a scenery shot and follows the specific instructions for this type of content.\n    *   It successfully explains the lack of a main subject by focusing on the scale and environment.\n    *   It is a single, coherent paragraph and avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   It uses descriptive language to detail the visual attributes of the landscape (e.g., \"golden-brown grassy ridge,\" \"dark-water lake,\" \"snow-capped peaks\").\n\n*   **Area for Improvement:**\n    *   **Violation of \"Avoid subjective adjectives\":** The main issue with the caption is its use of subjective and emotional adjectives. The instructions state, \"**You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.**\" The caption includes several such words:\n        *   \"**dramatic** landscape\"\n        *   \"**serene**, dark-water lake\"\n        *   \"**majestic** range\"\n        *   \"**breathtaking** beauty\"\n        *   \"**grandeur** of the natural world\"\n\n    These words describe the feeling or impression the scene evokes rather than its objective visual characteristics. They should be replaced with neutral, descriptive terms. For example, instead of \"serene lake,\" you could say \"a calm lake with dark water.\" Instead of \"majestic range,\" you could say \"a large range of high, jagged peaks.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is factually excellent and well-structured, but its failure to avoid subjective, emotional language is a significant deviation from the provided instructions. To be compliant, all subjective adjectives must be removed and, if necessary, replaced with objective descriptions.",
