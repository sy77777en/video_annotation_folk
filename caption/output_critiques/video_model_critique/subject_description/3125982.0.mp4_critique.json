    "pre_caption": "The video features a woman engaged in a plank exercise. She is wearing a dark sports bra and bright red shorts, with fingerless gloves on her hands. Her skin tone is light, and her long hair is tied back. The focus is on her athletic posture, with her body parallel to the floor, supported by her hands and feet. The scene emphasizes her physical activity and form.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good for this video.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The most significant error is identifying the action as a \"plank exercise.\" The video clearly shows the woman performing a push-up, as she is lowering and raising her body. A plank is a static hold. This is a critical factual inaccuracy regarding the main action in the video.\n*   The description of her clothing (\"dark sports bra and bright red shorts\"), gloves, and hair is accurate.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption correctly identifies the main subject and her key visual attributes. However, it misses the dynamic nature of the movement, which is central to the video.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Subjectivity:** The phrase \"athletic posture\" is a subjective adjective that conveys a positive judgment, which the instructions advise against. A more neutral description of her form would be better (e.g., \"with her back straight\").\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The caption is concise, but the inaccuracy about the exercise makes it unclear and misleading.\n*   **Other Instructions:** The caption successfully follows the other rules, such as using a single paragraph, avoiding terms like \"frame,\" and focusing on the salient subject.\n\nIn summary, the caption fails because it misidentifies the core action being performed, which is a fundamental error. It also includes a subjective term, violating one of the negative constraints.",
