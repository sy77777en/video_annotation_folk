    "pre_caption": "The video features a man with a medium-dark skin tone, wearing a large, light-colored hat and distinctive white, oversized sunglasses. He has long dreadlocks and a gray beard. His attire includes a green jacket over a colorful, patterned shirt, accessorized with layered necklaces. The man appears to be in a dimly lit indoor setting with vibrant, warm lighting and decorative elements like hanging flags and neon signs. His expression is neutral, and he is oriented slightly to the side, suggesting a casual or relaxed demeanor.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is generally accurate and provides a good description of the main subject. However, it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description of the man is accurate. He has a medium-dark skin tone, long dreadlocks, a gray beard, and is wearing a light-colored hat, white oversized sunglasses, a green jacket, a patterned shirt, and layered necklaces.\n*   The description of his expression as \"neutral\" is accurate.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is very complete in its description of the main subject's visual attributes, covering his clothing, accessories, and physical features in detail.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violation:** The caption violates the instruction: \"Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects...\" The sentence, \"The man appears to be in a dimly lit indoor setting with vibrant, warm lighting and decorative elements like hanging flags and neon signs,\" describes the background in detail, which is explicitly forbidden unless necessary for context, which it is not here.\n*   **Violation:** The caption violates the instruction: \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The phrase \"suggesting a casual or relaxed demeanor\" is a subjective interpretation of his posture and expression, not a direct, objective observation. The description should stick to what is visually present (e.g., \"his expression is neutral\") without inferring mood or demeanor.",
