    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the subject is revealed through either subject movement or camera movement.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is excellent and adheres to all the provided instructions. Here is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subject as a grey squirrel and the object it lands on as a tree stump. The description of the squirrel's actions—jumping up from out of view, landing, and nibbling on an object—perfectly matches the events in the video. The physical description of the squirrel (grey fur, white underside, bushy tail) and the stump (rough, textured bark) is also precise.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe description is very complete. It captures the entire sequence of events shown in the video without leaving out any key details. It describes the squirrel's appearance, its dynamic entrance into the scene, its final pose, and its activity. The mention of the \"small, indistinct object\" is a great example of being thorough while adhering to the rule of not describing what is uncertain.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Conciseness and Focus:** The caption is a single, well-structured paragraph that focuses entirely on the main subject (the squirrel) and its immediate environment (the stump), correctly omitting irrelevant background details like the fence and trees.\n*   **Objectivity:** The language is objective and descriptive. It avoids subjective or emotional words, sticking to factual visual information.\n*   **Descriptive Detail:** The caption excels at providing specific visual attributes as instructed. \"Grey fur, a white underside, and a large, bushy tail with mixed grey and brown fur\" is a detailed and accurate description.\n*   **Action and Transition:** It effectively describes how the subject appears in the scene (\"reveals a grey squirrel as it jumps up from out of view\"), which is a crucial part of the video's content.\n*   **Clarity and Formatting:** The caption is written in simple, natural English and is presented as a single paragraph without any introductory text or markdown, as requested. It correctly avoids terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the instructions. It is accurate, comprehensive, and written in a clear, objective style.",
