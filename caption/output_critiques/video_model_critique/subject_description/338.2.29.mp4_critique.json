    "pre_caption": "The video features a restaurant scene with a focus on a woman in a denim jacket seated at a round table. She has light hair styled with volume and is engaged in conversation while holding a menu. Next to her, a woman with long dark hair and glasses, wearing a maroon vest over a white shirt, is eating an ice cream cone. The table is set with plates and drinks, indicating a meal in progress. In the background, other patrons and staff are visible, including a man in a white shirt and maroon vest walking past. The setting is a busy dining area with decorative wall art, creating a lively atmosphere.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with one clear main focus**, so you need to clarify who the main subject is. The description should focus on the details of the main subject while concisely summarizing secondary subjects and describing their relationship to the main subject if clear.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your instructions, here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption:\n\n**Caption:** The video features a restaurant scene with a focus on a woman in a denim jacket seated at a round table. She has light hair styled with volume and is engaged in conversation while holding a menu. Next to her, a woman with long dark hair and glasses, wearing a maroon vest over a white shirt, is eating an ice cream cone. The table is set with plates and drinks, indicating a meal in progress. In the background, other patrons and staff are visible, including a man in a white shirt and maroon vest walking past. The setting is a busy dining area with decorative wall art, creating a lively atmosphere.\n\n---\n\n### **Feedback**\n\n**Accuracy: Needs Improvement**\n\n*   **Major Error:** The caption incorrectly states that the woman in the denim jacket is \"holding a menu.\" In the video, she is gesturing with her right hand and is not holding a menu. A different woman in the background, seated behind her, is looking at a menu. This is a significant factual error.\n*   **Mostly Accurate:** The descriptions of the woman with the ice cream (\"long dark hair and glasses, wearing a maroon vest over a white shirt, is eating an ice cream cone\"), the table setting, and the background waiter are all accurate.\n\n**Completeness: Good, but could be more detailed**\n\n*   **Missing Action:** The caption misses a key action at the beginning of the video where the woman in the maroon vest gives a high-five to a person on her left.\n*   **Missing Details:** The description of the woman in the denim jacket omits that she is wearing a red or burgundy turtleneck underneath her jacket. The description of the woman in the vest omits the visible name tag on her vest. While not essential, these details would add to the completeness.\n*   **Focus:** The caption states the focus is on the woman in the denim jacket. However, the woman with the ice cream is arguably an equal, if not greater, focal point due to her central position, unique action (eating an ice cream cone), and the initial high-five.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions: Mostly Good, with one key violation**\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   The caption is a single, coherent paragraph.\n    *   It correctly uses precise subject types (\"man,\" \"woman\").\n    *   It avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   It successfully distinguishes between subjects using their visual attributes.\n    *   The language is simple and natural.\n*   **Weaknesses:**\n    *   The caption violates the crucial instruction: **\"You must avoid describing what is not visible.\"** The incorrect statement about the menu is a direct breach of this rule.\n    *   The phrase \"creating a lively atmosphere\" leans slightly subjective, but it is a reasonable interpretation of a busy restaurant scene and a minor issue compared to the factual error.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is well-structured and follows most of the stylistic guidelines. However, its value is significantly undermined by a major factual inaccuracy regarding the woman in the denim jacket. To be considered a good caption, it must be corrected to accurately reflect the visible actions and details in the video.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a busy Chinese restaurant, a woman with dark hair and glasses, wearing a maroon vest over a white shirt, gives a high-five to a person to her left before licking a mint-colored ice cream cone. A name tag is visible on her vest. Seated next to her at a round table is a woman with light, voluminous hair, wearing a denim jacket over a red turtleneck, who gestures with her hand as she talks. On their table, which is covered with a white cloth, sits a lazy Susan with a plate of food, glasses of soda, and small bowls. In the background, a male waiter in a matching maroon vest walks past other diners, and the walls are decorated with ornate, carved wooden art.",
