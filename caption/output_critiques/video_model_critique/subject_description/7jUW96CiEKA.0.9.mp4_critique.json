    "pre_caption": "The video features a white egret with a long neck and slender body, standing near the edge of a water body. Its plumage is smooth and bright, and it has a distinct yellow beak. The egret is positioned close to the water, with its legs partially submerged, suggesting it is either wading or preparing to move. The setting includes grassy vegetation along the bank, providing a natural habitat for the bird. The egret's posture is attentive, with its head slightly tilted, indicating alertness or focus on its surroundings.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good for this video.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:** The description is factually accurate. The video does show a white egret with a yellow beak standing in the water near a grassy bank.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption captures the main subject and its key visual characteristics.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption fails to adhere to several key instructions:\n\n1.  **Violation of \"Avoid subjective adjectives\":** The instruction states, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption violates this by using words like \"attentive,\" \"alertness,\" and \"focus.\" These words describe the bird's internal state, which is an interpretation and not a direct visual observation. A better description would focus on the physical posture, such as, \"The egret stands with its neck curved and its head tilted to one side.\"\n\n2.  **Violation of \"Don't mention the background unless it's necessary\":** The instruction says not to describe the background unless it's needed to distinguish subjects or describe their relationship. The caption describes the \"grassy vegetation along the bank\" and interprets it as a \"natural habitat.\" This detail is not necessary to describe the egret itself and adds unnecessary information.\n\n3.  **Violation of \"Avoid describing what you are unsure about\":** The caption includes the phrase \"suggesting it is either wading or preparing to move.\" This is an inference about the bird's potential actions and intentions, which goes against the instruction to describe only what is visible.\n\nIn summary, while the caption is factually correct, it includes subjective interpretations, unnecessary background details, and inferences about the subject's intent, all of which are explicitly forbidden by the instructions. A compliant caption would be more objective and focused solely on the observable attributes of the egret.",
