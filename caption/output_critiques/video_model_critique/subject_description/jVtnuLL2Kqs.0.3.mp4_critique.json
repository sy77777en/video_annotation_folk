    "pre_caption": "This video captures a dramatic time-lapse cityscape scenery shot featuring the grand, neoclassical facade of Buckingham Palace. The imposing stone building, complete with its ornate black and gold gates, stands firm under a sky of heavy, grey clouds that sweep rapidly across the frame. This is a scenery shot as the focus is not on any particular person or object, but rather on the monumental scale of the architecture and the moody, dynamic atmosphere created by the fast-moving sky. The time-lapse effect, which blurs the pedestrians into indistinct streaks of movement, further emphasizes the environment itself as the subject, highlighting the enduring presence of the landmark against the fleeting passage of time.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is overly long and contains redundant and interpretive information. The final two sentences (\"This is a scenery shot as...\" and \"The time-lapse effect, which blurs...\") are repetitive in explaining why the video is a scenery shot. The final clause, \"highlighting the enduring presence of the landmark against the fleeting passage of time,\" is an interpretation of the scene's meaning, not a direct visual description, and should be removed. Additionally, the caption uses several subjective adjectives (\"dramatic,\" \"grand,\" \"imposing,\" \"moody\") that should be replaced with more neutral, descriptive terms focusing on scale and appearance. The description should be condensed into a single, more concise explanation that integrates the reason for it being a scenery shot more fluently.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This time-lapse video shows the large-scale, neoclassical facade of Buckingham Palace beneath a sky of rapidly moving, heavy grey clouds. The focus is on the monumental stone architecture and its ornate black and gold gates, as the time-lapse effect blurs pedestrians into indistinct motion, emphasizing the overall environment rather than individual people.",
