    "pre_caption": "The video reveals a dining table scene. Initially, the table is set with a metallic pitcher and a bowl, both casting shadows. As the scene progresses, a tray with neatly arranged watermelon slices appears, each slice displaying vibrant red flesh with black seeds and green rinds. The table is surrounded by wooden chairs, and the lighting creates distinct shadows, adding depth to the arrangement. The focus shifts from the empty table setup to the colorful and inviting display of fruit, highlighting the transition from a simple setting to a more lively and detailed composition.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the subject is revealed through either subject movement or camera movement.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

The sentences \"This action transforms the setting from simple to vibrant, enhancing the overall composition\" and \"The focus shifts from the empty table setup to the colorful and inviting display of fruit, highlighting the transition to a more lively and detailed composition\" should be removed as they analyze the scene rather than describe it. The description of the pitcher as \"metallic\" is inaccurate; it appears to be a matte, light grey material. The caption also misses several key details, such as the hand that places the tray, the light brown wooden tray itself, the white paper on the tray, and the specific butterfly-like arrangement of the five watermelon slices. Lastly, stating the table is \"surrounded by wooden chairs\" is an overstatement, as only parts of two chairs are visible. The description should be revised to be purely objective, including the omitted details and correcting the inaccuracies.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with a top-down view of a light-colored table, upon which sit a light grey, matte pitcher and a small bowl in the upper left corner. Parts of two dark wooden chairs are visible on the left and right sides of the frame. A hand enters from the bottom of the screen and places a light brown wooden tray in the center of the table. The tray is lined with white paper and holds five slices of watermelon with red flesh, black seeds, and green rinds. The slices are arranged to resemble a butterfly, with four larger slices forming the wings and a fifth, smaller slice placed in the middle to form the body.",
