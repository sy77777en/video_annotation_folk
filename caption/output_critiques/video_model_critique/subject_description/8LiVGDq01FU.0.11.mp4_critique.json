    "pre_caption": "The video features a woman with light skin and reddish-brown hair styled in a loose bun. She is wearing a brown jacket over a blue shirt. Her expression appears focused as she looks to her left. The video captures her in a seated position initially, and then she begins to stand up, with the focus shifting to her jacket as she moves. The setting is dimly lit, emphasizing her profile and clothing details.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on this caption. It is a high-quality description that perfectly aligns with the provided instructions.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description of the woman's physical attributes (light skin, reddish-brown hair in a loose bun) and clothing (brown jacket over a blue shirt) is completely accurate.\n*   The description of her action and expression (\"expression appears focused as she looks to her left,\" \"begins to stand up\") correctly reflects what is shown in the video.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully captures the entire sequence of events in the short clip. It correctly notes her initial state, the action she takes, and the resulting shift in the camera's focus.\n*   Including the detail about the focus shifting to her jacket is an excellent observation that adds to the completeness of the description.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is a single, fluent paragraph that is both concise and rich in detail.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It correctly identifies the subject as a \"woman\" and provides the requested visual details.\n*   **Objectivity:** The language is neutral and descriptive. \"Focused\" is an appropriate, non-emotional descriptor for her expression.\n*   **Handling Motion:** The description of her standing up and the camera's movement is handled perfectly, as it's a key part of the video's content.\n*   **Formatting and Wording:** The caption avoids forbidden terms (\"image,\" \"frame\"), is not formatted with markdown, and does not include any introductory text. It correctly mentions the dim lighting as a necessary detail that explains the visual style.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe caption is exemplary. It demonstrates a thorough understanding of all instructions, providing a description that is accurate, detailed, and written in a clear, objective style. No improvements are needed.",
