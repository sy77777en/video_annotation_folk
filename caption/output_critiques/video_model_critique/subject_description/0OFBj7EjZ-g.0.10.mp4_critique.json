    "pre_caption": "The video shows two human-shaped subjects with their backs to the camera. The subject on the right, occupying the full frame height, appears to be a woman standing upright with her hands on her hips. The central subject, approximately 40% of the frame height, seems to be a child wearing a hooded outfit. Both figures are positioned facing away from the viewer, observing a group of colorful fish swimming in front of them. The fish vary in size and color, adding dynamic movement to the scene. The setting suggests an aquarium environment, with the subjects remaining stationary as they watch the aquatic life.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows two human-shaped subjects with their backs to the camera, revealing their bodies above the calf. The subject on the right occupies full frame height, while the one in the center occupies 40% of the frame height. In front of them, a group of fish swims past, suggesting a setting resembling an aquarium.**",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption is well-structured and provides a good overview of the scene. However, it could be improved in terms of accuracy and completeness regarding the visual style of the subjects.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of your caption based on the provided instructions:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description of the subjects' poses, relative sizes, and actions (standing, watching fish) is accurate.\n*   The interpretation of the setting as an \"aquarium environment\" is reasonable and well-supported by the visual evidence.\n*   The statement that the subject on the right \"occupying the full frame height\" is a slight overstatement; while tall, it does not extend to the very top of the frame.\n*   The most significant inaccuracy is in identifying the subject type. The caption describes them as \"human-shaped subjects,\" which is technically true but misses their most defining characteristic. They are not real people but stylized, low-polygon figures or sculptures. This distinction is crucial to accurately representing the video's aesthetic.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully identifies all the main subjects: the two figures and the fish.\n*   It fails to describe the key visual attribute of the figures, which is their geometric, low-polygon, and untextured appearance. This is a major omission as it defines the artistic style of the scene. Mentioning this would provide a much more complete picture.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Subject Identification:** The caption uses the term \"subjects,\" which is somewhat vague. The instructions ask for precise terms like \"man\" or \"woman,\" but also allow for reasoned judgment in cases of ambiguity. A better choice here would have been \"figures,\" \"models,\" or \"sculptures\" to more accurately reflect their non-realistic nature.\n*   **Visual Attributes:** The caption adheres to this by describing pose and clothing style but, as noted above, misses the most important attribute of material/style (low-polygon).\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is clear and written in natural English. It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **Objectivity:** The caption mostly avoids subjective language, although \"dynamic movement\" is slightly interpretive. However, it's used in a descriptive sense and is acceptable.\n*   **Structure and Focus:** The caption correctly prioritizes the human-like figures before describing the fish, which is a logical flow.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is a good attempt but falls short by not accurately identifying the type and style of the main subjects. Describing them simply as \"human-shaped\" overlooks their distinct, non-photorealistic, geometric rendering, which is a critical component of the video's visual information. A more accurate and complete caption would explicitly mention that they are low-polygon figures or sculptures.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video displays two stylized, low-polygon figures with their backs to the camera, resembling untextured, geometric sculptures. The taller figure on the right, nearly filling the frame's height, is posed like a woman with her hands on her hips. In the center, a smaller figure, about 40% of the frame's height, appears to be a child in a hooded garment. Both are stationary, observing several colorful fish swimming past them in a dimly lit, blue-toned environment that resembles the inside of an aquarium.",
