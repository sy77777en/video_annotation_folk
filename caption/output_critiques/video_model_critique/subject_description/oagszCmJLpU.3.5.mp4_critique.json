    "pre_caption": "This video is a dramatic landscape scenery shot, focusing on the immense scale and atmosphere of the environment rather than a specific main subject. A colossal, dark supercell storm cloud with a defined, shelf-like structure dominates the sky, its turbulent base churning ominously. Below the darkest part of the formation, the atmosphere is tinged with a sickly green light, a common indicator of severe weather, as curtains of heavy precipitation fall onto the flat, open prairie below. The sheer size of the weather system, filling the entire upper portion of the frame, makes the storm itself the central element, highlighting the raw power of nature.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains subjective adjectives and interpretations that violate the instructions. The words \"dramatic,\" \"ominously,\" and \"sickly,\" as well as the phrase \"highlighting the raw power of nature,\" should be removed as they convey emotion. The clause \"a common indicator of severe weather\" is an interpretation based on external knowledge, not a direct visual description, and should be deleted. The final sentence, \"The sheer size of the weather system, filling the entire upper portion of the frame, makes the storm itself the central element, highlighting the raw power of nature,\" is redundant because the first sentence already establishes the focus on the environment's scale, and should be removed to improve conciseness.",
