    "pre_caption": "The video features a group of camels and people in a rocky, desert-like setting. The camels are adorned with colorful blankets and saddles, standing or resting on the ground. The people, dressed in a variety of clothing including long coats, jackets, and head coverings, are gathered around the camels, some interacting with them. The scene suggests a gathering or preparation for a journey, with the rugged terrain and rocky backdrop providing context for the setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects with no clear main focus**. Because it does not emphasize any specific subject, please briefly describe the types of subjects without going into too much detail. You may also describe the subjects collectively as a group.",

  "generated_critique": "### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the main subjects as a group of people and camels, their key visual attributes (colorful blankets and saddles on camels; varied clothing like coats, jackets, and head coverings on people), and the rocky, desert-like environment.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is comprehensive, capturing the essential elements of the scene. It effectively summarizes the overall gathering without getting lost in the details of every individual, which is appropriate given the number of people. It mentions the subjects' state (standing, resting) and their general arrangement (gathered around).\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres very well to the given instructions.\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** It is a single, clear, and concise paragraph written in natural English.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It uses precise terms (\"camels,\" \"people\") and describes their key visual attributes.\n*   **No Speculation (Minor Point of Improvement):** The caption is almost perfect in this regard. However, the phrase \"The scene suggests a gathering or preparation for a journey\" is an interpretation of the event's purpose, not a direct observation. The instructions state to \"avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\" A more compliant alternative would be to describe the observable state, such as \"The people and camels are gathered together.\" This is a very minor point, as the inference is logical, but it does step slightly outside the strict rule of describing only what is visible.\n*   **Formatting and Structure:** It correctly avoids meta-terms like \"video\" or \"frame\" (except for the introductory phrase \"The video features,\" which is acceptable for context), and it correctly describes the scene as a whole rather than frame-by-frame.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThis is an excellent caption that successfully follows nearly all instructions. It is accurate, well-written, and provides a clear picture of the video's content. The only minor deviation is the slight interpretive language, but it does not significantly detract from the caption's overall quality.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a rocky, mountainous setting, a group of people and camels are gathered near a simple stone building. The camels, some standing and others resting, are saddled and adorned with colorful blankets. The people are dressed in a variety of clothing, including coats, jackets, and head coverings. They are clustered together, with some interacting with the camels, against a backdrop of rugged, sunlit rock faces.",
