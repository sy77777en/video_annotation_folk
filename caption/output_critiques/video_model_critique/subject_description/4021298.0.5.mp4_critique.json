    "pre_caption": "The video features a group of camels and people in a rocky, desert-like setting. The camels are adorned with colorful blankets and saddles, standing or resting on the ground. The people, dressed in a variety of clothing including long coats, jackets, and head coverings, are gathered around the camels, some interacting with them. The scene suggests a gathering or preparation for a journey, with the rugged terrain and rocky backdrop providing context for the setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects with no clear main focus**. Because it does not emphasize any specific subject, please briefly describe the types of subjects without going into too much detail. You may also describe the subjects collectively as a group.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption should be revised to better adhere to the instructions by adding more specific visual details and removing interpretive language. The current description is too general; it mentions \"jackets\" and \"head coverings\" but omits specific types visible in the video, such as puffer jackets, denim jackets, keffiyehs, and beanies. It also fails to describe the two women sitting on a bench at the beginning of the video, one wearing a light pink headscarf and the other a red scarf and grey beanie. Furthermore, the phrase \"suggests a gathering or preparation for a journey\" is an interpretation of the scene's purpose, which the instructions explicitly forbid. The description of the \"rugged terrain and rocky backdrop\" should also be removed as it focuses on the background rather than the subjects. The caption should be restructured to describe the scene as it unfolds, starting with the initial subjects and then describing the camera pan that reveals the larger group.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a view of a stone building set against a rocky cliff. Two women are seated on a bench covered with a patterned blanket; one wears a black top and a light pink headscarf, and the other wears a grey jacket, a red scarf, and a grey beanie. To the left, a camel stands draped in a blanket. The camera then pans to the right, revealing a larger group of people and several saddled camels. The crowd includes individuals wearing a variety of clothing, such as a man in a denim jacket with a red and white keffiyeh, a man in a blue puffer jacket and an orange baseball cap, and others in jackets, sweaters, and different head coverings.",
