    "pre_caption": "The video features a small human figure, likely a child based on their stature, wearing a red hooded cloak that covers most of their body, making their face and other clothing indistinguishable. This figure stands out against the dark, misty forest setting due to the bright red color of the cloak. The child appears alone and is positioned among tall, thin trees, some of which are bare while others are evergreen, with the red cloak providing a stark contrast to the muted, shadowy tones of the surrounding environment. No other people, animals, or notable objects are visible in the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good for this video.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is inaccurate because it makes factually incorrect statements. It claims the figure \"appears alone\" and that \"No other people, animals, or notable objects are visible.\" This is false. A prominent second subject, a black, blocky, flying drone with a red searchlight, appears and interacts with the scene. Additionally, there are other notable objects like a red lantern in the background and bright orange, horizontal light streaks that resemble lasers or projectiles.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is severely incomplete. It focuses exclusively on the red-cloaked figure and the general forest environment while omitting all other key subjects and the central action of the video.\n*   **Missing Subject:** It completely fails to mention the flying drone, which is a major subject that appears, moves across the screen, and illuminates the ground with its searchlight.\n*   **Missing Action:** The caption describes the figure as \"positioned,\" which implies a static state. In the video, the figure is constantly running, dodging, and seemingly engaged in combat or evasion. This dynamic action is a crucial part of the scene and is entirely missed.\n*   **Missing Objects:** It omits the orange laser-like projectiles being fired across the scene, which are a key visual element suggesting conflict.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption fails to adhere to several key instructions:\n*   **Describe all salient subjects:** It describes only one of two major subjects. The instruction states to \"describe the main subject in detail and briefly mention the secondary subjects,\" which was not done.\n*   **Describe subjects revealing or disappearing:** It fails to describe the appearance of the drone.\n*   **Combine details from the frames:** It misses significant details that appear after the first second of the video, suggesting it may have been written based on only a single frame or a very brief portion of the clip.\n*   **Describe the subject's pose and orientation:** It incorrectly describes the figure as \"positioned\" instead of running.\n\nIn summary, while the description of the red-cloaked figure itself is adequate, the caption's failure to include the drone, the action, and other key visual elements makes it an incomplete and inaccurate representation of the video's content. It misses the core narrative of the scene, which is a chase or conflict between the figure and the drone in a dark forest.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video captures a tense chase scene in a dark, misty forest at night. The primary subject is a small figure in a bright red hooded cloak, running and dodging through the blue-toned, foggy landscape. A secondary subject, a black, blocky flying drone, appears and moves across the scene, shining a wide, red searchlight onto the ground as if searching for the figure. Throughout the clip, bright orange, horizontal laser-like projectiles streak across the screen, indicating an active conflict. The environment is filled with silhouetted trees and thick fog, with a glowing red lantern visible in the background, adding to the ominous atmosphere.",
