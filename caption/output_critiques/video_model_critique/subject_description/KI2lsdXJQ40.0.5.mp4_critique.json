    "pre_caption": "The video features a small, rectangular suitcase with a hard shell and a handle, shown open to reveal its contents. Inside the suitcase, there is a neatly folded long-sleeve shirt with a red base color and white polka dots, as well as several rolled-up pieces of clothing in light colors, such as white and gray. The shirt is positioned on one side of the suitcase, while the rolled clothing items are arranged beside it. The suitcase and its contents are viewed from above, and the shirt’s collar and buttons are clearly visible, making it the most visually prominent item among the packed clothing.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly describes camera movement such as \"tracking\" and the camera revealing the suitcase; the video is a static, top-down shot where the subjects move via stop-motion animation, not the camera. There is a factual error in describing the suitcase as having a \"hard shell,\" as it is a soft-sided, fabric suitcase. The caption also violates the instructions by using the word \"frame.\" While describing the action of the shirt is appropriate, the narrative should focus on the subject's movement rather than non-existent camera work. The description should be revised to detail the stop-motion sequence where a red and white polka-dotted shirt moves, folds itself, and places itself inside the open suitcase. Furthermore, the caption omits specific details about the other contents, such as a white t-shirt with a blue and yellow stripe and several pairs of rolled socks, as well as the suitcase's white and grey pinstriped interior lining.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a static, top-down view against a white, wood-paneled background, a grey, soft-sided fabric suitcase lies open. The interior is lined with a white and grey pinstriped fabric. On the right side of the open suitcase, several pairs of rolled white and grey socks are neatly arranged above two rolled t-shirts—one white with a red graphic and another white with a blue and yellow stripe. To the left of the suitcase, a red long-sleeved shirt with white polka dots is displayed. Through a stop-motion sequence, the shirt appears to fold itself in mid-air and then moves to place itself neatly inside the right compartment of the suitcase, on top of the other clothes.",
