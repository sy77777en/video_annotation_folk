    "pre_caption": "The video presents a cityscape scenery shot of a quiet, upscale street in a European city. The narrow road is flanked by grand, historic buildings with ornate stone facades and rows of windows, creating an atmosphere of affluence and architectural heritage. Several luxury cars are parked along the street, including a black Porsche Cayenne in the foreground, a red sports car, a grey Bentley with the license plate \"BY05 NDO,\" and a white BMW X1, alongside a white van and a few green trees. There is no main subject, as the shot is designed to capture the overall environment and atmosphere. The focus is on conveying the character and scale of the opulent urban setting rather than singling out any particular object or person.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly identifies the white vehicle in the foreground as a \"car\" when it is clearly an SUV. The description of the scene uses subjective and interpretive language such as \"upscale,\" \"affluence,\" \"architectural heritage,\" and \"opulent,\" which should be avoided in favor of objective visual descriptions. For instance, instead of stating the scene has an \"atmosphere of affluence,\" simply listing the luxury car models (Porsche, Bentley) would convey this objectively. The final sentence is redundant, as it summarizes what has already been described and is not necessary. The red sports car is identifiable as a Ferrari, which is a more precise detail than \"sports car.\"",

Several vehicles are parked along the road. In the foreground on the left is a black Porsche Cayenne SUV, with a red Ferrari parked behind it. On the right side of the street, a grey Bentley with the license plate \"BY05 NDO\" is parked in front of a white BMW X1 SUV. A white van is also visible further down the street, and a few green trees stand between the buildings.",
