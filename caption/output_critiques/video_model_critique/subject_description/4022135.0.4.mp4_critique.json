    "pre_caption": "The video captures a scene at a crowded outdoor football stadium from the perspective of the audience. In the foreground, a fair-skinned man with short, graying hair is seen from the side, wearing a green baseball cap and a gray hooded sweatshirt. He is sitting and looking towards the field. Next to him are other spectators, including a man in a white baseball cap and a gray jacket, and another man in a blue long-sleeved shirt. The stands are packed with a large crowd of people, many of whom are wearing purple and yellow clothing. Below, on the green football field marked with white lines, two teams of players in uniforms are visible from a distance. The word \"WILDCATS\" is painted in large purple letters in the end zone. The camera pans to the left, revealing a wider view of the stadium, the full expanse of the field, and the packed stands on the opposite side under an overcast sky. A large, light-colored building with a tower stands behind the far end of the stadium.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows an outdoor sports stadium during a game, with the stands full of spectators. The camera is positioned among the audience. At the start, the foreground shows a medium shot of some spectators from the left rear of them, occupying the lower left corner of the frame. The remaining space shows a more distant view of the stands and the stadium. The camera then pans left, showing a wider view of the stadium and the opposite stands.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a high vantage point in the stands of a crowded football stadium, the scene initially focuses on a spectator in the foreground—a man with short, graying hair wearing a green baseball cap and a gray hoodie. Beyond him, the stands are filled with fans, many in purple and gold, overlooking a partial view of the green football field where \"WILDCATS\" is painted in the end zone. The camera then pans to the left, revealing a sweeping, panoramic view of the entire stadium under an overcast sky. This wider shot shows the full expanse of the field, with two teams lined up near the \"BIG\" conference logo. The packed stands encircle the playing area, and a distinctive, light-colored building with a tower, marked \"RYAN FIELD,\" stands prominently beyond the far end of the stadium.",
