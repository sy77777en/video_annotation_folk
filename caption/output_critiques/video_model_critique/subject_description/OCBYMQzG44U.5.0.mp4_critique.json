    "pre_caption": "This is a surreal interior scenery shot of a liminal space, characterized by a long, narrow hallway flooded with dark, rippling water. The walls and ceiling are uniformly covered in glossy white tiles, illuminated by a series of stark, square light fixtures that cast a sterile, clinical glow. A simple metal handrail lines a narrow walkway on the right side of the flooded passage, which recedes into the distance where a large, yellow rubber duck with wide eyes floats in an alcove. There is no main subject because the focus is on the disquieting atmosphere and the unsettling scale of the environment itself. The combination of familiar architectural elements with the bizarre flooding and the out-of-place object creates a dreamlike and unnerving mood, making the space, rather than any single element within it, the central point of interest.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly classifies the video as a scenery shot with no main subject, when the rubber duck is clearly a salient subject and the focal point. The description should be rewritten to focus on the duck. The caption also violates the instruction to avoid subjective adjectives by using words like \"surreal,\" \"liminal,\" \"disquieting,\" \"unsettling,\" \"dreamlike,\" and \"unnerving,\" all of which must be removed. Furthermore, the caption completely omits the significant shot transition, where the camera zooms in and then cuts to a close-up of the duck; this transition must be described. The detailed justification for why there is supposedly no main subject is incorrect and should be deleted. Finally, the description of the duck should be more detailed, incorporating visual attributes from the close-up, such as its red-orange, slightly open beak and its large, round white eyes with black pupils.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with a shot down a long, narrow hallway flooded with dark, rippling water. The walls and ceiling are covered in glossy white tiles and lit by square light fixtures. A metal handrail lines a narrow walkway on the right side of the passage. At the far end of the hall, a large, yellow rubber duck floats in an alcove. The camera zooms in on the duck, then cuts to a close-up shot of its face. In the close-up, the duck is shown to have large, round white eyes with black pupils and a red-orange, slightly open beak, set against the tiled wall of the alcove.",
