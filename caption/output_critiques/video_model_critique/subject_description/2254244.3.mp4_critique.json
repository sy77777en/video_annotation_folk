    "pre_caption": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot. It captures an urban environment with a focus on the architectural elements and the overall atmosphere of the city. The camera work highlights the scale and layout of the city, showcasing a prominent building with a dome and a tall spire, as well as surrounding structures. The emphasis is on the interplay of light and shadow across the buildings, with the distant hills and a body of water adding depth to the scene. The lack of a specific main subject allows the viewer to appreciate the broader cityscape and its ambiance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work. The caption is well-written and perfectly aligns with the provided instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the video as a \"cityscape scenery shot\" and accurately describes the key visual elements: a \"prominent building with a dome,\" a \"tall spire,\" \"surrounding structures,\" \"distant hills,\" and a \"body of water.\" The description of the \"interplay of light and shadow\" is also a precise observation of the hazy, bright lighting conditions in the video.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is perfectly complete for this type of video. It correctly recognizes that there is no single salient subject and instead focuses on the overall scene, as instructed. It successfully captures the architectural focus, the scale of the city, and the atmospheric quality of the shot without adding unnecessary or speculative details.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   The caption follows all instructions flawlessly.\n    *   **Scenery Shot Protocol:** It perfectly executes the specific instruction for scenery shots. It begins by identifying the shot type (\"The video is a cityscape scenery shot\") and concludes with a clear explanation for the lack of a main subject (\"The lack of a specific main subject allows the viewer to appreciate the broader cityscape and its ambiance\").\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The description is concise, clear, and written in a single, coherent paragraph using simple, natural English.\n    *   **Objectivity:** It avoids subjective or emotional language.\n    *   **Formatting:** It is a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown.\n    *   **Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   **Focus:** It correctly focuses on the overall environment and architectural elements, which are the true subjects of this scenery video.",
