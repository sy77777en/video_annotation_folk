    "pre_caption": "The video features a small, light brown tabby kitten with distinct dark stripes and a soft, short coat. The kitten is resting on a black, rounded surface, possibly a cushion or bag, with its eyes closed, suggesting it is asleep. Its ears are pointed and upright, and its front paw is extended forward, relaxed over the edge of the surface. The kitten's head is slightly tilted, and its whiskers are visible against its face, adding to its serene appearance. The overall posture and expression convey a sense of calm and restfulness.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe caption is excellent. It is highly accurate, very detailed, and adheres to almost all of the instructions. It successfully creates a clear and comprehensive picture of the video's content. There is only one minor area for improvement regarding the use of subjective language.\n\n**Feedback Breakdown:**\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description is perfectly accurate. It correctly identifies the subject as a \"small, light brown tabby kitten\" and precisely describes its markings (\"distinct dark stripes\"), posture (\"resting,\" \"paw is extended forward,\" \"head is slightly tilted\"), and key features (\"eyes closed,\" \"ears are pointed and upright,\" \"whiskers are visible\"). The description of the object it's resting on as a \"black, rounded surface, possibly a cushion or bag\" is also accurate and appropriately handles the uncertainty.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is very complete. It covers all the essential visual information about the main subject without getting lost in unnecessary details. It effectively paints a full picture of the kitten's appearance and state.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is a well-written, coherent paragraph that is both concise and informative.\n    *   **Subject Focus:** It correctly focuses entirely on the primary subject (the kitten) and its immediate surroundings, ignoring the non-essential background as instructed.\n    *   **Objective Description:** The caption does a great job of describing visual attributes factually (e.g., \"light brown,\" \"dark stripes,\" \"eyes closed\").\n    *   **Use of Terminology:** It correctly avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n\n**Area for Improvement:**\n\n*   **Avoiding Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction states, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption slightly deviates from this rule with the following phrases:\n    *   \"...adding to its **serene** appearance.\"\n    *   \"The overall posture and expression convey a sense of **calm and restfulness**.\"\n\n    While the kitten certainly appears serene and calm, these words are interpretations of its emotional state rather than direct visual facts. A stricter adherence to the rules would involve describing the physical attributes that lead to this interpretation (e.g., \"its eyes are closed and its body is relaxed\") without explicitly naming the resulting emotion or feeling.\n\n**Revised Example (for illustration):**\n\nA more compliant version might end like this: \"...its whiskers are visible against its face. Its eyes are closed and its body is in a relaxed posture, indicating it is asleep.\" This revision removes the subjective words \"serene,\" \"calm,\" and \"restfulness\" while still conveying the same information through objective observation.\n\nDespite this minor point, the provided caption is of very high quality and effectively fulfills the prompt's requirements.",
