    "pre_caption": "The video features a man in a train corridor, wearing a green and red cap, a white shirt, and a dark vest with a tie. He has a mustache and is holding a small tree wrapped in netting. Behind him, another man is visible, wearing a Santa hat and a dark coat. The first man appears to be walking forward, with a focused expression, while the second man follows closely.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work. The caption is accurate, complete, and follows all instructions perfectly.\n\n**Accuracy:** The description is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the two men, their specific clothing (conductor-style uniform with a green and red cap, and a Santa hat with a dark coat), the object being carried (a small tree in netting), and the setting (a train corridor). The description of their actions and expressions is also spot-on.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is very complete, capturing all the salient details of the short video. It describes the primary subject in detail and provides enough information about the secondary subject to understand his role in the scene. The key elements—the uniforms, the tree, and the forward motion—are all included.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres flawlessly to the provided guidelines:\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** It is a single, well-structured paragraph that is easy to read and understand.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It correctly identifies the subjects as \"man\" and distinguishes them by their position and appearance.\n*   **Visual Attributes:** It provides specific and descriptive details about clothing, facial hair, and the object being held.\n*   **Objectivity:** It avoids subjective emotional language, using the descriptive and acceptable phrase \"focused expression.\"\n*   **Formatting:** It avoids forbidden terms (\"image,\" \"frame\") and is presented as a single paragraph without introductory text.\n*   **Focus:** It correctly prioritizes the main subject in the foreground before describing the secondary subject.\n\nThe caption is an exemplary execution of the instructions.",
