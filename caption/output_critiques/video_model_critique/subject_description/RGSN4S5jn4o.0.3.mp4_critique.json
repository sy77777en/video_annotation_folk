    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a man skateboarding in a skatepark. He is wearing a purple outfit with a helmet and knee pads, and he is positioned on the right side, leaning into a curve. The scene is vibrant, with colorful animated elements like a green and pink cloud and a floating multicolored object, adding a dynamic and playful atmosphere. The video transitions to a large, brightly lit billboard displaying the phrase \"The world is your canvas\" in bold, colorful letters. The billboard is elevated on a metal structure, with a city skyline visible in the background, enhancing the urban setting. The transition from the skatepark to the billboard suggests a theme of creativity and expression.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **switching from one to another**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the transition occurs, whether through subject movement or camera movement.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains several inaccuracies and violates multiple instructions. It describes the video sequentially using phrases like \"The video begins with\" and \"The video transitions to,\" which should be avoided in favor of an integrated description. The description of the skateboarder's clothing is incorrect; he wears a purple jacket with a solid yellow block on the back, not a shirt with a striped pattern. The animated clouds are lime green with red outlines, not yellow and pink. The caption also uses subjective and interpretive language such as \"vibrant,\" \"playful atmosphere,\" and \"suggests a theme of creativity and expression,\" which are explicitly forbidden. Furthermore, it omits several salient subjects, including a green iguana on the billboard, a flying saucer with an octopus-like creature, other stylized animated people, and a person on a BMX bike. The description of the \"floating multicolored object\" is too vague for the four-legged creature. The paragraph should be rewritten to be a single, objective description of all subjects present in the scene, correcting the factual errors and removing the sequential and subjective phrasing.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a skatepark at dusk, a person wearing a purple jacket with a yellow block on the back, a white helmet, and knee pads skateboards inside a concrete bowl. Lime green clouds with red outlines trail behind the skateboarder. In the background, a person rides a BMX bike, and several stylized, animated figures stand near a colorful, four-legged creature. Overlooking the scene is a large billboard with the words \"The world is your canvas\" written in multi-colored, graffiti-style letters. A green iguana is perched on the billboard's frame. A flying saucer containing a purple, octopus-like creature floats in the sky near the billboard. The background features a city skyline with illuminated buildings, palm trees, and a stylized, star-like sun against a purple and orange sky.",
