The architecture features a mix of dark wood and light-colored facades, with some structures showcasing intricate balconies and sliding doors. The street is bordered by lush greenery, including neatly trimmed bushes and tall trees, adding a vibrant contrast to the earthy tones of the buildings. A clear blue sky overhead enhances the serene atmosphere, while a few people and a cyclist add a sense of everyday life without drawing focus away from the overall environment. The emphasis is on the harmonious blend of architecture and nature, creating a peaceful and inviting urban landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is mostly accurate in describing the cityscape scenery, traditional wooden buildings, and the greenery, but it inaccurately mentions \"a few people\" when only one man is visible, standing near a doorway, and a single food delivery person on a white electric scooter is present. The caption should specify the man’s appearance (e.g., light skin, short dark hair, white shirt, dark pants) and the delivery person’s attire (e.g., helmet, dark shirt, light pants). The mention of a \"clear blue sky\" and the focus on architecture and nature is appropriate, but the phrase \"serene atmosphere\" is subjective and should be omitted. The caption should not state that people \"add a sense of everyday life without drawing focus,\" as this is interpretive. Revise to clearly and concisely describe the two visible human subjects and their visual attributes, and remove subjective or interpretive language.",
