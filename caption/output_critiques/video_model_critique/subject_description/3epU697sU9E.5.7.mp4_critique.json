    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on this caption. It is accurate, complete, and adheres perfectly to the provided instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:** The description is entirely accurate. It correctly identifies the subject as a dark, detailed map and precisely describes the highlighted elements: the orange circle for \"Washington,\" the blue circle for the \"Flight 93 Crash Site,\" and the blue lines indicating a path.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is comprehensive. It not only lists the key visual components but also describes the map's texture and explains its function in providing geographical context. By mentioning \"blue lines\" in the plural, it correctly accounts for both the solid flight path and the dashed line, which is a subtle but important detail.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows all instructions flawlessly.\n*   It is a single, concise, and coherent paragraph.\n*   It correctly identifies the main subject (\"map\") and describes its visual attributes and the elements upon it.\n*   It uses simple, objective language and avoids subjective terms.\n*   It correctly interprets the visual as an informational graphic and describes its overall composition and purpose, which is an excellent application of the instructions for a non-traditional \"scenery\" shot.\n*   It avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n\nThe caption is a model example of how to apply the instructions to an informational graphic. No improvements are needed.",
