    "pre_caption": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing the essence of an urban environment. It features a collection of towering skyscrapers with varied architectural designs, including sleek glass facades and more traditional concrete structures. The focus is on the scale and atmosphere of the city, highlighting the interplay of light and shadow across the buildings. The absence of a main subject emphasizes the grandeur and complexity of the urban landscape, drawing attention to the environment as a whole rather than any specific object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains a factual inaccuracy: the video does not show a glass panel shattering or any dramatic or surprising event involving the buildings. Instead, the video features a slow aerial approach toward a cluster of modern skyscrapers with glass facades, focusing on the architectural details and the interplay of light and shadow on the buildings. There are no visible human or non-human subjects, and the focus is entirely on the cityscape. The caption should be revised to remove the mention of the shattering glass and the dramatic element, and instead concisely describe the video as a cityscape shot that highlights the scale and design of the urban environment, with no main subject other than the buildings themselves.",
