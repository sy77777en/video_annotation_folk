    "pre_caption": "The video features two men standing side by side. The man on the left has a dark skin tone and is wearing a dark jacket over a striped shirt. He appears to be looking slightly upward. The man on the right has a medium skin tone, short hair, and a goatee. He is wearing glasses, a dark jacket, and a brown sweater. His expression is neutral, and he is facing forward. Both men are positioned closely together, suggesting they are engaged in a shared experience or conversation.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption adheres to all instructions and provides a clear, accurate, and detailed description of the video's content.\n\n### Feedback Breakdown:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the two subjects as men and precisely details their physical attributes, clothing (dark jacket over a striped shirt, glasses, goatee, brown sweater), and posture (standing side by side, one looking up, one facing forward).\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is comprehensive. It covers all the essential visual information needed to understand the scene without including unnecessary details about the out-of-focus background. It successfully describes both subjects with an appropriate level of detail.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Concise and Informative:** The caption is a single, well-structured paragraph that is both brief and rich in detail.\n    *   **Subject Identification:** It correctly uses the precise term \"man\" and distinguishes between the two using their positions (\"on the left,\" \"on the right\").\n    *   **Visual Attributes:** It provides specific details about skin tone, clothing, facial hair, and accessories as instructed.\n    *   **Objectivity:** It avoids subjective emotional language by describing the man's expression as \"neutral.\" The final sentence, which infers a relationship (\"suggesting they are engaged in a shared experience\"), is appropriately qualified with the word \"suggesting,\" making it a reasonable interpretation based on visual evidence (their proximity) rather than a statement of fact.\n    *   **Formatting:** It correctly returns only the single-paragraph description without any introductory text or markdown.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe caption is a perfect example of how to follow the given instructions. It is accurate, detailed, objective, and well-written. No improvements are needed.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a dimly lit outdoor setting at night, two men stand side by side. The man on the left has a dark skin tone and wears a dark jacket over a black-and-white striped collared shirt. He looks upward with his mouth slightly open. The man on the right has a medium skin tone, short hair, a goatee, and glasses, and wears a brown sweater under a dark jacket. He looks forward with a neutral expression. Their close proximity suggests they are together, observing something off-screen.",
