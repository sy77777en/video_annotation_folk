    "pre_caption": "This is a majestic mountain scenery shot, capturing the immense scale of a jagged, snow-covered peak rising into a sky of deep blue and white clouds. Sunlight breaks through the cloud cover to illuminate the upper reaches of the mountain, creating a brilliant glow on the vast fields of snow and ice that contrast sharply with the dark, exposed rock faces below. There is no main subject, as the focus is entirely on the overwhelming grandeur and raw, natural beauty of the alpine environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on the caption. It is highly descriptive and captures the essence of the video well. Here is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the provided instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy & Completeness:**\n*   The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the scene as a \"mountain scenery shot\" featuring a \"jagged, snow-covered peak,\" a \"sky of deep blue and white clouds,\" and sunlight illuminating the upper sections.\n*   The description of the visual contrast between the \"vast fields of snow and ice\" and the \"dark, exposed rock faces\" is spot-on and captures a key visual element of the scene.\n*   It correctly follows the specific instruction for scenery shots by explaining why there is no main subject, noting that the focus is on the environment itself.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Structure and Format:** The caption is a single, coherent paragraph, uses simple English, and avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" It successfully describes the scene as a whole rather than frame-by-frame.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It correctly identifies this as a scenery shot without a salient subject and provides the required explanation.\n*   **Use of Adjectives:** This is the main area for improvement. The instruction states, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption uses several subjective or emotive words:\n    *   **\"majestic\"**: This is a subjective judgment of the mountain's quality.\n    *   **\"immense\"**: While the scale is large, \"immense\" carries a subjective weight of being overwhelming.\n    *   **\"brilliant\"**: This is borderline, as it can describe intense light, but it often carries a positive, subjective connotation.\n    *   **\"overwhelming grandeur\"** and **\"raw, natural beauty\"**: These phrases are entirely subjective assessments of the scene's impact and aesthetic quality, directly contravening the instruction.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is very well-written in terms of its descriptive quality and structure. However, it fails to adhere to the strict instruction to avoid subjective and emotional language. To be fully compliant, all subjective assessments (\"majestic,\" \"immense,\" \"overwhelming grandeur,\" \"beauty\") should be replaced with more neutral, objective descriptions of the visual facts.\n\n**Example of a more compliant version:**\n\n\"This is a mountain scenery shot, showing a large, jagged, snow-covered peak against a sky with patches of deep blue and white clouds. Sunlight from the upper right illuminates the higher elevations, creating a bright reflection on the snow and ice, which contrasts with the dark, exposed rock faces on the lower slopes. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the scale and natural features of the alpine environment.\"",
