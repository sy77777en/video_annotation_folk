    "pre_caption": "The video features an animated anthropomorphic fox with exaggerated, cartoon-like features. The fox has a large, bushy tail and elongated ears, and its body is drawn with fluid, dynamic lines. It is depicted in a playful pose, interacting with a circular object resembling a plate or disc. The fox's limbs are extended, and its expression appears focused and engaged. The character's design emphasizes agility and expressiveness, typical of animated creatures.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Clearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nKeep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Only mention the background or motion if necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. Avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. Use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. Avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Return only the description.\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.",

  "generated_critique": "Feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption provides a decent starting point by correctly identifying the main subject and some of its features. However, it falls short in several key areas regarding accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the specific instructions provided.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description of the object as a \"circular object resembling a plate or disc\" is inaccurate. The object is clearly a stick with a loop at the end, similar to a bubble wand or a small net. The loop is not a solid disc.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption focuses heavily on the static design of the character (\"large, bushy tail,\" \"elongated ears\") but almost entirely omits the actions that make up the entire video. It fails to mention that the fox is running, jumping, and using the object to fly or propel itself. The dynamic motion is the most significant aspect of the video, and its absence makes the description incomplete.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Avoid Subjective Adjectives:** The caption violates the instruction to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" Words and phrases like \"playful pose,\" \"expression appears focused and engaged,\" and \"emphasizes agility and expressiveness\" are interpretations of the character's mood or the artist's intent, not objective visual descriptions.\n*   **Describe Key Visual Attributes:** While it describes the fox, it fails to accurately describe the key attribute of the object it is interacting with.\n*   **Describe the Video, Not Just a Still:** The description reads more like an analysis of a single character design sheet rather than a summary of the animated action occurring throughout the video.\n\nHere is a revised caption that better aligns with the instructions:\n\nA black-and-white, line-drawn animation shows an anthropomorphic fox-like creature with a slender body, large pointed ears, and a long, bushy tail. The creature holds an object consisting of a short handle and a figure-eight-shaped loop at the end. Throughout the animation loop, the creature is shown running and jumping across a grid-patterned floor. At one point, it leaps into the air, and the loop on the object spins above its head like a helicopter rotor, keeping it aloft before it descends again.",
