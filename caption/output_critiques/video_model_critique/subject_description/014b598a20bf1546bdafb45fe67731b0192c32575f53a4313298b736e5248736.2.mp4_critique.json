    "pre_caption": "The video features two individuals dressed in Spider-Man costumes inside a gazebo. The main subject, positioned centrally, wears a red and blue Spider-Man suit with a textured web pattern and large, reflective eye lenses on the mask. This person starts in a low crouch and then rises to a standing position while gesturing with their hands. In the background, another individual wears a completely black Spider-Man-style costume with some white markings and walks towards the right side of the gazebo. Other indistinct people are visible further in the background outside the structure.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption is good, but it could be improved by being more complete. Here is a detailed breakdown:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the two main subjects as individuals in Spider-Man costumes within a gazebo. The description of the main subject's red and blue suit, including the textured pattern and reflective lenses, is precise. The description of this person's action—rising from a crouch while gesturing—is also correct. The depiction of the second individual in a black costume walking in the background is accurate as well.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is incomplete because it omits a significant visual event. At the 00:01 mark, a large, black, clawed hand appears very close to the camera in the foreground, momentarily obscuring part of the view before disappearing. This is a salient and unusual detail that is crucial for a complete description of the video's content.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths:** The caption successfully follows most of the instructions. It is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English. It avoids subjective adjectives, correctly prioritizes the central subject, and uses specific terms (\"individuals,\" \"gazebo\"). It also correctly describes the subjects' attributes and actions.\n*   **Area for Improvement:** The caption fails to adhere to the instruction: \"If the video features subjects revealing, disappearing, or switching, describe the transition in detail.\" The brief appearance and disappearance of the black, clawed hand is a key example of a subject revealing and then disappearing, and it should have been described.\n\nIn summary, the caption provides an accurate description of the two main figures but is missing a key, albeit brief, event. Including the appearance of the black hand would make the description both complete and fully compliant with the provided instructions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features two individuals dressed in Spider-Man costumes inside a gazebo. The main subject, positioned centrally, wears a red and blue Spider-Man suit with a textured web pattern and large, reflective eye lenses on the mask. This person starts in a low crouch. As they begin to rise, a large, black, clawed hand suddenly appears in the foreground, very close to the camera, before quickly disappearing from view. The person in the red and blue suit then continues to rise to a standing position while gesturing with their hands. In the background, another individual wears a completely black Spider-Man-style costume with some white markings and walks towards the right side of the gazebo.
