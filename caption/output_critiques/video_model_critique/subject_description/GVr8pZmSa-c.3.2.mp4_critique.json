    "pre_caption": "This is an underwater scenery shot. The focus is on the dark, mysterious deep-sea environment, characterized by deep blue water and floating white particles resembling marine snow. A large, elongated, dark object with a textured, reddish-brown upper surface and cracked, greyish sides lies partially buried in the sandy seabed. The dim, atmospheric lighting and the partial obscurity of the object emphasize the vastness and enigmatic nature of the underwater world rather than highlighting a specific, fully detailed subject.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on this caption. It is accurate, detailed, and adheres perfectly to all the provided instructions.\n\n### Feedback Breakdown:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the scene as an underwater environment, the deep blue color of the water, the floating particles, and the visual characteristics of the large object—its elongated shape, textured reddish-brown top, cracked sides, and partial burial in the seabed.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is very thorough. It captures all the essential visual information, including the atmospheric elements like the dim lighting and the \"marine snow,\" which contribute significantly to the scene's mood. It provides a comprehensive picture of what is shown.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Scenery Shot Protocol:** You correctly identified this as a scenery shot and followed the specific instructions for it by explaining *why* it qualifies—the focus is on the overall environment, atmosphere, and scale rather than a single, clear subject.\n    *   **Objectivity:** The caption masterfully avoids making assumptions. Instead of definitively calling the object a \"shipwreck\" (which would be an interpretation, albeit a likely one), you described it based purely on its visual attributes: \"a large, elongated, dark object.\" This is a perfect application of the instruction to describe only what is visible.\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The paragraph is well-structured, fluent, and easy to read. It delivers a lot of information without being wordy.\n    *   **Formatting:** The response is a single paragraph with no introductory text or markdown, as required.\n    *   **Descriptive Language:** The use of adjectives like \"elongated,\" \"textured,\" \"reddish-brown,\" and \"cracked\" is specific and effective, painting a clear mental image for the reader.\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\nThis is an exemplary caption that demonstrates a complete understanding of the task and instructions. It is a model example of how to describe a scenery shot with a prominent but partially obscured object. No improvements are needed.",
