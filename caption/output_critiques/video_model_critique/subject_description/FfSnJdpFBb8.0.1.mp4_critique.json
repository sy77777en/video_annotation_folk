    "pre_caption": "The floor of a crowded subway car is covered in a patch of green grass interspersed with small white, purple, and yellow wildflowers, among which small butterflies fly. A diverse group of male and female passengers of various ages are positioned around this patch of nature. In the center of the car, a man with short hair, wearing blue overalls over a yellow shirt, stands holding onto an overhead pole. To the right, a man with a dark beard, glasses, and a red beanie sits reading a book. Other passengers are seen in various poses: some sit on the blue subway seats, looking at their phones or reading, while others stand. Their clothing is casual, including a person in a green jacket, another in a brown coat, and a woman in a black top. One person sitting on the left wears jeans and has a tan shoe resting near the grassy area. The passengers occupy the space around the central patch of grass, creating a contrast between the urban setting and the natural elements on the floor.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows a crowded subway with flowers and plants covering the floor. It begins with a shot of some flowers and plants on the subway floor, along with the lower bodies of people around. The camera then tilts up and moves back, revealing more people in full bodies and the plants growing on the subway floor, with butterflies flying. In the final shot, most of the frame is obscured by the plants, leaving only a small portion of the subway visible.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption provides a highly accurate, complete, and well-structured description that perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\n### Feedback Breakdown:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description is exceptionally accurate. Every detail mentioned—the grass, the specific colors of the wildflowers, the butterflies, the diverse passengers, the man in blue overalls, the man with the red beanie reading a book, and the various clothing items—is clearly visible in the video.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is comprehensive. It successfully captures the surreal central theme (nature inside a subway car) and populates the scene with both specific, detailed individuals and a general description of the surrounding crowd. It synthesizes information from the entire clip into a cohesive whole, mentioning details from both the close-up and the wider shots.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows all instructions meticulously.\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** It is a single, fluent paragraph written in simple, natural English.\n    *   **Subject-Focused:** It focuses entirely on the visible subjects (people, grass, flowers, butterflies) and their attributes.\n    *   **Proper Terminology:** It uses precise terms like \"man,\" \"passengers,\" \"wildflowers,\" and \"butterflies,\" and avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   **Detailed Attributes:** It provides excellent detail for key subjects, including clothing (\"blue overalls over a yellow shirt\"), accessories (\"glasses, and a red beanie\"), and actions (\"stands holding onto an overhead pole,\" \"sits reading a book\").\n    *   **Subject Distinction:** It effectively distinguishes between multiple people using location (\"In the center,\" \"To the right\") and unique visual features.\n    *   **Structure and Prioritization:** It correctly prioritizes the most striking visual element—the patch of nature on the floor—before describing the people interacting with the space.\n    *   **Objectivity:** It avoids subjective emotional adjectives. The final sentence, which mentions the \"contrast between the urban setting and the natural elements,\" is an objective observation of the visual composition, not an emotional interpretation, and serves as an effective summary.\n\nThe caption is an exemplary execution of the given task.",
