    "pre_caption": "The video features a person with a bare torso, viewed from behind. The individual has short, dark hair and a light skin tone. Initially, the person occupies a smaller portion of the frame, with a significant part obscured by a black wall. As the video progresses, the obstruction diminishes, revealing more of the indoor setting and settling on a medium shot of the person. The focus remains on the upper body, highlighting the person's back and shoulders.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows a person with their torso bare, filmed from behind. Initially, the person occupies 30% of the frame's height, with only the upper body visible. At the beginning, 60% of the frame's width is blocked by what appears to be a black wall, only the center part where the subject is appears visible. As the camera moves forward, the black obstruction decreases, gradually revealing more of the indoor environment. The video ultimately settles on a medium shot of the person.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption is a good attempt, but it contains a significant inaccuracy and a minor violation of the instructions.\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The main issue is the description of the visual change. The caption states, \"a significant part [of the person] obscured by a black wall\" and \"the obstruction diminishes.\" This is incorrect. The person is fully visible from the start. What you are likely interpreting as an \"obstruction\" is either the black letterboxing of the vertical video or a slow camera pullback. The video starts with a tighter shot on the person's back and then zooms out to a medium shot, revealing more of the surrounding dark wall. There is no physical object or \"black wall\" that moves to reveal the person.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description of the person is good, capturing their orientation, bare torso, hair, and skin tone. It correctly identifies the key subject and their most prominent features.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   The caption violates the instruction to \"avoid using terms like 'image' or 'frame'\" by using the word \"frame.\"\n    *   While it attempts to describe the transition as instructed, the description is inaccurate, as noted above.\n    *   It successfully avoids subjective language and focuses on observable details.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption correctly identifies the subject and their basic attributes but misinterprets the primary action in the video (a camera pullback) as a moving obstruction. This makes the description misleading. To improve it, you should remove the reference to an \"obstruction\" and instead describe the camera's movement from a closer shot to a wider medium shot.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video shows a person with a bare torso from behind. They have short, dark hair and a light skin tone. The shot starts as a close-up on their upper back and shoulders. It then slowly pulls back to a medium shot, revealing more of their back and the dark, textured wall behind them.",
