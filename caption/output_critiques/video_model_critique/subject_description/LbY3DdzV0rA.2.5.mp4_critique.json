    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dramatic time-lapse landscape scenery shot. The composition is dominated by a vast, turbulent sky filled with deep blue and purple storm clouds, which contrast sharply with a fiery orange and red sunset glowing on the horizon. Sheets of rain are visible in the distance, illuminated by the setting sun. Below, two parallel highways stretch through the darkened, expansive terrain, converging toward the distant light. Headlights and taillights of cars and trucks blur into streaks of light as they travel along the roads. There is no single main subject, as the focus is on the immense scale and atmospheric power of the natural environment, with the highway serving to guide the eye and provide a sense of journey through the epic scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately follows the specific instruction for describing a scenery shot. However, it can be improved by removing subjective and interpretive language to adhere more strictly to the guidelines. The words \"dramatic,\" \"fiery,\" and especially \"epic\" are subjective adjectives that convey emotion, which the instructions state to avoid. The phrase \"provide a sense of journey\" is an interpretation of the scene's effect on the viewer rather than an objective description. Additionally, the introductory phrase \"This video presents\" is redundant. To improve, remove this opening phrase and replace the subjective adjectives with more neutral descriptors. For example, change \"dramatic\" to \"high-contrast\" or simply omit it, and replace \"fiery\" with \"bright\" or \"vivid.\" The final sentence should be rephrased to be more objective, for instance: \"...with the highway serving to guide the eye toward the horizon.\"",
