    "pre_caption": "This video presents a panoramic cityscape scenery shot, capturing the tranquil beauty of a sunset. There is no main subject, as the focus is on conveying the overall atmosphere and the grand scale of the natural light display against the urban backdrop. The camera slowly pans to the right, revealing a vast sky filled with scattered clouds illuminated in warm hues of orange, yellow, and gold by the setting sun. Below, the city is reduced to a dark silhouette of buildings and trees, with the brilliant orb of the sun gradually emerging from behind the treeline on the right, casting a final, radiant glow across the horizon.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption is very good, but there are a few areas where it deviates from the instructions. Here is a detailed breakdown:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the scene as a panoramic cityscape at sunset, the presence of clouds, the silhouetted buildings and trees, and the emergence of the sun on the right side of the frame.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe description is very complete. It successfully captures the overall atmosphere and key visual elements of the video. It correctly follows the specific instruction for scenery shots by explaining that there is no main subject and that the focus is on the environment and atmosphere.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Subjective Adjectives:** The instructions state, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption violates this rule by using the phrase \"tranquil beauty.\" While the scene might evoke these feelings, the caption should remain objective. Words like \"brilliant\" and \"radiant\" are also somewhat subjective, but they can be considered descriptive of the sun's intense light. \"Tranquil beauty\" is purely an emotional interpretation.\n*   **Introductory Text:** The instructions ask to \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\" The caption begins with \"This video presents...\", which is a form of introductory text.\n*   **Describing Motion:** The instructions state, \"Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary.\" The caption mentions, \"The camera slowly pans to the right.\" In this case, mentioning the pan is justified and necessary because it is the primary action in the video and is responsible for revealing the sun, a key visual event.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe caption is excellent in its accuracy and completeness. Its main flaw is the inclusion of subjective, emotional language (\"tranquil beauty\"), which directly contradicts a key instruction. Removing this phrase and the introductory \"This video presents...\" would make the caption fully compliant with all the rules.",
