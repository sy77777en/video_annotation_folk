    "pre_caption": "A light-skinned person's hand holds a metal wire whisk, actively mixing ingredients within a large, clear glass bowl. The bowl contains a mixture of finely chopped green herbs, a white crystalline powder, and a clear liquid. Positioned around the bowl on a light-colored, wood-grain surface are several whole and halved green limes, a small red plastic measuring spoon, and a bunch of fresh green herbs in a glass container. To the right, a clear glass jar with a handwritten label reading \"SEA SALT\" is filled with a coarse white salt.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is excellent and perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies all visible subjects: the light-skinned person's hand, the metal whisk, the clear glass bowl, and the specific ingredients. It precisely describes the surrounding items, including the whole and halved limes, the red measuring spoon, the bunch of herbs, and the glass jar, even noting the handwritten \"SEA SALT\" label and the coarse texture of its contents.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is very complete. It captures the central action of mixing while also providing a comprehensive inventory of the ingredients and tools present in the scene. No significant visual element is omitted.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is a single, well-structured paragraph that is both informative and easy to read.\n*   **Subject Identification and Attributes:** It uses precise terms (\"person's hand,\" \"metal wire whisk,\" \"glass bowl\") and details their key visual attributes (\"light-skinned,\" \"finely chopped green herbs,\" \"white crystalline powder\").\n*   **Objectivity:** It avoids subjective language and refrains from making assumptions, for example, by describing the powder as \"white crystalline powder\" rather than guessing if it's salt or sugar in the bowl. It only identifies the salt in the jar because the label is visible.\n*   **Structure and Focus:** The description correctly prioritizes the main action (mixing in the bowl) before describing the secondary objects in the surrounding area.\n*   **Formatting:** It follows all formatting rules, such as avoiding markdown, introductory text, and forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame.\" The use of motion (\"actively mixing\") is justified as it is the primary action in the video.",
