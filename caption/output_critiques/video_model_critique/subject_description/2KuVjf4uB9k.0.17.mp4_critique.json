    "pre_caption": "The video features a red sports car prominently drifting on a winding desert road. The car is sleek and aerodynamic, with visible decals and a spoiler on the back. It emits a thick cloud of white smoke from its tires, indicating high-speed motion and sharp turns. The road is surrounded by arid, sandy terrain with sparse vegetation, enhancing the sense of speed and agility as the car maneuvers through the curves. The car's dynamic movement and the smoke trail are central to the scene, emphasizing the action and skill involved in the driving.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "This is excellent feedback. Here's a breakdown of why:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **Excellent:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subject as a \"red sports car,\" its action as \"drifting,\" and the environment as a \"winding desert road.\" All the described attributes (decals, spoiler, white smoke, arid terrain) are present in the video.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   **Good but Incomplete:** The description captures the main elements well. However, it misses a few specific and notable visual details:\n    *   It fails to mention the number \"41\" clearly visible on the car's side.\n    *   Crucially, it omits that the car's trunk pops open mid-drift, which is a significant change in the object's state and a key visual event.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Partial Adherence:** The caption follows many rules but violates a few key ones.\n    *   **What it does well:** It provides a single-paragraph description, focuses on the main subject, uses natural English, and avoids meta-terms like \"video\" or \"frame\" (though it does start with \"The video features...\"). It correctly prioritizes the car as the main subject.\n    *   **Where it falls short:**\n        *   **Interpretive vs. Descriptive Language:** The instructions state to \"avoid subjective adjectives\" and focus on visual attributes. The caption uses interpretive phrases like \"indicating high-speed motion,\" \"enhancing the sense of speed and agility,\" and \"emphasizing the action and skill.\" Instead of explaining *what the visuals mean*, the caption should simply describe the visuals themselves (e.g., \"The car drifts at an angle, creating a large cloud of white smoke from its rear tires\").\n        *   **Describing Object State:** The instructions specifically ask to \"note any objects that are not in their usual state.\" The caption fails to mention the trunk popping open, which is a perfect example of this.\n        *   **Conciseness:** By including interpretive clauses, the caption becomes less concise than it could be. Removing these would make it a more direct and factual description as requested by the instructions.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe caption provides a good, accurate overview but could be significantly improved by being more strictly descriptive and less interpretive. Including the specific details of the number \"41\" and the open trunk, while removing the explanatory phrases, would make it a much stronger and more compliant description according to the provided guidelines.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "An aerial view shows a red sports car with the number \"41\" on its side drifting around a curve on a paved road in a desert landscape. The car, which has a large rear spoiler and decals on its windshield, slides sideways, creating a large cloud of white smoke from its rear tires. During the maneuver, the car's trunk pops open. The road is surrounded by arid, sandy hills with sparse vegetation.",
