    "pre_caption": "The video features two women seated at a diner booth with red cushioned seats and a wooden table. The woman on the left has light skin, wears a green beret, glasses, and a patterned brown top, and is holding a camera while smiling. The woman on the right has light skin, wears a red beret, a dark jacket, and a red scarf, and is looking towards the camera. The table is cluttered with items including a drink cup, condiment bottles, and a basket with food. The setting suggests a casual dining environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good for this video.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is inaccurate in describing the central woman on the left. It states she is \"holding a camera while smiling.\" In the video, she is holding a smartphone to take a selfie and has an exaggerated, open-mouthed expression, not a simple smile. There is a separate vintage-style camera on the table, but she is not holding it.\n*   The description of the woman on the right is mostly correct, but her jacket is dark green, not just \"dark.\"\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is incomplete as it only describes two women. There is a third woman visible in the booth behind them, and a hand from a fourth person enters the frame from the bottom left. Both are salient visual elements that are omitted.\n*   The description of the items on the table is incomplete. It mentions a drink cup, condiments, and a food basket but omits the vintage-style camera, a mug, and a small dish of what appears to be ice cream with a cherry.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   The caption fails to accurately describe the key visual attributes and actions of the main subject (the woman on the left holding a phone).\n*   By omitting two of the four people visible in the scene (the woman in the background and the person whose hand is in the foreground), it does not provide a complete description of the subjects.\n*   While it follows the structural guidelines (single paragraph, no \"image,\" etc.), the core content is flawed due to the significant inaccuracies and omissions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A high-angle shot captures a scene in a retro-style diner with red booths. In the central booth, a woman with light skin, a green beret, and glasses holds up a smartphone, making an exaggerated, open-mouthed expression for a selfie. Seated across from her, a woman with light skin, a red beret, sunglasses, and a dark green jacket smiles up at the camera. On their table are a basket of food, drinks, condiments, a mug, a dish of ice cream with a cherry, and a vintage-style camera. A third woman can be seen in the booth behind them, and from the bottom left, a person's hand enters the frame, making a gesture. The lighting is warm and dim, contributing to the vintage ambiance.",
