Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the video as a scenery shot and accurately describes the general setting as a quiet residential street. However, the final sentence is overly long and contains subjective, interpretive language such as \"sense of everyday life\" and \"ambiance,\" which the instructions state to avoid. The phrase \"suburban setting\" is also an interpretation. To improve, the final sentence should be removed for conciseness and objectivity, as the preceding sentences already fulfill the requirements for describing a scenery shot.",
