The focus is on the sterile, liminal environment itself, creating a sense of quiet desolation rather than centering on a specific character or object. The long corridor features beige walls, an orange carpet littered with scattered papers, and a ceiling with recessed fluorescent lights. White doors are marked with numbers, such as '448' and '449', and a large window on the left wall offers a glimpse into an adjacent, dimly lit office space.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

The word \"sterile\" is a subjective adjective that conveys a feeling, which should be avoided per the instructions; it is best to remove it. Additionally, the phrase \"windows on both sides of the wall\" is imprecise, as the windows are not symmetrically placed. A more accurate description would be \"windows set into the walls.\"",
