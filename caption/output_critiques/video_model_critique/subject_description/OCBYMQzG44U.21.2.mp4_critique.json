    "pre_caption": "This is an architectural scenery shot of a long, eerie corridor with a distinct liminal quality. The walls and ceiling are covered in small, greenish-yellow tiles, and the space recedes into the distance through a series of repeating arches, creating a disorienting effect. A hazy, foggy atmosphere permeates the scene, which is dimly illuminated by a single, glowing circular light fixture on the right-hand wall and a brighter, unseen light source at the far end of the passage. There is no main subject in the video, as the focus is intentionally placed on the unsettling and seemingly endless nature of the environment itself, emphasizing the atmosphere of isolation and mystery over any particular entity.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption violates the instruction to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions\" by using the words \"eerie,\" \"disorienting,\" \"unsettling,\" \"isolation,\" and \"mystery.\" It also makes an assumption about the creator's intent with the phrase \"the focus is intentionally placed\" and uses subjective interpretations like \"distinct liminal quality\" and \"seemingly endless nature.\" The final sentence should be rephrased to be more objective. To correct this, remove all emotional and interpretive language and describe the scene's features factually. For example, instead of describing an \"eerie corridor\" with a \"disorienting effect,\" simply state it is a \"long corridor\" that \"recedes into the distance through a series of repeating arches.\" The explanation for the lack of a main subject should focus on the visual characteristics, such as the repeating architecture and hazy atmosphere, rather than the feelings they evoke.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is an architectural scenery shot of a long corridor. The walls and ceiling are covered in small, greenish-yellow tiles, and the space recedes into the distance through a series of repeating arches. A hazy, foggy atmosphere permeates the scene, which is illuminated by a single, glowing circular light fixture on the right-hand wall and a brighter, unseen light source at the far end of the passage. There is no main subject in the video, as the composition's use of repeating architectural elements and a hazy atmosphere draws the viewer's eye down the length of the corridor rather than to a single focal point.",
