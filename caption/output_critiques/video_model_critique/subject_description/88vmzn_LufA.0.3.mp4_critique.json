    "pre_caption": "This video presents a cityscape scenery shot, offering a low-angle, upward-looking view of the corner of a large, multi-story brick building against a clear, pale blue sky. The structure features classic architectural details, including intricate brickwork, numerous windows arranged in a grid, and a row of arched windows along the top floor beneath a dark cornice. There is no main subject, as the camera's slow zoom-in is designed to emphasize the building's imposing scale and textural details. The focus remains on the architectural environment, creating an atmospheric and observational perspective rather than following a specific character or action.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is inaccurate because it completely omits the main subject that appears in the video. It incorrectly states, \"There is no main subject,\" when a person clearly appears in a window on an upper floor around the one-second mark. The description should be revised to first describe the building and then detail the appearance of this person, who becomes the focal point as the camera zooms in. The sentences justifying the lack of a subject should be removed and replaced with a description of the silhouetted figure in the window.",
