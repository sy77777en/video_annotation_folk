    "pre_caption": "This video captures a dynamic outdoor scenery shot. The central visual event is a green object, likely a water balloon, exploding on a rough, brown tree stump, sending a dramatic spray of clear water outwards and upwards. The water droplets catch the light, creating a sparkling, energetic effect. The background is softly blurred, revealing a pile of cut logs and indistinct green foliage, suggesting a natural, possibly wooded or garden, environment. There is no single main subject in the traditional sense; instead, the focus is on the transient, forceful action of the water bursting and interacting with the natural elements, creating an atmosphere of sudden, chaotic energy within a rustic outdoor setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly classifies the video as a \"scenery shot\" and includes a lengthy, subjective explanation for this classification, which should be removed. The video has a clear main subject: the exploding object. The description also uses subjective adjectives like \"dramatic,\" \"energetic,\" \"forceful,\" and \"chaotic,\" which should be replaced with more objective, descriptive language. Furthermore, the caption omits a key subject: the blue, rod-like object on the right side of the frame that appears to be striking the green object and causing the explosion. The description should be revised to focus on the exploding green object as the primary subject, include the blue object, and remove the interpretive final sentence.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This slow-motion, outdoor shot captures a blue, rod-like object striking a green object from the right side of the frame. The green object, resting on a brown tree stump, bursts upon impact. A large volume of clear water erupts from the object, spraying outwards and upwards. Individual water droplets are visible, catching the light as they travel through the air. The background is out of focus, showing a pile of cut logs and green foliage.",
