    "pre_caption": "The video, filmed in first-person POV, follows three people walking through an ancient site. On the left, a person is fully visible, wearing a bright orange shirt, black pants, and a blue backpack, with short dark hair. In the center, a person is shown from the upper body, wearing a striped shirt, a white hat, and a red backpack. On the right, a person is visible from above the knees, wearing a blue jacket with a white and black pattern, and has short hair. The individuals are descending a stone staircase, with the person on the left leading the way. The focus is on their movement and attire, with the ancient stone surroundings providing context.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **This video is filmed in first person POV and follows three people walking in an ancient site. The person on the left is fully visible, the one in the center is shown the upper body, and the person on the right is visible from above the knees. The person takes up only half the height of the frame, leaving more content for the surroundings.**\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good for this video because it violates several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy and Completeness:**\n*   The description of the three individuals' clothing, accessories, and relative positions is mostly accurate and complete.\n*   The description of the man in the center as being \"shown from the upper body\" is slightly inaccurate, as his pants are also visible.\n*   Calling the location an \"ancient site\" is an assumption. While plausible, the instructions state to avoid describing what you are unsure about. A more objective description like \"narrow stone passage\" or \"corridor with stone block walls\" would be better.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violation of \"Describe only what is visible\":** The caption begins with \"The video, filmed in first-person POV, follows...\". This is a major violation. \"First-person POV\" is an analysis of the filmmaking technique, not a description of a visible subject in the scene.\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid meta-commentary\":** The first and last sentences (\"The video... follows...\" and \"The focus is on...\") are analytical comments about the video itself, rather than a direct description of the content. The instructions require a description of the subjects, not an analysis of the video's composition or focus.\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid terms like 'image' or 'frame'\":** The caption uses the word \"video,\" which falls into the category of meta-references to the medium that should be avoided.\n*   **Violation of \"Use precise terms\":** The caption uses the general term \"person.\" All three subjects appear to be men, so using the more specific term \"man\" would be more precise as per the instructions.\n\nIn summary, the caption fails because it includes significant meta-commentary and analysis, describing the filmmaking style and the video's \"focus\" instead of sticking strictly to an objective description of the visible subjects and their attributes. It also makes an assumption about the location and uses a less precise term for the subjects.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "Three men walk down a set of stairs inside a narrow passage with large, rough-hewn stone block walls, which are brightly lit by sunlight. On the left, a man in a bright orange t-shirt, black pants, and a blue backpack leads the way. In the center, a man with his back to the camera wears a gray and white striped t-shirt, a white fedora, patterned shorts, and a red backpack. To the right, a third man wears a blue and white windbreaker and black pants. They are descending into a darker area at the bottom of the stairs.",
