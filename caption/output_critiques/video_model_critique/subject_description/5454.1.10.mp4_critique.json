    "pre_caption": "The video features a diverse group of people standing on a bridge, viewed from below. They are leaning over a metal railing, with some gesturing or holding up their hands. The group includes individuals wearing a variety of clothing, such as jackets and hoodies, in different colors like brown, blue, and black. The people appear to be of different ages and genders, with varied hairstyles and skin tones. A sign on the bridge reads \"NO BALL GAMES.\" The overall scene conveys a sense of casual gathering or interaction among the group.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects with no clear main focus**. Because it does not emphasize any specific subject, please briefly describe the types of subjects without going into too much detail. You may also describe the subjects collectively as a group.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good for this video.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is inaccurate in its description of the subjects. It states the video features a \"diverse group of people\" of \"different ages and genders.\" However, the video clearly shows a group composed entirely of young men.\n*   The description of the location as a \"bridge\" is an assumption. It is more likely a balcony or an elevated walkway of a building, but this cannot be confirmed.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is missing the key detail that all visible subjects are men. While it mentions clothing and the \"NO BALL GAMES\" sign, this omission of the subjects' gender makes the description incomplete and misleading.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violation of Subject Type Precision:** The instructions require using precise terms like \"man\" or \"woman.\" The caption uses the vague term \"people\" and incorrectly infers the presence of multiple genders.\n*   **Violation of Objectivity:** The final sentence, \"The overall scene conveys a sense of casual gathering or interaction among the group,\" is a subjective interpretation of the mood and violates the instruction to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\"\n*   **Violation of Describing the Unseen:** By stating there are \"different genders,\" the caption describes something that is not visible and is factually incorrect for the scene, violating the rule to \"avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\"\n\nIn summary, the caption fails because it is factually inaccurate about the subjects' demographics and includes subjective interpretations, directly contradicting the core instructions provided.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a low-angle perspective, a group of young men stand on a balcony, looking down over a black metal railing. They are dressed in casual winter clothing, including jackets and hoodies. Below the railing, a white sign is affixed to the concrete, reading \"NO BALL GAMES\" in black text. Bare tree branches are visible against the overcast sky.",
