    "pre_caption": "The video features a man in a dimly lit setting. He has short, dark hair and is wearing a dark jacket over a sweater with a collared shirt underneath. The man appears to be interacting with a complex mechanical device, which has visible wires and components. He is positioned to the right, facing the device, and his posture suggests he is focused on it. The lighting casts a beam on him, highlighting his profile and the device. The scene conveys a sense of concentration and engagement with the machinery.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good because it is inaccurate, incomplete, and violates several key instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption inaccurately describes the man's actions. It states he \"appears to be interacting with a complex mechanical device\" and that the scene conveys \"concentration and engagement.\" This is incorrect. The man is shown violently and repeatedly striking something with an object, then sweeping items off the table in a fit of frustration or anger. Describing this as \"interacting\" or \"concentration\" is a significant misrepresentation of the events.\n*   The caption incorrectly states the man is \"positioned to the right.\" He is more centrally located in the frame, behind the foreground object.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is critically incomplete because it omits the most salient action in the entire video: the man's violent outburst. A description of the scene is not complete without mentioning that he is hitting something and knocking things over.\n*   It fails to mention the object in the man's hand that he uses to strike the surface.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   The caption violates the instruction to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The phrase \"conveys a sense of concentration and engagement\" is a subjective interpretation of the man's internal state and is also factually incorrect based on his actions.\n*   While the instructions advise against mentioning motion unless necessary, the man's violent actions are the defining feature of the scene and are essential for an accurate description of the subject. The caption's failure to describe this action makes it misleading.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a dimly lit room, a man with short, dark hair, wearing a dark jacket over a collared shirt, stands behind a workbench. In the foreground, a complex mechanical device with visible wires rests on the bench. The man holds a small, metallic object and repeatedly strikes the surface in front of him. He then sweeps his arm across the workbench, knocking items off of it. The scene is illuminated by a single, focused beam of light from above, and a yellow garment hangs on the wall in the background.",
