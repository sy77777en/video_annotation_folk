    "pre_caption": "The video features a large airplane with a distinctive design. The aircraft is predominantly white with a light blue stripe running along its fuselage. It has four engines, two on each wing, and a prominent tail fin. The nose of the plane is rounded, and the cockpit windows are visible. The landing gear is extended, indicating it is on the ground. The plane has a sleek, streamlined shape, and there are red lights on the top of the fuselage and the wingtips. The overall appearance suggests a modern, well-maintained aircraft.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good for the video.\n\n**Accuracy:** The description of the airplane's color scheme is inaccurate. The caption states the aircraft is \"predominantly white with a light blue stripe,\" which is incorrect. The aircraft has a white upper fuselage and a light blue lower fuselage, separated by a darker blue and gold stripe. The caption also fails to mention the prominent \"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\" text along the side, the American flag on the tail, and the presidential seal near the nose, which are the most defining visual characteristics of this specific aircraft.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is incomplete. By omitting the specific and highly recognizable markings (text, flag, and seal), it fails to capture the most essential information about the subject. These details are crucial for identifying the plane as Air Force One, which is its primary identity.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Subjective Adjectives:** The caption violates the instruction to \"avoid subjective adjectives\" by describing the plane's appearance as \"modern, well-maintained.\"\n*   **Key Visual Attributes:** It fails to adequately \"describe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language,\" specifically regarding the \"distinguishing features like texture or markings.\" The text and logos are critical markings that have been overlooked.\n*   **Conciseness vs. Information:** While the caption is concise, it sacrifices critical information for brevity, making it a poor description of the subject.\n\nIn summary, the caption is inaccurate in its color description, incomplete by omitting the most important identifying markings, and violates the rule against using subjective language. A better caption would accurately describe the full color scheme and include the specific text and symbols visible on the aircraft.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A wide, eye-level shot shows the US presidential aircraft, Air Force One, a modified Boeing 747, stationary on a dark, reflective surface against a black background. The aircraft's livery consists of a white upper fuselage and a light blue lower fuselage, separated by a dark blue and gold cheatline. The text \"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\" is written in large capital letters along the side. An American flag is on the tail fin, and the Seal of the President of the United States is near the nose. The plane's landing gear is down, and its four engines are visible. Red beacon lights on the fuselage and wingtips are illuminated.",
