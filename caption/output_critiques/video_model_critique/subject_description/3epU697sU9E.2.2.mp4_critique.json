    "pre_caption": "The video features a large airplane with a distinctive design. The aircraft is predominantly white with a light blue stripe running along its fuselage. It has four engines, two on each wing, and a prominent tail fin. The nose of the plane is rounded, and the cockpit windows are visible. The landing gear is extended, indicating it is on the ground. The plane has a sleek, streamlined shape, and there are red lights on the top of the fuselage and the wingtips. The overall appearance suggests a modern, well-maintained aircraft.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly states that the nose of the plane is painted in the darker blue color; it is actually the same light blue as the lower half of the fuselage. The description of the lights is incomplete, as it only mentions the red light on the bottom of the fuselage while omitting the flashing red light on top and the steady red lights on the wingtips. The caption also misses several key markings visible on the aircraft, including the \"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\" text along the side, the American flag on the tail fin, and the presidential seal near the front. Finally, the phrase \"well-maintained aircraft\" is a subjective assessment and should be removed to adhere to the instruction to avoid subjective adjectives.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video displays a large, four-engine airplane, identifiable as a Boeing 747 in the Air Force One livery, resting on the ground with its landing gear down. The aircraft's color scheme features a white upper fuselage and a light blue lower fuselage and nose. A darker blue stripe runs horizontally along the side, separating the white and light blue sections. Prominently displayed on the fuselage are the words \"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\" in large capital letters, the presidential seal near the front, and an American flag on the tail fin. The aircraft is equipped with a flashing red beacon light on top of the fuselage, steady red lights on the wingtips, and other red lights visible on its underside.",
