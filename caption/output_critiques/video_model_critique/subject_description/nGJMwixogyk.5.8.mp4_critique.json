    "pre_caption": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot capturing a traditional Japanese street. The scene features narrow, stone-paved pathways flanked by wooden buildings with tiled roofs, showcasing a blend of rustic charm and cultural architecture. Lanterns and signs adorn the structures, adding to the authentic atmosphere. Lush greenery, including bamboo and trees, lines the street, enhancing the serene and picturesque environment. The focus is on the overall ambiance and architectural details, rather than any specific object, highlighting the harmonious blend of nature and traditional design.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is mostly accurate in describing the video as a cityscape scenery shot of a traditional Japanese street, highlighting the stone-paved pathways, wooden buildings with tiled roofs, lanterns, signs, and greenery. However, it omits the presence of a white scooter parked near the building and a large closed pink umbrella, both of which are visually prominent and should be mentioned as part of the sceneâ€™s key visual attributes. Additionally, there are a few people visible in the distance on the street, and while they are not the main focus, their presence should be briefly noted to fully account for all salient subjects. The caption should be revised to include these missing elements for completeness and accuracy.",
