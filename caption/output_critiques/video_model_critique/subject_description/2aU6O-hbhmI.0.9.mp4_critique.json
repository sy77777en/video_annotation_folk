    "pre_caption": "The video presents a dynamic cityscape scenery shot, characterized by a low-angle, rotating perspective that sweeps across tall, modern buildings with reflective glass facades and prominent construction cranes silhouetted against a dramatic sky. The sky itself is a significant element, transitioning from a cool teal to warm hues of orange and pink, suggesting either sunrise or sunset. The absence of a singular main subject is due to the shot's emphasis on the overall urban environment, the atmospheric quality of the light and sky, and the sense of scale and movement, which collectively create an immersive experience of the city's architecture and ambiance rather than focusing on any individual element.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the video as a dynamic cityscape scenery shot and correctly describes the rotating perspective, construction cranes, and the colors of the sky. However, it misses a prominent visual attribute of the building on the left, which has distinct red vertical panels in addition to its glass facade. The use of the subjective adjective \"dramatic\" to describe the sky should be avoided. Furthermore, the final sentence is overly long and contains interpretive, subjective phrases such as \"immersive experience\" and \"ambiance,\" which are not permitted by the instructions. This sentence should be condensed to be a more concise and objective explanation for the absence of a main subject, focusing simply on the shot's emphasis on the urban environment, scale, and movement.",
