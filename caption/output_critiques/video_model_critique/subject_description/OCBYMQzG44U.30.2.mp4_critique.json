    "pre_caption": "This video presents a surreal indoor scenery shot, capturing a disorienting journey through a liminal space. The sequence begins in a sterile, green-lit room with white tiled walls, looking down the mouth of a vibrant red water slide. The perspective then plunges into the dark, enclosed tube of the slide, a tight, reddish-brown tunnel that opens toward a bright light. The camera emerges at water level into a long, narrow, flooded hallway, also lined with white tiles and small, high windows. The murky green water is populated by several colorful, abandoned-looking pool floats, including a yellow ring, a purple tube, and an orange inflatable animal. The video lacks a main subject, instead using the first-person perspective to immerse the viewer in the strange and unsettling atmosphere of the environment itself.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains subjective and interpretive language, such as \"surreal,\" \"disorienting,\" \"liminal space,\" \"sterile,\" \"vibrant,\" \"abandoned-looking,\" \"strange,\" and \"unsettling,\" which violates the instruction to avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. The description of the pool floats is inaccurate; it mentions \"two orange rings,\" but one of the orange floats is distinctly animal-shaped, a detail that has been omitted. Furthermore, the final sentence is overly interpretive and should be revised to objectively state that the video is a scenery shot focused on the environment from a first-person perspective, without mentioning \"viewer immersion\" or \"atmosphere.\"",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video shows an indoor environment from a first-person perspective, following a path from a room with a water slide into a flooded hallway. The video starts in a green-lit room with white tiled walls, with the camera positioned at the entrance of a red water slide, looking down. The camera's point of view moves through the dark, enclosed, reddish-brown interior of the slide, which leads toward a bright, circular opening. The view emerges at water level in a long, narrow, flooded hallway lined with white tiles and featuring small windows high on the walls. The green-tinted water contains several colorful pool floats: a yellow ring, a purple ring, and an orange animal-shaped float. The video is a scenery shot that focuses on the environment from a first-person point of view.",
