    "pre_caption": "The video presents a night-time forest scenery shot, where the focus is on the ethereal atmosphere created by numerous small, glowing orbs rather than a specific subject. These orbs, predominantly bright white with a few interspersed blue ones, are scattered throughout the dark environment, illuminating the silhouettes of tall, indistinct trees and the dimly lit ground. The scene is characterized by a strong contrast between these point-like lights and the surrounding darkness, with the overall effect being one of a mysterious and enchanting nocturnal woodland. The absence of a central subject directs attention to the overall mood and the distribution of these luminous particles.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption fails to describe the salient on-screen graphics from the video game's Heads-Up Display (HUD). It omits the circular gauge in the top-left corner, which displays \"O2\" and \"FUEL\" levels around a silhouette of a person. It also misses the crosshair and \"GRAVITY 0.4x\" text in the bottom-left, as well as the text prompts (\"Equip Scout Launcher,\" \"Equip Signalscope,\" \"View Map\") in the top-right corner. Additionally, the caption uses subjective adjectives such as \"ethereal,\" \"mysterious,\" and \"enchanting,\" which should be removed to maintain objectivity as per the instructions. The final two sentences are also redundant and should be condensed.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is a first-person perspective from a video game, set within a dark forest at night. The scene is filled with numerous small, glowing orbs, which are mostly bright white with a few blue ones interspersed. These orbs are scattered among the silhouettes of large trees. The game's Heads-Up Display (HUD) is visible on screen. In the top-left corner, a circular gauge displays \"O2\" and \"FUEL\" levels, both at 100.0%, around a silhouette of a person. The bottom-left corner shows a green crosshair and the text \"GRAVITY 0.4x\". In the top-right corner, text prompts are listed: \"Equip Scout Launcher,\" \"Equip Signalscope,\" and \"View Map.\"",
