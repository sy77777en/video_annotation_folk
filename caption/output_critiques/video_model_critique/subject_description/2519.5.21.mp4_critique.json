    "pre_caption": "The video features two individuals, a man and a boy, engaged in a close interaction. The man, with gray hair and a lined face, wears a dark green sweater over a collared shirt. He appears to be middle-aged and is facing the boy, showing a range of expressions from contemplative to slightly smiling. The boy, with short dark hair, is seen from the back and side, wearing a white shirt with a dark collar. Their proximity suggests a conversation or moment of connection, with the man looking at the boy attentively.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption is well-written and captures the essence of the scene. Here is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the provided instructions.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. The physical descriptions of both the man (gray hair, lined face, dark green sweater over a collared shirt) and the boy (short dark hair, white shirt with a dark collar) are correct. The description of their positioning and interaction (close proximity, man facing and looking at the boy) is also precise.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe description is very complete. It successfully identifies and describes the two main subjects, their key visual attributes, their clothing, and their spatial relationship. It correctly focuses on the subjects as instructed, providing enough detail for a reader to visualize the scene.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption adheres to most instructions well, but there are a few key areas where it deviates.\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n    *   It correctly identifies subject types (\"man,\" \"boy\").\n    *   It provides detailed visual attributes (clothing, hair, etc.).\n    *   It avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   It correctly prioritizes the man, who is more visually prominent.\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   The primary issue is the use of subjective and interpretive language, which violates the instruction: \"**You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions**\" and \"**avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.**\"\n        *   **\"contemplative\"**: This word describes the man's internal state of mind, which is an interpretation, not a direct visual observation. A more objective description would focus on his physical expression, such as \"his brow is furrowed\" or \"he looks downward before meeting the boy's gaze.\"\n        *   **\"moment of connection\"**: This is a subjective interpretation of the relationship and the emotional tone of the scene. It describes something intangible that is suggested rather than explicitly seen.\n        *   **\"attentively\"**: This adverb describes the quality of the man's looking, implying a mental state of attention. A more neutral description would be \"the man looks directly at the boy.\"\n\n### Summary\n\nThe caption is excellent in its description of concrete, visual details. Its main weakness is the inclusion of subjective interpretations of emotion and internal states. By replacing words like \"contemplative,\" \"connection,\" and \"attentively\" with more objective descriptions of physical actions and expressions, the caption would fully align with all instructions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features a man and a boy standing close together in a dimly lit room. The man has graying, wavy hair, a lined face, and wears a dark green V-neck sweater over a collared shirt. He is facing the boy. At first, the man's head is bowed as he looks downward, but he then raises his face to look directly at the boy. The boy, shown from the back and side, has short dark hair and is wearing a white shirt with a dark collar. The camera focuses on the man's face as he holds his gaze on the boy.",
