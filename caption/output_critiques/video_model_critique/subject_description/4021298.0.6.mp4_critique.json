    "pre_caption": "The video reveals a scene featuring several camels and a group of people in a rocky, mountainous area. The camels are adorned with colorful, decorative tassels and blankets, adding vibrant hues to their natural brown tones. One camel, prominently positioned, has a close-up shot that highlights its face and decorative harness. The people, dressed in varied traditional attire, including headscarves and long garments, are gathered near the camels. One man wears a red jacket, while another is in a dark coat with a patterned headscarf. The setting suggests a cultural or tourist activity, with the camels and people interacting in a natural, outdoor environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the subject is revealed through either subject movement or camera movement.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "**Feedback on the Caption:**\n\nThe provided caption is generally good, but it has a few areas where it deviates from the instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subjects as camels and people, their specific attire and decorations (colorful tassels, blankets, red jacket, headscarves), and the rocky, mountainous setting.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The description is quite complete, covering the most salient aspects of the video. It mentions the group of people, the decorated camels, and the shift in focus to a close-up of one camel.\n*   To be even more complete, it could have mentioned the specific, vibrant colors of the tassels (red, blue, yellow, green) and the small tuft of black hair on the close-up camel's head, which are prominent details.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   The caption successfully provides a concise, one-paragraph description.\n    *   It uses precise terms for subjects (\"camels,\" \"man\").\n    *   It effectively uses visual attributes to distinguish between subjects (e.g., \"One man wears a red jacket\").\n    *   It correctly identifies the main subjects and describes them.\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   The instruction states, \"You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\" The final sentence, \"The setting suggests a cultural or tourist activity,\" is an interpretation of the scene's context, not a direct visual description. The caption should only describe what is visually present.\n    *   The phrase \"has a close-up shot\" is a description of a cinematographic technique. While it conveys the right idea, a more direct description of the visual experience would be better, such as \"The view shifts to a close-up of one camel's face...\" or \"One camel is shown in close-up...\" to keep the focus on the subjects themselves rather than the filmmaking process.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is strong in its accuracy and descriptive detail but violates the rule against making interpretations. By removing the final sentence and slightly rephrasing the part about the close-up, it would perfectly align with all instructions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A group of people and several camels are gathered in a rocky, mountainous area under a clear sky. The camels are adorned with colorful blankets and decorative harnesses featuring red, blue, yellow, and green tassels. The people are dressed in various garments, including headscarves; one man wears a red jacket, and another is in a dark coat. The view then focuses on a close-up of one camel's face, which is decorated with a harness and a small tuft of black hair tied on its head, as it looks toward the camera. In the background, a vast expanse of rugged mountain peaks is visible.",
