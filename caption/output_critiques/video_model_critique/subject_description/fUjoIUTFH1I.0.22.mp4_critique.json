    "pre_caption": "This video presents a moody cityscape scenery shot of a street in New Orleans on an overcast day. The perspective is from a wide, wet stone sidewalk bordered on the left by a tall, black wrought-iron fence and lush trees, including a palm tree. On the right, the street is lined with parked vehicles, most notably a large white Penske rental truck, and features a row of classic, colorful buildings with ornate balconies. The shot lacks a single main subject, as the focus is deliberately placed on the overall environment to capture the city's distinct atmosphere and architectural charm. The few pedestrians walking along the sidewalk serve only to add a sense of scale and life to the scene rather than acting as a focal point.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption should be revised to remove subjective and interpretive language. The instruction states to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions,\" making the word \"moody\" inappropriate. Additionally, the final two sentences interpret the filmmaker's intent (e.g., \"the focus is deliberately placed,\" \"to capture the city's distinct atmosphere and architectural charm,\" \"serve only to add a sense of scale\") rather than describing the visible content. The explanation for why it's a scenery shot should be more concise and descriptive. A better approach would be to state that the wide composition focuses on the overall environment, with the few pedestrians and vehicles appearing as secondary elements within the larger street scene rather than as primary subjects.",
