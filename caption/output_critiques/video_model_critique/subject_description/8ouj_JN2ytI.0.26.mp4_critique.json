    "pre_caption": "The video's main focus is a series of large, bright orange and yellow explosions erupting in an urban street, sending plumes of dark grey and black smoke billowing upwards, accompanied by flying sparks and fiery debris. Several cars are present in the affected area: a silver sedan in the foreground appears relatively intact, while further up the street, a yellow taxi cab and a red car are surrounded by smoke and debris and appear damaged. On the right side of the street, a dark-colored SUV or truck is overturned or heavily damaged, positioned near large bales of compressed material, possibly cardboard or paper. The street is extensively littered with scattered papers, pieces of metal, wood, and other fragments. Multi-story industrial-style buildings with numerous windows, some of which are broken, line both sides of the street; the building on the left features fire escapes, and the one on the right has loading docks.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with one clear main focus**, so you need to clarify who the main subject is. The description should focus on the details of the main subject while concisely summarizing secondary subjects and describing their relationship to the main subject if clear.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption adheres to all instructions and provides a high-quality description of the video.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate.\n*   It correctly identifies the primary action as a \"series of large, bright orange and yellow explosions.\"\n*   It accurately describes the resulting \"plumes of dark grey and black smoke,\" \"flying sparks,\" and \"fiery debris.\"\n*   The descriptions of the vehicles are precise: the \"silver sedan in the foreground\" is relatively intact, while the \"yellow taxi cab,\" \"red car,\" and \"dark-colored SUV or truck\" are correctly identified as being in the midst of the chaos and appearing damaged or overturned.\n*   The description of the surrounding environment, including the littered street and the \"industrial-style buildings\" with \"broken windows,\" \"fire escapes,\" and \"loading docks,\" is spot-on.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete.\n*   It covers the main event (explosions), the key subjects affected by the event (cars), and the background scenery (buildings, street condition).\n*   It provides enough detail on each element to create a clear mental image of the scene without becoming overly long or cluttered.\n*   The mention of the \"large bales of compressed material\" adds a specific detail that enhances the description of the industrial setting.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows all provided instructions perfectly.\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The description is direct and packed with relevant information.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It uses precise terms like \"sedan,\" \"taxi cab,\" \"SUV or truck,\" and \"buildings\" instead of vague language.\n*   **Visual Attributes:** It excels at describing visual attributes, such as the colors of the cars and explosions, the state of the vehicles (intact, damaged, overturned), and the architectural features of the buildings.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It avoids words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" or \"video.\"\n*   **Objectivity:** The language is descriptive and objective, avoiding subjective or emotional adjectives.\n*   **Structure and Flow:** It is a single, coherent paragraph that flows logically, starting with the most prominent action (the explosions) and then moving to other subjects in a clear order.\n*   **Handling Uncertainty:** The phrase \"possibly cardboard or paper\" is an excellent example of adhering to the instruction to avoid stating uncertainties as facts.\n*   **Distinguishing Subjects:** It effectively uses location (\"in the foreground,\" \"on the right side\") and color (\"silver,\" \"yellow,\" \"red\") to distinguish between the multiple cars.\n\nThe caption is an exemplary model of how to follow the given instructions to produce a clear, accurate, and detailed description.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a high-angle view, a series of large, bright orange and yellow explosions rock a debris-strewn urban street. Plumes of dark grey and black smoke, sparks, and fiery debris billow upwards between multi-story industrial buildings. The street is littered with papers, wreckage, and damaged vehicles. In the foreground, a silver sedan appears intact. Further down, a yellow taxi cab is engulfed in an explosion, a red car is surrounded by smoke, and a dark SUV is overturned next to large bales of compressed material. The buildings feature numerous windows, some broken, with fire escapes on the left and loading docks on the right.",
