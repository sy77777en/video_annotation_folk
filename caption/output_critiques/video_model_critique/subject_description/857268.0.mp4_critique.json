    "pre_caption": "The video features a man and a woman walking side by side along a narrow, sandy beach with clear, shallow water on either side. The man, on the right, is wearing a dark t-shirt and shorts, while the woman, on the left, is dressed in a black tank top and shorts. Both are barefoot, leaving footprints in the sand as they walk. Their shadows are cast on the sand, indicating the sun is overhead. In the distance, two more people are visible, walking further along the beach. The scene conveys a sense of leisure and tranquility.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "**Feedback on the Caption:**\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies a man and a woman as the main subjects, their relative positions, their action of walking, and their attire (dark t-shirt and shorts for the man, black top and shorts for the woman). The description of the setting as a \"narrow, sandy beach with clear, shallow water on either side\" is a perfect depiction of the sandbar. The mention of them being barefoot, leaving footprints, and the presence of other people in the distance is also correct.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is very complete. It covers all the salient subjects and their most important visual attributes and actions. It successfully paints a full picture of the scene shown in the video, including details like the shadows and footprints which add to the visual description.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows most of the instructions well, such as being a concise paragraph, using simple language, and focusing on objective visual details. However, it fails on one critical point:\n\n*   **Violation:** The instruction states, \"**You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.**\" The last sentence of the caption, \"The scene conveys a sense of leisure and tranquility,\" directly violates this rule. \"Leisure\" and \"tranquility\" are subjective interpretations of the mood and are not objective visual descriptions.\n\n**Conclusion:** The caption is excellent in terms of accuracy and completeness but needs to be revised to remove the final subjective sentence to fully adhere to all instructions.",
