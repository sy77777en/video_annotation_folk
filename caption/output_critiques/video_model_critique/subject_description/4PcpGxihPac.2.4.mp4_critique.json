    "pre_caption": "A middle-aged, light-skinned man with a full, dark beard and mustache is shown in a close-up. His face is covered in what appears to be red blood, with cuts and abrasions visible on his forehead and cheeks. His dark hair is unkempt. He stares forward with wide, dark eyes and an intense expression, his mouth slightly open. He wears a light-colored, worn-looking garment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "**Feedback on the Caption:**\n\nThe provided caption is excellent and adheres very well to the given instructions.\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subject as a middle-aged, light-skinned man and precisely details his physical state, including the full beard, unkempt hair, and the blood and abrasions on his face. The description of his gaze, open mouth, and clothing is also spot-on.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is very complete. It captures all the essential visual information in the close-up shot. It details the subject's appearance, facial features, expression, and clothing, leaving out no significant details. The use of \"appears to be red blood\" is a good choice, as it describes what is visible without making an unverified claim.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is a single, well-written paragraph that is both concise and easy to understand.\n    *   **Objectivity:** It successfully avoids subjective emotional language. While \"intense expression\" is used, it serves as a factual description of his physical features (wide eyes, fixed stare) rather than an interpretation of his feelings (e.g., \"scared\" or \"angry\").\n    *   **Detail:** It provides the specific level of detail requested, covering attributes like skin tone, facial hair, and the condition of his face and clothing.\n    *   **Formatting:** The output is a single paragraph without any introductory text or markdown, as instructed.\n    *   **Focus:** The description correctly focuses entirely on the main subject, as he is the sole focus of the video.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the instructions. It is accurate, thorough, objective, and well-structured. No improvements are necessary.",
