    "pre_caption": "The video features a man in a black suit with a white dress shirt, who is the main subject. He appears to be in his 30s, with short dark hair, and is shown in an action-oriented pose, breaking through a large glass window. His expression is focused and determined. The video captures him with arms raised, emphasizing the dynamic movement as he moves through the shattered glass. In the background, there are two other men; one is partially visible, wearing a light-colored jacket, and appears to be turning away from the action, while the other is bent over a table, possibly reacting to the commotion. The scene conveys a sense of urgency and dramatic action centered around the main subject.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with one clear main focus**, so you need to clarify who the main subject is. The description should focus on the details of the main subject while concisely summarizing secondary subjects and describing their relationship to the main subject if clear.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description of the main subject's clothing (\"black suit with a white dress shirt\") and physical appearance (\"in his 30s, with short dark hair\") is accurate.\n*   The description of his action (\"breaking through a large glass window\") is generally correct.\n*   The description of his expression as \"focused and determined\" is inaccurate. His face is contorted in what appears to be a grimace or a shout, not a look of calm focus.\n*   The caption mentions \"two other men,\" but it misses the most visible background figure: a person in a red shirt on the right side of the scene. It correctly identifies a man bent over a table and another in a light-colored jacket, but the person in red is more prominent than the one in the light jacket.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption fails to mention a crucial and highly prominent visual element: the massive amount of water that gushes into the room as the glass shatters. The water splashes all over the main subject and floods the foreground, which is a key part of the action.\n*   While it mentions the shattered glass, it omits the water, making the description of the event incomplete.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions\":** The caption uses \"focused and determined\" to describe the man's expression, which is a subjective interpretation of his emotional state. It also concludes with \"The scene conveys a sense of urgency and dramatic action,\" which describes the mood of the scene rather than its objective visual content. The instructions explicitly state to avoid this.\n*   **Violation of \"Describe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language\":** By omitting the gushing water, the caption fails to describe a key attribute of the action and the environment.\n*   The caption correctly follows the instructions to be a single paragraph, avoid terms like \"image,\" prioritize the main subject, and use simple English.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption makes a good attempt to describe the main subject and the general action. However, it has significant flaws in accuracy and completeness. The inaccurate description of the man's expression and the subjective interpretation of the scene's mood directly violate the provided instructions. Most importantly, the complete omission of the gushing water leaves out a critical component of the video, fundamentally misrepresenting the event taking place.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A man with short dark hair, wearing a black suit and a white dress shirt, is captured mid-air as he comes through a large, shattering pane of glass. His arms are raised and his mouth is open. As the glass breaks, a large volume of water gushes into the room, splashing around him. In the background to the right, a person in a red shirt is near a table, and another person is bent over the same table. A third individual in a light-colored jacket is partially visible behind the main subject. The setting appears to be an indoor area with dark green curtains.",
