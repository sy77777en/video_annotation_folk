The camera pans around, revealing a furnished space with a bed covered in a patterned duvet, a small kitchenette area with a counter and stools, a blue chest of drawers, a grey armchair, and a grey sofa. The yurt's structure, with its wooden lattice walls and radial roof beams, is visible throughout. There is no main subject as the focus is on capturing the overall environment, atmosphere, and layout of the yurt's interior rather than a specific object or person.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the video as an interior scenery shot of a yurt and correctly describes the main furnishings and structural elements. However, the final sentence, \"Towards the end of the video, a portion of a hand briefly appears in the bottom left corner of the frame,\" should be removed. The hand is a non-salient, fleeting element that is not a subject of the video. Its inclusion is unnecessary and distracts from the description of the scenery, which is the intended focus.",
