    "pre_caption": "The video takes place in an office setting, featuring a screen hanging from the ceiling displaying a news broadcast. Initially, the screen is the main focus, showing an image with text at the bottom. As the camera zooms out, two people become visible in the foreground. The person in the lower-left corner has short, dark hair and a light skin tone, while the person in the lower-right corner has short hair and a light skin tone. Both are looking at the screen. The office environment includes desks and overhead lighting, contributing to the professional atmosphere.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video takes place in an office setting, where two people are looking at a screen hanging from the ceiling. The scene begins with a full shot of the screen, and then the camera zooms out to reveal the two people in the foreground, with only their heads visible. One is positioned in the lower-left corner, and the other in the lower-right corner of the frame.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is a good attempt but has several areas for improvement regarding accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is mostly accurate in its description of the scene's progression from a close-up on the screen to a wider view including two people.\n*   However, it refers to the foreground subjects as \"people.\" Based on their haircuts and builds, they are more specifically identifiable as men.\n*   Describing the content on the screen as an \"image\" is inaccurate; it is clearly video footage, specifically news footage showing smoke billowing from a tall building.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The description of the two foreground subjects is incomplete. It omits key distinguishing features: the man on the left wears a light-colored plaid shirt, and the man on the right wears glasses and a light blue collared shirt.\n*   The description of the screen is also lacking. It could be more specific, noting that it is an older, boxy CRT-style television monitor.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violation:** The caption uses the word \"image,\" which is explicitly forbidden by the instructions.\n*   **Violation:** The phrase \"contributing to the professional atmosphere\" is a subjective interpretation, not a direct visual description. The instructions state to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\"\n*   **Needs Improvement:** The instruction to \"describe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language\" is not fully met, as evidenced by the missing details about the men's clothing and glasses. The description should focus only on what is visually present.\n\n**Revised Caption Example:**\n\nIn an office with a drop-tile ceiling and fluorescent lights, a boxy, CRT-style television hangs from the ceiling. It displays news footage of smoke billowing from a tall building, with a news ticker visible at the bottom of the screen. As the camera pulls back, the backs of two men in the foreground become visible. The man on the left has short, dark hair and wears a light-colored plaid shirt. The man on the right has short, dark hair, wears glasses, and is dressed in a light blue collared shirt. Both men are looking up at the television. In the background, other office workers and cubicles are visible.",
