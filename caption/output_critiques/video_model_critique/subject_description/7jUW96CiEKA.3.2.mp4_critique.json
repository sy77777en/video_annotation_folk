    "pre_caption": "The video features a bird with a distinctive appearance, characterized by a gray body, white underparts, and black markings on its wings. It has a yellow beak and long, slender legs, which are pale in color. The bird is seen standing and walking on a muddy surface, suggesting it is in a wetland or similar environment. Its posture is upright, and it appears to be foraging or exploring the area. The bird's head is turned slightly, indicating alertness or curiosity.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Feedback on the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is mostly accurate but contains a significant inaccuracy and omission regarding the bird's facial features. While it correctly mentions a \"yellow beak,\" the most prominent feature is the large, fleshy yellow wattle that surrounds the eye and extends to the base of the beak. The beak itself has a black tip, which is not mentioned. The rest of the description of the bird's plumage (gray body, white underparts, black wing markings), legs, and environment is correct.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is incomplete because it fails to describe the most distinctive visual attribute of the bird: the yellow facial wattle. This is a key identifying feature, and its omission makes the description less thorough than it should be.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is well-written, concise, and easy to understand.\n*   **Subject Focus:** It correctly focuses on the main subject (the bird) and its actions.\n*   **Visual Attributes:** It adheres to this instruction for the body and legs but fails significantly in describing the head and beak accurately and completely.\n*   **Formatting:** It correctly provides a single, coherent paragraph without introductory text or markdown.\n*   **Objectivity:** The caption is mostly objective, using acceptable terms like \"alertness\" to describe the bird's posture and behavior.\n\n**Overall Assessment:** The caption provides a good general description but fails on a crucial detail. To be fully compliant and accurate, it must include a description of the prominent yellow facial wattle and correctly describe the beak as having a black tip.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features a bird with a gray head and body, white underparts, and black markings on its wings. A prominent, fleshy yellow wattle surrounds its eye and extends to the base of its beak, which is yellow with a black tip. The bird has long, slender, pale-colored legs. It is seen walking carefully across a wet, muddy surface, suggesting a wetland environment. Its upright posture and deliberate steps indicate it may be foraging or navigating the uneven terrain.",
