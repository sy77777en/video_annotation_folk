Each pair of smooth, matte-finished hands is positioned over a black, rectangular keyboard with teal-green backlit keys. In some instances, a black, modern computer mouse with matching teal-green accents sits to the side of a keyboard. The setups are arranged in a grid-like pattern, with each station illuminated by a circular spotlight against a completely dark background, creating the impression of an endless, uniform workforce.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is well-written and adheres to all instructions.\n\n### Feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is perfectly accurate. It correctly identifies all the visual elements: the \"disembodied, stylized white hands,\" the \"black keyboards with teal-green backlit keys,\" and the \"black, modern computer mouse.\" The description of the action (\"actively typing\") and the visual characteristics (\"smooth, matte-finished,\" \"rectangular\") are precise.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is comprehensive. It not only details the individual components of each station but also accurately describes their collective arrangement (\"vast, organized array,\" \"grid-like pattern\"), the specific lighting (\"circular spotlight\"), and the dark background. It successfully captures the scale and uniformity that define the scene.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows the provided guidelines exceptionally well.\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a rich description in a single, fluent paragraph.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** It focuses entirely on the subjects and their key attributes without unnecessary speculation.\n*   **Objective Language:** It uses descriptive, objective language. The final phrase, \"creating the impression of an endless, uniform workforce,\" is an acceptable interpretation of the visual composition's effect rather than a subjective emotional adjective. It describes what the visual arrangement suggests, which is a key part of the scene's content.\n*   **Formatting and Structure:** It is a single paragraph, uses natural English, and correctly describes the subjects collectively as a group, which is the most effective approach for this video.\n\nThe caption is an exemplary model of how to follow the instructions to produce a clear, detailed, and accurate description.",
