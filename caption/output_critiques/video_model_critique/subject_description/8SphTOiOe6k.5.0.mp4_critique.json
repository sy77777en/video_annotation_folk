Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "This is a poor caption. It misinterprets the core instructions by incorrectly classifying the video and failing to describe the prominent subjects as required.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption incorrectly identifies the video as a \"cityscape scenery shot\" where the \"focus is on the environment and atmosphere... rather than a specific object.\" This is inaccurate. The video has several clear and salient subjects, most notably the two women in kimonos who are centrally located and visually distinct. The instructions state to describe the scenery only when there are *no* salient subjects. This video clearly has them.\n*   The description of the architecture as \"traditional... wooden buildings with tiled roofs\" is accurate.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is severely incomplete. It fails to describe the main subjects in any detail. The instructions require describing key visual attributes like clothing color and style, pose, and grouping.\n*   It does not mention the two women in kimonos, their specific colors (one pink, one dark red/maroon), or that they are standing together looking at a sign.\n*   It does not mention the group of what appear to be schoolgirls in dark uniforms and grey skirts.\n*   It does not mention the man in the light-colored jacket walking on the left.\n*   By generalizing all the people into a vague group, the caption misses the most important visual information in the video.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violation of Subject Focus:** The caption directly violates the instruction: \"If the video features salient human or non-human subjects, focus your description on them.\" It does the opposite, focusing on the background and atmosphere.\n*   **Violation of Subjective Language:** The caption uses numerous subjective and emotional adjectives, which are explicitly forbidden. Words like \"bustling,\" \"vibrant,\" \"lively,\" \"dynamic,\" \"rich,\" and \"immersive\" all violate the rule to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\"\n*   **Violation of Detail Requirement:** The caption fails to \"describe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language\" for the people present. A generic mention of \"people... some wearing traditional attire\" is insufficient and does not meet the required level of detail.\n*   **Violation of Subject Identification:** The caption does not \"clearly identify each subjectâ€™s type\" or \"distinguish them using unique appearance traits,\" as instructed.\n\nIn summary, the caption fails on almost every key instruction. It misclassifies the video type, ignores the main subjects, lacks the required detail, and is filled with forbidden subjective language. It needs to be completely rewritten to focus on objectively describing the specific people in the scene, their attire, and their actions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is a street-level, eye-level shot in what appears to be a Japanese town. In the center-right, two women stand with their backs to the camera, looking at signs in front of a shop. One woman wears a pink floral kimono with a light-colored obi, and the other wears a dark red patterned kimono, also with a light-colored obi.\n\nTo their left, a group of several schoolgirls in dark long-sleeved tops and grey pleated skirts are gathered on the sidewalk. Some of them are carrying backpacks.\n\nOn the left side of the frame, a man in a light-colored jacket, dark pants, and a white face mask walks away from the camera. Further to the left, another person in a dark hat and dark clothing walks towards the camera.\n\nThe background consists of buildings with traditional Japanese architecture, featuring dark tiled roofs and wooden facades. A tree with red leaves is on the far right. The street is paved, and the sky is overcast.",
