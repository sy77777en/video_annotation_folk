    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

The instruction states, \"If the video features salient human or non-human subjects, focus your description on them.\" This video clearly features several prominent human subjects in the foreground and midground whose actions and appearances should be described.\n\nThe caption is missing descriptions of these key subjects, including: a man in a white shirt and face mask walking toward the camera, another man in a light blue shirt and face mask handling a cardboard box, a green delivery tricycle with purple crates, and a white delivery truck on the right.\n\nFurthermore, the caption includes speculative and subjective phrases such as \"likely serves as an establishing shot\" and \"overall vibe of the area,\" which should be avoided according to the instructions.\n\nThe caption should be rewritten to provide a concise, objective description of the people and vehicles on the street, detailing their appearance and actions as the primary focus.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is a daytime, eye-level shot of a city street in Kyoto, Japan. In the center, a man in a white shirt and face mask walks along the sidewalk toward the camera. To his left, a green delivery tricycle with purple crates is parked. To the right, another man in a light blue shirt and face mask picks up a cardboard box. A white delivery truck is parked on the right side of the frame, with another person visible in its open back. In the background is the entrance to Gojo Station, with other pedestrians, buildings, and a clear blue sky visible.",
