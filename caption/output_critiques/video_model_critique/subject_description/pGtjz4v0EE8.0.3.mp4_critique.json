    "pre_caption": "This video presents a vibrant cityscape scenery shot, capturing a journey along the bustling Grand Canal in Venice, Italy. There is no single main subject, as the camera's movement through the environment emphasizes the overall atmosphere and grand scale of the iconic waterway and its architecture. The deep blue water ripples with the traffic of numerous vessels, including a traditional gondola being rowed, sleek white motorboats, a larger water taxi, and a distinctive blue and white police boat. Lining both sides of the canal are historic, multi-story buildings with a mix of white, orange, and yellow facades, featuring arched windows and terracotta-tiled roofs, all set against a clear, bright blue sky.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the video as a cityscape scenery shot and explains the lack of a main subject. However, it uses several subjective adjectives such as \"vibrant,\" \"bustling,\" \"grand,\" \"iconic,\" \"sleek,\" and \"distinctive,\" which should be replaced with more objective descriptions or removed to adhere to the instructions. For instance, instead of \"bustling Grand Canal,\" you could describe it as \"the Grand Canal with numerous boats.\" Additionally, the instruction for scenery shots calls for a concise description of one to three sentences. The current four-sentence paragraph, while accurate, could be condensed by combining the descriptions of the water, boats, and buildings into a more succinct summary to better align with the conciseness requirement.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This cityscape scenery shot captures a journey along the Grand Canal in Venice, Italy, where the blue water is filled with numerous boats, including gondolas, motorboats, and a police boat. The canal is flanked on both sides by multi-story historic buildings with white, orange, and yellow facades and terracotta-tiled roofs. The scene takes place under a clear blue sky.",
