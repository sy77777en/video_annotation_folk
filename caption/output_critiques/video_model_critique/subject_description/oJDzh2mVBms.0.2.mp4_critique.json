    "pre_caption": "This video is an astronomical time-lapse scenery shot capturing a spectacular celestial event in a remote, snowy landscape. There is no single main subject, as the focus is on the immense scale and atmosphere of the natural light show in the sky, with a small, white research station serving as a point of reference. A vibrant aurora borealis, with prominent green and subtle red hues, dances in a massive, shifting arc across the star-dusted heavens. The dense, glowing band of the Milky Way is also visible, stretching across the sky alongside the dynamic aurora, creating a breathtaking cosmic display.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains subjective adjectives such as \"spectacular\" and \"breathtaking,\" which should be removed to adhere to the instruction to avoid words that convey emotion. The description of the scenery is incomplete; it omits the evergreen trees surrounding the building and fails to mention the visible satellite dish and antenna on the research station. Additionally, the final phrase, \"creating a breathtaking cosmic display,\" is redundant and should be deleted for conciseness.",

In the foreground, a small, white research station with a satellite dish and an antenna is situated among evergreen trees and piles of snow. In the sky, an aurora borealis with green and red hues moves in a large, shifting arc. The dense, glowing band of the Milky Way is also visible, stretching across the star-filled sky alongside the dynamic aurora.",
