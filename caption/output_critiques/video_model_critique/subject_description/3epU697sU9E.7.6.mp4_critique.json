    "pre_caption": "The video features a man in a dark suit standing at a wooden podium, appearing to address a group of people. He has short, gray hair and is facing the audience, suggesting he is the main subject. To his right, there are two flags, one of which is the American flag. In front of him, a woman with light hair, wearing a white shirt, is holding a microphone towards him, indicating a press event. Several other individuals, including photographers and journalists, are gathered around, some holding cameras and recording equipment. The setting appears to be a formal room with framed portraits on the walls, contributing to the official atmosphere.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with one clear main focus**, so you need to clarify who the main subject is. The description should focus on the details of the main subject while concisely summarizing secondary subjects and describing their relationship to the main subject if clear.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on this caption. It is well-structured, accurate, and captures the main elements of the scene effectively. Here is a detailed breakdown of your caption against the provided instructions.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy & Completeness:**\n*   **Excellent:** The description of the subjects and their actions is highly accurate. You correctly identify the man at the podium, the woman with the microphone, the surrounding crowd, and key objects like the flags and portraits.\n*   **Good:** The caption provides a good level of detail for the main subjects, including clothing, hair color, and posture.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Subject Identification:** You have successfully used precise terms like \"man\" and \"woman\" and distinguished them by their appearance and actions (e.g., \"man in a dark suit,\" \"woman with light hair... holding a microphone\").\n*   **Visual Attributes:** The description of visual attributes like the \"dark suit,\" \"wooden podium,\" \"light hair,\" and \"white shirt\" is well done.\n*   **Structure and Flow:** The paragraph is coherent and logically structured, starting with the main subject and expanding to the surrounding environment.\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise while remaining informative.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n*   **Avoid Interpretation and Subjectivity:** The instructions state to \"avoid describing what is not visible\" and \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" Your caption includes a few phrases that are interpretations rather than direct visual descriptions:\n    *   \"...**suggesting** he is the main subject\": While true, this is an analysis of the composition rather than a description of it.\n    *   \"...**indicating** a press event\": This is a correct inference based on the visual cues (cameras, microphones), but it is still an interpretation of the event's nature.\n    *   \"...including **photographers and journalists**...\": This assigns professions to the people, which is an assumption. A more neutral description would be \"people holding cameras and recording equipment.\"\n    *   \"...**contributing to the official atmosphere**\": This describes a mood or feeling, which is subjective. The instruction is to describe the visual elements that create this feeling (e.g., \"framed portraits on the walls\"), which you have done, but the conclusion about the \"atmosphere\" should be omitted.\n\n### Revised Caption Example\n\nHere is an example of how the caption could be revised to adhere more strictly to the instructions by removing interpretations:\n\n\"The video features a man with short, gray hair in a dark suit standing at a wooden podium. He is facing a group of people. In the foreground, a woman with light hair, wearing a white shirt, extends a microphone on a pole toward the man. Behind her and to the man's left, a crowd of people is gathered, with several individuals holding cameras. To the right, an American flag and a dark blue flag stand next to a wall adorned with several framed portraits.\"",
