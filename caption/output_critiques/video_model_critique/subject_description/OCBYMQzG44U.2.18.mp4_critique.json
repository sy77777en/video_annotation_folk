    "pre_caption": "This video presents a liminal space scenery shot, capturing an eerie and sterile environment. The focus is on the unsettling atmosphere of the location rather than a specific subject, creating a sense of mystery and unease. The scene is a large, rectangular room with walls covered in small, white grid tiles, illuminated by a row of bright, square ceiling lights. This clean, institutional setting is starkly contrasted by the dark, murky water that floods the lower half of the room, with the camera positioned at water level to give an immersive, low-angle perspective. On the left, a large, dark, circular pipe emerges from the wall just above the rippling surface, while in the background, a set of white steps leads up to a raised platform and a tall, featureless doorway, adding to the enigmatic quality of the space.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption violates the instruction to avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions by using words like \"eerie,\" \"unsettling,\" \"mysterious,\" and \"enigmatic.\" It is also overly interpretive, with phrases such as \"creating a sense of mystery and unease\" and \"adding to the enigmatic quality of the space.\" The instruction for scenery shots requires a brief, one-to-three-sentence explanation for the lack of a main subject, but the current caption's explanation is too long. Furthermore, the description of the setting as \"institutional\" is an interpretation, and the phrase \"with the camera positioned at water level to give an immersive, level-angle perspective\" describes the cinematography rather than the scene's contents and should be removed. The caption should be revised to be a purely objective and concise account of the visible elements: the tiled room, the ceiling lights, the dark water, the submerged arched opening, and the steps leading to a doorway.",
