    "pre_caption": "This video features an architectural scenery shot of a long, empty hallway, creating a sterile and unsettling atmosphere. The entire scene is bathed in a cold, monochromatic blue-green light, with the primary illumination coming from a large, brightly lit, multi-paned window at the far end of the corridor. This light reflects faintly on the polished tile floor, emphasizing the length and emptiness of the space. The symmetrical composition, with recessed doorways or alcoves on either side, contributes to the institutional and slightly ominous feel. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the environment and the powerful, clinical mood it evokes, using the vacant space to suggest isolation.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption violates the instruction to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions\" by using words like \"unsettling,\" \"ominous,\" and \"powerful.\" Additionally, phrases that interpret the scene's mood, such as \"contributes to the institutional and slightly ominous feel\" and \"mood it evokes, using the vacant space to suggest isolation,\" are subjective and should be removed. The description should be revised to eliminate this interpretive language and focus solely on objective visual attributes. For instance, instead of describing the \"unsettling atmosphere,\" simply describe the visual elements that create it, like the stark lighting and emptiness. The final sentence explaining the lack of a subject should also be made more concise and objective.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video presents an architectural scenery shot of a long, empty hallway. The scene is illuminated by a monochromatic blue-green light, primarily sourced from a large, brightly lit, multi-paned window at the far end of the corridor. Faint reflections of this light are visible on the polished tile floor. The composition is symmetrical, with recessed doorways or alcoves lining both sides. The focus of the shot is the architectural environment itself, characterized by its stark lighting and vacant space.",
