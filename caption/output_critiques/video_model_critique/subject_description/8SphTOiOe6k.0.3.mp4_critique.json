    "pre_caption": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot capturing a quiet street in a small town. The scene features traditional wooden buildings with tiled roofs lining the street, creating a harmonious blend of architecture. A few people walk along the sidewalk, adding a sense of life and movement, while cars occasionally pass by, contributing to the urban atmosphere. The sky is clear with a few clouds, and distant mountains provide a scenic backdrop, enhancing the sense of scale and environment. The focus is on the overall ambiance and charm of the town rather than any specific object, highlighting the peaceful coexistence of nature and urban life.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption generally captures the cityscape and the ambiance, but it misses key requirements from the instruction. The video features several clearly visible human subjects, including a group of people walking along the sidewalk, some in school uniforms, a man and woman with a child, and others in business attire or casual clothing, many wearing face masks. The caption should specify these subject types and their visual attributes, such as clothing style, color, and groupings, rather than referring to them vaguely as \"a few people.\" The mention of \"cars occasionally pass by\" is accurate, but the caption should describe the cars' colors and types for clarity. The background and atmosphere are described well, but the caption is slightly too long and includes subjective phrases like \"harmonious blend\" and \"charm,\" which should be removed. The focus should shift from general ambiance to a concise, clear description of the visible subjects and their key visual traits, as required by the instruction.",
