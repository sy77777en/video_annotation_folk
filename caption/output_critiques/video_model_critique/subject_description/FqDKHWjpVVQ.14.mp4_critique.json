    "pre_caption": "The video displays a first-person perspective of a black assault rifle, equipped with a red dot sight, held by an unseen player. In the environment, a large, dark green or grey, boxy military vehicle, resembling a tank or armored personnel carrier, is present. Figures in dark, indistinct clothing, representing enemy soldiers, are visible at various distances, sometimes partially obscured by structures. Overlaying the view are game interface elements: a blue minimap with white and blue icons in the lower left corner, blue and white numerical displays for health and ammunition in the lower right corner, and orange and blue diamond-shaped objective markers indicating locations or targets.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is good, but it could be improved by adhering more closely to one specific instruction. Here is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the first-person perspective, the type of weapon as a black assault rifle, the presence of a red dot sight, the large military vehicle, the figures as soldiers, and the specific elements of the game's user interface (HUD), including their colors and locations on the screen.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe description is comprehensive, covering all the salient subjects: the player's weapon, the environmental subjects (vehicle, soldiers), and the interface overlay. It successfully synthesizes information from across the short clip, for instance, by noting the red dot sight which is only clearly visible after the cut.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is concise, clear, and written in simple, natural English as a single paragraph.\n*   **Subject Identification and Attributes:** It uses precise terms (\"assault rifle,\" \"military vehicle\") and describes their key visual attributes well (\"black,\" \"boxy,\" \"dark green or grey\").\n*   **Avoiding Forbidden Terms and Speculation:** It correctly avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame\" and uses cautious language like \"resembling a tank or armored personnel carrier\" where appropriate.\n*   **Shot Transitions:** This is the main area where the caption fails to follow the instructions. The instruction states: \"When shot transitions occur, describe the subject in each segment separately, noting the type of transition... and explaining how the subjects change from one segment to the next.\" The video contains a clear hard cut from a general first-person view to a view aiming down the rifle's sight. The caption combines these two states into a single description without mentioning the transition itself, which is a direct violation of this specific rule.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is very good in terms of its accuracy, clarity, and adherence to most of the rules. However, it is not a perfect caption because it completely omits the description of the hard cut and the change in perspective from a hip-fire view to aiming down the sights, a detail the instructions explicitly require to be described.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with a first-person perspective from a video game, showing a black assault rifle held at the hip. An enemy soldier is visible on a set of outdoor stairs to the left, and a large, dark green, boxy military vehicle, resembling a tank, is in the background. A hard cut then transitions the view to aiming down the rifle's red dot sight. This new perspective is more magnified, looking through the gaps in a wooden structure, with the red dot centered. Throughout both segments, game interface elements are overlaid on the screen, including a blue minimap in the lower-left corner, health and ammunition displays in the lower-right, and various objective markers.",
