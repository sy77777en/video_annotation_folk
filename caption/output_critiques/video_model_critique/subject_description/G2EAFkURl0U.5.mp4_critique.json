The slight pan across the scene further emphasizes the breadth of the setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the video as a scenery shot but lacks the specific visual details required by the instructions. The description of the objects is too general. For instance, it mentions \"log cabins\" but omits their dark brown wood construction and green shingled roofs. It also fails to describe the fire pit as a black, circular basin on a stand, or the picnic table as being made of wood. Additionally, the sentence, \"The slight pan across the scene further emphasizes the breadth of the setting,\" is an interpretation of the camera work's purpose rather than a direct description of the scene's contents and should be removed for conciseness. The explanation for why there is no main subject is also overly long; this justification could be integrated more smoothly by simply describing the environment in detail, which inherently demonstrates the focus.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is an outdoor scenery shot of a tranquil, wooded campground. The focus is on the overall environment, showcasing several rustic cabins made of dark brown logs with green shingled roofs. In the foreground, a designated campsite area on a gravel patch is equipped with a wooden picnic table and a black, circular fire pit on a stand. The ground is scattered with fallen leaves, and the entire area is surrounded by dense trees, creating a peaceful, natural setting.",
