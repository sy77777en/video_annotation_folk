    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work. The caption is well-written and adheres perfectly to all the instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the scene as an outdoor, wooded campground and accurately lists the visible elements: multiple log cabins, picnic tables, and fire pits.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is complete for a scenery shot. It captures the essence of the environment without getting bogged down in unnecessary detail. Mentioning the camera pan and its purpose (\"emphasizes the breadth of the setting\") is a great addition that adds to the completeness of the description.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Scenery Shot Rule:** You correctly identified this as a scenery shot and provided a clear, concise explanation for why there is no main subject, focusing on the overall environment as instructed.\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The paragraph is a single, coherent unit, written in simple, natural English.\n*   **Objectivity:** The description avoids subjective or emotional language.\n*   **Formatting:** The caption is a single paragraph without any introductory text or markdown, as required.\n*   **Motion:** The mention of the camera's pan is justified as it helps to describe the nature of the shot and its focus on the setting's scale.\n\nThe caption is a perfect example of how to handle a scenery shot according to the provided guidelines. No improvements are needed.",
