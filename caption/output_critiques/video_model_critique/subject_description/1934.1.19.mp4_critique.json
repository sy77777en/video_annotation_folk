    "pre_caption": "The video features a person dressed in a full-body white suit, including a helmet and gloves, standing on a dark platform.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on this caption. It is accurate, well-structured, and follows most of the instructions closely. Here is a detailed breakdown of your feedback:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe description is highly accurate. The subject is correctly identified as a person (likely male with a light skin tone) wearing a full-body white suit, including a head covering and gloves, and standing on a dark platform against a dark background.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is good but misses one key visual detail. While it correctly describes the suit as white, it omits the thin, vertical orange or gold stripes running down the outside of the arms and legs. Including this detail would make the description more comprehensive.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is concise, clear, and written in simple, natural English.\n*   **Focus on Subjects:** It correctly focuses on the single, salient subject and their visual attributes (clothing, pose, physical appearance).\n*   **Objectivity:** The description successfully avoids subjective or emotional language.\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single paragraph without any introductory text or markdown, as requested.\n*   **Background:** Mentioning the dark platform and background is appropriate as it provides essential context for the subject's appearance and isolation in the scene.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is very strong. Its only minor shortcoming is the omission of the colored stripes on the suit. Adding this single detail would elevate it from good to excellent.\n\nHere is a revised version incorporating the feedback:\n\n**Revised Caption Example:**\nThe video features a person dressed in a full-body white suit with thin orange stripes down the arms and legs. The suit includes a matching hood and gloves, and the individual stands on a dark platform. The person appears to be male, with a light skin tone visible on his face. He stands upright, facing forward against a completely dark background.",
