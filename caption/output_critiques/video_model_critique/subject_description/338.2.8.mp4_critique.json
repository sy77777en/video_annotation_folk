    "pre_caption": "The video features two women seated at a table in a dining setting. The first woman, with medium-length dark hair and glasses, wears a yellow patterned top and is holding chopsticks over a plate of food. She appears to be focused on her meal. The second woman, with long dark hair and glasses, is dressed in a maroon vest with gold trim over a white shirt, and her name tag reads \"Susan.\" She is also holding chopsticks and is positioned in front of a plate with green vegetables. A glass of iced tea is visible on the table. The transition between the women occurs smoothly, suggesting a shift in focus from one to the other.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **switching from one to another**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the transition occurs, whether through subject movement or camera movement.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your instructions, here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption.\n\n### Feedback\n\nThe caption is well-written and follows many of the instructions, but it has a significant error in accuracy and completeness.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **Incorrect Subject Count:** The most significant error is that the caption states the video features \"two women.\" The video clearly shows three people: a woman in a yellow top, a man in a reddish-brown shirt next to her, and a second woman in a vest. The man is a prominent subject in the initial shot, and his omission makes the description inaccurate.\n*   **Accurate Individual Descriptions:** The descriptions of the two women that are mentioned are accurate. The details about their clothing (yellow patterned top, maroon vest with gold trim), hair, glasses, and actions (holding chopsticks) are correct. The detail about the name tag reading \"Susan\" is also correct.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   **Missing Subject:** The caption is incomplete because it fails to describe the man seated at the table. According to the instructions, all salient subjects should be described. The man is clearly visible and is one of the main subjects of the initial shot.\n*   **Good Secondary Details:** The caption does a good job of including secondary details like the plate of food, the green vegetables, and the glass of iced tea, which adds to the richness of the description.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Partially Adherent:** The caption fails the core instruction to accurately describe the subjects in the video by omitting one of them.\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   It successfully combines details from the different moments into a single, coherent paragraph.\n    *   It avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   It uses simple, natural English.\n    *   It correctly describes the transition as a smooth shift in focus.\n    *   The descriptions of the women are detailed, as requested.\n*   **Minor Issue:** The phrase \"appears to be focused on her meal\" is slightly subjective. A more objective alternative would be \"is looking down at her plate.\" However, this is a minor point compared to the omission of an entire subject.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe caption is well-structured and detailed in its description of the two women. However, its failure to mention the man present in the video is a major flaw that makes it both inaccurate and incomplete, thus not fully adhering to the provided instructions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens on a man and a woman seated at a restaurant table. The woman has medium-length dark hair, glasses, and wears a yellow patterned top. The man beside her wears glasses and a reddish-brown polo shirt. Both are holding chopsticks and eating from plates of food. The focus then smoothly shifts to a second woman at the table. She has long dark hair, glasses, and is dressed in a maroon vest with gold trim over a white shirt; her name tag reads \"Susan.\" She is also holding chopsticks, with a plate containing green vegetables in front of her. A glass of iced tea is visible on the table.",
