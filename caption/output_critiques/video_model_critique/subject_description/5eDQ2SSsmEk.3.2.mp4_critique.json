    "pre_caption": "The video features a close-up of a hand interacting with a control panel. The hand, with a light skin tone, is adjusting dials on a device that resembles a vintage radio or communication equipment. The hand is wearing a dark, ribbed sleeve, suggesting a sweater or jacket. The device has illuminated buttons and displays, with orange and red lights indicating active settings. In another part of the video, a screen is visible, displaying technical data and graphics, possibly related to navigation or communication. The overall scene is dimly lit, with a focus on the interaction between the hand and the equipment, highlighting the technological and manual aspects of the setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on this caption. It is well-written, accurate, and closely follows the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate.\n*   It correctly identifies the main subject as a \"hand interacting with a control panel.\"\n*   The description of the hand (\"light skin tone\"), its clothing (\"dark, ribbed sleeve\"), and its action (\"adjusting dials\") is precise.\n*   The description of the device as resembling \"vintage radio or communication equipment\" with \"illuminated buttons and displays\" and \"orange and red lights\" is spot-on.\n*   The mention of the screen with \"technical data and graphics\" in the second part of the video is also accurate.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very thorough and captures the essential visual information.\n*   It successfully describes both distinct visual segments of the video: the hand on the dial and the brief shot of the screen.\n*   It includes key details like the texture of the sleeve and the colors of the lights, which add to the richness of the description.\n*   A minor detail that could be added for even greater completeness is the specific number \"19\" visible on the digital display, as it is a clear and distinct feature.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption adheres exceptionally well to the given rules.\n*   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph with no introductory text or markdown.\n*   **Language:** It uses simple, natural, and objective English, successfully avoiding subjective or emotional adjectives. The use of \"possibly\" when describing the purpose of the graphics is a good example of correctly handling ambiguity without speculating.\n*   **Subject Focus:** It correctly focuses on the salient subjects (the hand and the equipment) and describes their key attributes in detail.\n*   **Transitions:** The caption acknowledges the change in visuals by stating, \"In another part of the video.\" While this is good, the instruction asks to \"note the type of transition.\" To be more precise, you could describe it as a \"quick pan\" or \"fast transition\" to better capture the motion between the two views.\n*   **Conciseness:** The description is concise while remaining informative, striking a good balance between detail and brevity.\n\n### Overall Assessment\nThis is an exemplary caption. It demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions and a keen eye for detail. The feedback provided is minor and intended only for refinement, as the current caption is already of very high quality.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features a close-up of a hand interacting with a control panel. The hand, with a light skin tone and wearing a dark, ribbed sleeve, adjusts a dial on a device that resembles vintage radio or communication equipment; a small, illuminated digital display shows the number '19'. The device has other illuminated buttons and displays, with orange and red lights indicating active settings. The camera then quickly pans to another screen displaying technical data and graphics, possibly related to navigation or communication. The overall scene is dimly lit, with a focus on the interaction between the hand and the equipment, highlighting the technological and manual aspects of the setting.",
