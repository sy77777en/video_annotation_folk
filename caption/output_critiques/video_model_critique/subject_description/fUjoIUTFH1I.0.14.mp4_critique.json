    "pre_caption": "This video presents a cityscape scenery shot of a quiet, foggy street in what appears to be a historic urban neighborhood. The wet, cracked asphalt reflects the overcast sky, and a thick fog obscures the buildings in the distance, creating a moody and atmospheric quality. On the right, a black convertible and the front of a red car are parked along the curb, while on the left, a person walks along the sidewalk of a stucco building with dark shutters. A group of three people crosses the street in the middle distance, dwarfed by the surrounding architecture and the pervasive mist. The video lacks a main subject, as the focus is placed on the overall environment and the quiet, hazy atmosphere of the scene rather than on any specific individual or object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly classifies the video as a scenery shot lacking a main subject, when in fact there are several salient subjects (people, cars) that should be described in detail according to the instructions. The description of the people is too general and omits required visual attributes like clothing color and style. For instance, it should specify that the group crossing the street consists of three men, one wearing a light-colored hoodie and dark pants, another in a dark t-shirt and light shorts, and the third in a dark t-shirt and dark pants. The caption also completely omits several prominent subjects, including the two red octagonal STOP signs, the black fire hydrant on the left, and the central lamppost. Furthermore, the caption uses the subjective adjective \"moody,\" which is forbidden, and begins with the introductory phrase \"This video presents,\" which should be removed. The final sentence explaining why the video lacks a main subject is inaccurate and should be deleted in favor of a description that focuses on the visible subjects.",

The wet, cracked asphalt reflects the overcast sky, and a thick fog obscures the buildings in the distance, creating an atmospheric quality.

A black fire hydrant sits on the curb next to a central lamppost, which has a red octagonal STOP sign attached to it. In the middle distance, a group of three men crosses the street; one wears a light-colored hoodie and dark pants, another is in a dark t-shirt and light shorts, and the third wears a dark t-shirt and dark pants. On the right side of the street, there is another red octagonal STOP sign. A black convertible and the front of a red car are parked along the curb.",
