    "pre_caption": "This is an architectural scenery shot of a surreal, liminal space resembling a flooded indoor pool or corridor. The camera is positioned at water level, looking down a long, narrow hall with walls covered in small, pale green tiles that curve up to a flat ceiling. A series of square, recessed lights illuminates the scene with a sterile, even glow, reflecting off the tiled surfaces and the murky, rippling water that covers the floor. At the far end, a short flight of white stairs leads up to an open doorway, offering a glimpse into a brighter, hazy area beyond. There is no main subject in the video, as the focus is entirely on the unsettling and expansive atmosphere of the environment. The composition emphasizes the strange architecture and the feeling of isolation rather than any specific object or character.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption violates the instruction to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions\" by using the words \"surreal,\" \"liminal,\" \"sterile,\" \"unsettling,\" and \"strange,\" as well as the phrase \"feeling of isolation.\" These terms should be removed and replaced with objective descriptions where necessary. For instance, the light can be described simply as an \"even glow\" without the word \"sterile.\" Additionally, the final sentence, \"The composition emphasizes the strange architecture and the feeling of isolation rather than any specific object or character,\" is redundant. The previous sentence already sufficiently explains that the focus is on the environment, so this last sentence should be deleted to improve conciseness.",
