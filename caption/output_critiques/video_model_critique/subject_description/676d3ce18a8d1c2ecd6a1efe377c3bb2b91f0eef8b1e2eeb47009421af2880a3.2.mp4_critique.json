The focus is on the environment, highlighting the contrast between the vibrant green trees and the golden-brown fields. The church, with its tall spire and stone architecture, blends into the landscape, emphasizing the harmony between human-made structures and nature. The overall atmosphere is serene and expansive, with no single main subject dominating the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly identifies this as a scenery shot without a main subject. The church is clearly the central and most salient subject and should be described in detail as the primary focus. The caption also includes subjective and interpretive language such as \"lush,\" \"vibrant,\" \"blends into the landscape,\" \"harmony,\" \"serene,\" and \"expansive,\" which should be removed in favor of objective descriptions. Furthermore, the caption omits a key feature of the scene: the graveyard with its many headstones surrounding the church. The description should begin with the church, detailing its stone construction, tall spire, and grey roof, and then describe the surrounding graveyard, the green trees, and the adjacent golden-brown field.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is an aerial shot centered on a stone church. The church features a tall, pointed spire and a grey roof. It is situated within a graveyard with many headstones scattered across the grounds. The area is bordered by green trees on one side and a large, golden-brown harvested field on the other.",
