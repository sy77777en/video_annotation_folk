    "pre_caption": "The video shows a close-up of a wooden cutting board with a person slicing a cucumber into thin, half-moon pieces using a large knife. The person's hands are visible, focusing on the cutting action. In the foreground, there are fresh vegetables, including a red tomato, a bunch of green lettuce, and a purple-tipped onion, arranged neatly. The scene emphasizes the preparation of fresh ingredients, with the cucumber slices accumulating on the board as the cutting progresses.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.",

  "generated_critique": "**Feedback on the Caption:**\n\nThe provided caption is excellent and adheres very well to the instructions.\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the central action of a person slicing a cucumber, the shape of the slices (\"thin, half-moon pieces\"), the tool (\"large knife\"), and the surface (\"wooden cutting board\"). It also accurately lists the other vegetables in the foreground: a red tomato, green lettuce, and a purple-tipped onion.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is comprehensive. It captures not only the primary subjects and action but also the overall context of preparing fresh ingredients. Mentioning that the cucumber slices are accumulating effectively describes the progression of the action within the video.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is a well-written, coherent paragraph that is both concise and informative.\n    *   **Subject Identification and Attributes:** It correctly identifies all subjects (\"person,\" \"cucumber,\" \"knife,\" \"cutting board,\" \"tomato,\" \"lettuce,\" \"onion\") and describes their key visual attributes with precise language (\"wooden,\" \"thin, half-moon,\" \"red,\" \"green,\" \"purple-tipped\").\n    *   **Video-Level Description:** It successfully describes the video as a continuous action (\"slicing,\" \"cutting progresses\") rather than a static image, as instructed.\n    *   **Formatting and Prohibited Terms:** It avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame,\" is presented as a single paragraph, and uses simple, natural English.\n    *   **Objectivity:** The adjectives used are descriptive (\"wooden,\" \"red\") rather than subjective.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is a perfect example of how to follow the given instructions. It is accurate, complete, and well-structured, providing a clear and detailed description of the video's content. No improvements are necessary.",
