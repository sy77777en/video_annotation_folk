    "pre_caption": "The video features several athletes running on a track. The most prominent subject is a man in a blue athletic outfit, sprinting energetically. He is positioned towards the right side of the track. Another athlete, wearing a yellow and black outfit, is visible further back on the track. A third runner, in a red and white outfit, is also present, positioned between the other two athletes. All subjects are focused on the race, displaying determined expressions. The scene captures the intensity and competitive nature of a track event.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Return only the description. Clearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects in focus**, so you need to focus on them. Try to describe them in details and avoid mentioning any scene contents. \n",

  "generated_critique": "The caption generally follows the instruction by identifying the main subjects as athletes and describing their outfits and positions on the track. However, it could be improved by specifying that all four athletes appear to be men, as visible in the video, and by providing more detail on their visual attributes such as skin tone, build, and hairstyle if discernible. The phrase \"displaying determined expressions\" should be removed, as it introduces a subjective emotional interpretation, which the instruction prohibits. The mention of \"the intensity and competitive nature of a track event\" is also subjective and should be omitted. The caption should focus more on the physical description and arrangement of the athletes, such as their running posture and lane positions, and avoid unnecessary commentary on the event's atmosphere.",

The most prominent subject is a man in a blue athletic outfit, sprinting energetically on the right side of the track. He has a medium build and short black hair. Another athlete, wearing a yellow and black outfit, is visible further back on the track, with a lean build and light brown skin. A third runner, in a red and white outfit, is positioned between the other two athletes, with a muscular build and dark brown skin. The fourth athlete, in a green outfit, is on the far left, with a tall build and curly hair. All athletes are focused on the race, with their eyes on the track ahead. The scene captures their running posture and lane positions without additional commentary.",
