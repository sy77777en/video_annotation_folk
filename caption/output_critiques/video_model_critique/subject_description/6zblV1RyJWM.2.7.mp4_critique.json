    "pre_caption": "The video features a silhouetted man standing to the right, facing a white pickup truck equipped with rooftop tents. The man is wearing a hat and appears to be observing the scene. In front of the truck, there is a camping table with various items on it, including a lantern and some containers. The truck is parked on uneven terrain, and the setup suggests a camping scenario. The overall lighting is low, emphasizing the silhouettes and creating a distinct contrast between the subjects and the dimly lit environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "### Feedback on the Caption\n\nThe provided caption is **good** and effectively follows the instructions. Here is a detailed breakdown:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies a \"silhouetted man\" wearing a \"hat,\" a \"white pickup truck,\" \"rooftop tents,\" a \"camping table,\" and a \"lantern.\"\n*   All positional and relational descriptions are correct (man to the right, table in front of the truck).\n*   The inference that the scene is a \"camping scenario\" is accurate and based on clear visual evidence.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is comprehensive, covering all the salient subjects in the video.\n*   It successfully captures the key visual attributes available in the low-light conditions, such as the man's silhouette, the truck's color, and the presence of specific camping gear.\n*   It effectively conveys the overall context of the scene without adding speculative details.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is a single, well-structured paragraph that is both concise and easy to understand.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It uses precise terms like \"man\" and \"pickup truck\" and describes their key attributes (\"silhouetted,\" \"white,\" \"equipped with rooftop tents\").\n*   **Objectivity:** The caption avoids subjective or emotional language. Phrases like \"appears to be observing\" and \"suggests a camping scenario\" are logical deductions based on visual cues, not subjective interpretations.\n*   **Focus:** It correctly focuses on the primary subjects (the man and the truck setup) rather than the non-descript background.\n*   **Formatting:** It adheres to the single-paragraph, no-markdown format.\n*   **Description of Lighting:** The final sentence, which describes the low lighting and silhouettes, is an appropriate inclusion. While the instructions advise against describing the background, the lighting here is a fundamental characteristic of the subjects themselves (i.e., it's why they appear as silhouettes). Describing it is essential for a complete and accurate visual summary.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is excellent. It is accurate, complete, and adheres strictly to all provided guidelines, resulting in a clear and objective description of the video's content.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a dimly lit outdoor scene at dusk or dawn, a silhouetted man in a hat stands observing a white pickup truck. The truck is set up for camping, featuring two deployed rooftop tents. In front of the vehicle, a folding table is arranged with a lit lantern and other gear. The low lighting casts both the man and the camping setup in strong silhouette against the faint light of the sky.",
