    "pre_caption": "The video features a silhouetted man standing to the right, facing a white pickup truck equipped with rooftop tents. The man is wearing a hat and appears to be observing the scene. In front of the truck, there is a camping table with various items on it, including a lantern and some containers. The truck is parked on uneven terrain, and the setup suggests a camping scenario. The overall lighting is low, emphasizing the silhouettes and creating a distinct contrast between the subjects and the dimly lit environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains inaccuracies and superfluous information. The camping table is located in front of the truck, not \"To the right of the truck.\" The description of the man \"walking towards a white pickup truck\" is an interpretation of movement that isn't clearly depicted; a more accurate description would be that he is standing in the foreground. The caption also includes interpretive phrases like \"appears to be observing the scene\" and \"the setup suggests a camping scenario,\" as well as an unnecessary analysis of the lighting (\"The overall lighting is low...\"). These should be removed to focus on observable facts. Additionally, the caption omits several key visual details: the truck's headlights are on, the lantern on the table is lit, there are specifically two rooftop tents, and a shovel is stuck in the ground near the table.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "At dusk, a white pickup truck with its headlights on is parked on sandy terrain. The truck is outfitted with two black, pop-up rooftop tents. Next to the truck, a camping table is set up with a lit lantern on it, and a shovel is stuck in the ground nearby. In the right foreground, the silhouette of a man wearing a hat is visible.",
