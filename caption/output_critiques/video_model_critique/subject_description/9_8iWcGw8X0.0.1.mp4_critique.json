    "pre_caption": "This video presents a sweeping landscape scenery shot, capturing a vibrant rainbow arching across a dramatic sky. The sky itself is a study in contrasts, with dark, heavy clouds looming over a lower expanse of light blue sky dotted with softer white clouds. Below, lush green rolling hills are covered in dense trees and vegetation, creating a rich, natural tapestry. There is no single main subject, as the focus is intentionally placed on the grand scale and atmospheric beauty of the natural environment, emphasizing the ephemeral spectacle of the rainbow against the post-storm sky.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

The final sentence is overly long and contains subjective descriptions such as \"grand scale,\" \"atmospheric beauty,\" and \"ephemeral spectacle.\" This sentence should be revised to be more concise and objective, for example, by stating: \"There is no single main subject, as the focus is on the overall natural environment and the rainbow.\" Additionally, the caption omits the foreground, which includes a grassy clearing and trees that frame the view of the hills.",
