    "pre_caption": "This video presents a sweeping landscape scenery shot, capturing a vibrant rainbow arching across a dramatic sky. The sky itself is a study in contrasts, with dark, heavy clouds looming over a lower expanse of light blue sky dotted with softer white clouds. Below, lush green rolling hills are covered in dense trees and vegetation, creating a rich, natural tapestry. There is no single main subject, as the focus is intentionally placed on the grand scale and atmospheric beauty of the natural environment, emphasizing the ephemeral spectacle of the rainbow against the post-storm sky.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The provided caption is a high-quality example that effectively follows all instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n### Caption Feedback\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the scene as a landscape featuring rolling green hills, a dramatic sky with a mix of dark and light clouds, and a prominent rainbow. The description of these elements is precise and true to the visual content of the video.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is comprehensive. It covers the key components of the scene—the sky, the land, and the rainbow—providing sufficient detail for each. It successfully captures the overall atmosphere and visual composition. While a very faint secondary rainbow is briefly visible, its omission is minor and does not detract from the caption's quality, as the primary rainbow is the clear focus.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres exceptionally well to all given rules:\n    *   **Scenery Shot Protocol:** It correctly identifies the video as a \"landscape scenery shot\" and, as instructed for such cases, provides a clear and concise explanation for the absence of a main subject: \"the focus is intentionally placed on the grand scale and atmospheric beauty of the natural environment.\"\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The description is written as a single, fluent paragraph. It is concise while remaining rich in detail.\n    *   **Objective Language:** The caption successfully avoids overly subjective or emotional language. Adjectives like \"vibrant,\" \"dramatic,\" and \"lush\" are used appropriately to describe specific visual qualities (color intensity, contrast, and density of vegetation) rather than to convey personal feelings.\n    *   **Formatting and Prohibited Terms:** It correctly returns only the single-paragraph description, without any introductory text or markdown. It also avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   **Descriptive Detail:** The caption provides strong visual details, such as \"dark, heavy clouds looming over a lower expanse of light blue sky\" and \"lush green rolling hills are covered in dense trees,\" which helps in visualizing the scene.",
