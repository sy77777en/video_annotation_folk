    "pre_caption": "The video is a seascape scenery shot. It captures the rhythmic motion of waves gently crashing onto a sandy shore. The focus is on the natural environment, highlighting the contrast between the deep green-blue of the ocean and the dark, wet sand. The white foam of the waves creates a dynamic line that emphasizes the movement and energy of the sea. The absence of a specific subject allows the viewer to appreciate the vastness and tranquility of the coastal scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately describes the video as a seascape scenery shot and correctly notes the absence of a specific subject, focusing on the natural environment. It provides clear details about the visual attributes of the scene, such as the deep green-blue ocean, dark wet sand, and white foam of the waves. The mention of the rhythmic motion of waves is appropriate, as it is necessary to convey the dynamic aspect of the scene. The explanation that the focus is on the environment and not on a particular object is concise and aligns with the instruction. The caption avoids subjective adjectives and unnecessary information. The caption is accurate and requires no edits, so it should remain exactly the same.",

It emphasizes the natural environment, highlighting the contrast between the deep green-blue ocean and the dark, wet sand.

With no specific subject, the viewer can fully appreciate the vastness and tranquility of the coastal scene.",
