    "pre_caption": "The video features a large aircraft, specifically a cargo plane, positioned prominently within an indoor setting. The plane is metallic with visible rivets and a distinct nose section. It bears the text \"NORSK FREIGHT\" on its side, indicating its purpose. The aircraft is surrounded by a cloud of smoke or mist, suggesting activity or a process occurring around it. In the foreground, there are several white cargo containers with red and black markings, labeled with \"MUST BE\" and \"N\" symbols, indicating their contents or handling instructions. The scene is illuminated by overhead industrial lights, casting a warm glow over the entire area. The setting appears to be a hangar or a similar facility, emphasizing the industrial and logistical nature of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is mostly accurate in describing the static elements. It correctly identifies the subject as a large \"NORSK FREIGHT\" cargo plane in a hangar, surrounded by cargo containers and illuminated by industrial lights.\n*   However, there is a factual error: the caption mentions the containers are labeled with \"MUST BE,\" which is not visible in the video. The visible labels are \"IKAST JET\" and \"NARSARSUAQ.\"\n*   More significantly, the description of the central event is inaccurate. It describes \"a cloud of smoke or mist, suggesting activity or a process,\" which drastically downplays the violent action shown. The video clearly depicts an explosion followed by a large section of the building's structure crashing into the side of the aircraft, causing the smoke and debris.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is severely incomplete. It completely omits the most crucial event in the video: the explosion and the subsequent impact of a large structure onto the plane. This action is the primary focus of the clip. By failing to mention the crash, the caption misses the entire narrative and dynamic nature of the scene, presenting it as a static environment with some smoke rather than a scene of destruction.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Conciseness and Informativeness:** While the caption is concise, it fails to be informative about the key action, which is a core requirement.\n*   **Describing Action:** The instructions state to describe motion \"if it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships.\" In this case, the action of the structure crashing into the plane is the most salient and necessary detail to describe what is happening. The caption fails to adhere to this by omitting the action entirely.\n*   **Describing Subjects Revealing/Switching:** The caption fails to describe the appearance and action of the collapsing structure, which is a key subject that \"reveals\" itself through its destructive motion.\n*   **Avoiding Subjectivity:** The caption adheres well to this rule, using neutral language.\n*   **Formatting:** The caption correctly follows the one-paragraph format without markdown.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is inadequate because it fails to describe the central, defining action of the video. It accurately identifies the static subjects but misrepresents the event by describing a violent crash as simple \"smoke or mist.\" This omission makes the description misleading and incomplete, failing to capture the essence of the video content.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A large, silver \"NORSK FREIGHT\" cargo plane is inside a brightly lit hangar at night when an explosion occurs outside a large window. Immediately following the blast, a massive section of the building's wall and roof structure collapses inward, crashing violently into the side of the aircraft near its nose. The impact creates a large cloud of smoke and debris that engulfs the point of collision. In the foreground, white cargo containers with \"IKAST JET\" and \"NARSARSUAQ\" logos are visible next to a yellow railing and other loading equipment.",
