    "pre_caption": "The video features a close-up view of a red, textured surface resembling paper or fabric, with handwritten numbers prominently displayed. The numbers \"87,000\" and \"90,000\" are visible, written in bold, black ink. The surface appears to be partially covered with a layer of frost or ice crystals, adding a glistening effect. The lighting casts a bluish tint over the scene, enhancing the contrast between the red background and the black writing. The focus is on the numbers and the icy texture, creating a visually striking composition.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "**Feedback on the Caption:**\n\nThe provided caption is excellent and meets all the requirements of the instructions.\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the main subject as a red, textured surface with handwritten numbers. It accurately transcribes the visible numbers (\"87,000\" and \"90,000\") and correctly notes the black ink. The observation of the \"frost or ice crystals\" and the \"bluish tint\" from the lighting is spot-on and captures crucial visual details.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is very complete. It covers all the salient features of the video: the color and texture of the surface, the specific content of the writing, the crystalline overlay, and the nature of the lighting. It successfully synthesizes these elements to create a full picture of the short clip.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is a single, well-written paragraph that is both concise and easy to understand.\n    *   **Objectivity:** It focuses on objective visual attributes (color, texture, writing, light) and avoids subjective emotional language. The use of \"visually striking composition\" is acceptable as it describes the visual impact rather than an emotional state.\n    *   **Handling Ambiguity:** The use of \"resembling paper or fabric\" and \"appears to be\" is a perfect application of the instruction to avoid stating uncertainties as facts.\n    *   **Subject Identification:** The subject is clearly identified as a \"red, textured surface,\" which is as precise as possible given the close-up, abstract nature of the shot.\n    *   **Formatting:** The caption is a single paragraph with no introductory text, as requested.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is accurate, detailed, and objective, providing a comprehensive description of the video's content. No improvements are needed.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a close-up, a red, textured surface resembling paper or fabric is partially covered with glistening frost or ice crystals. Handwritten in bold, black ink, the numbers \"87,000\" and \"90,000\" are visible. The scene is cast in a cool, bluish light, which enhances the contrast between the red surface, the dark ink, and the icy texture.",
