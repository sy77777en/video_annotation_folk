The station is characterized by its expansive glass and steel structures, casting intricate shadows on the platform. A high-speed train, with a streamlined design and blue accents, is prominently visible, emphasizing the station's role as a hub of transportation. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere, highlighting the blend of modern engineering and urban life rather than a specific object or person. The scene captures the dynamic interaction between the train and the station, illustrating the scale and functionality of the space.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly classifies the video as a \"cityscape scenery shot\" and then provides a lengthy, interpretive explanation for this classification. The video has clear, salient subjects—the train and the people—and the instructions state that the description should focus on them. The caption also includes significant analytical and interpretive language, such as \"emphasizing the station's role,\" \"adding a subtle human element,\" and the entire final sentence, which should be removed. The descriptions of the subjects are incomplete. The caption omits the train's primary white color and its grey stripes. Furthermore, the description of the people is too general; it should include specific details about their appearance and actions, such as the woman in a grey tank top and jeans pulling a black suitcase, and the two women walking together on the platform. The description of the station should also include its prominent white color.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is a shot of a modern, open-air train station. On the left, a white high-speed train with blue and grey stripes is stopped at the platform. The station itself is characterized by its white, futuristic architectural design, with a complex, web-like roof structure over the platform. On the right side of the platform, a woman wearing a grey tank top and jeans walks while pulling a black rolling suitcase. Further in the background, two other women are seen walking on the platform near a set of escalators.",
