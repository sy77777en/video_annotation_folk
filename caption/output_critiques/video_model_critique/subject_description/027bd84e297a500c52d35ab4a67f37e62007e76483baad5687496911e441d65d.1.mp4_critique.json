    "pre_caption": "The video features a set of four Matryoshka dolls arranged in a line from smallest to largest, receding into the background. The dolls are wooden, painted primarily in shades of blue and white with orange details, depicting figures with faces and traditional attire. The smallest doll in the foreground is the most in focus. A human hand with a light skin tone briefly enters the frame from the top right, making a flicking motion towards the smallest doll before retracting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is excellent and adheres perfectly to all instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subjects as a set of four Matryoshka dolls and a human hand. The description of the dolls' arrangement (in a line from smallest to largest), their color scheme (blue, white, orange), and the shallow depth of field (smallest doll in focus) is precise. The description of the hand's appearance (light skin tone), entry point (top right), and action (flicking motion) is also spot-on.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is very complete. It captures both the static composition of the dolls and the brief, dynamic action of the hand entering and exiting the frame. It provides a full account of the video's content from beginning to end without missing any key details.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Conciseness and Format:** The caption is a single, coherent paragraph that is both concise and informative.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It uses precise terms (\"Matryoshka dolls,\" \"human hand\") as instructed.\n*   **Visual Attributes:** It effectively describes the key visual attributes of both the dolls (color, design, arrangement) and the hand (skin tone, action).\n*   **Describing Transitions:** It correctly describes the appearance and disappearance of the hand, fulfilling the instruction to detail how subjects enter or leave the scene.\n*   **Objectivity:** The language is objective and avoids subjective or emotional terms.\n*   **Structure:** The description logically starts with the primary, static subjects (the dolls) before moving to the secondary subject that performs an action (the hand), which is an effective way to structure the information.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the instructions. It is accurate, thorough, and well-written. There are no necessary improvements.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A set of four Matryoshka dolls are arranged in a line from smallest to largest against a plain white background, with the focus on the smallest doll in the foreground. The dolls are wooden and painted with figures in traditional attire, using a color palette of blue, white, and orange. A light-skinned human hand enters the frame from the top right, makes a quick flicking motion above the smallest doll, and then retracts.",
