    "pre_caption": "The video features a passenger boat navigating a river. Initially, it is captured in an extreme wide shot from above and behind, highlighting the boat's position on the river. As the camera arcs around and descends, the focus shifts to a wide shot from the front, revealing the boat's bow. Seated at the bow is a person, whose details are not clearly discernible due to the distance and angle. The river is flanked by lush greenery and a sandy bank, providing a natural backdrop to the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Clearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nKeep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Only mention the background or motion if necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. Avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. Use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. Avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Return only the description.\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows a passenger boat on a river. It begins with an extreme wide shot from above and behind the boat. The camera then arcs around it while descending in altitude. The video ends with a wide shot from the front, showing the boat’s bow and a person seated there.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on your instructions, here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the main subject as a passenger boat on a river. The description of the camera's movement—starting from a high, rear angle and arcing around to a lower, frontal view—is precise and perfectly matches the visual flow of the video. The identification of a person seated at the bow is also correct.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is good but could be more complete.\n*   It successfully describes the primary action and the change in perspective.\n*   However, it omits some key visual details. It fails to mention the other passengers sitting under the boat's canopy, who are visible as the camera moves.\n*   The description of the boat itself could be more detailed. Mentioning its long, narrow shape, dark color, and the blue canopy over the passenger section would add valuable information.\n*   While it correctly notes that the person at the bow is not clearly discernible, it could mention they are wearing a light-colored shirt.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption adheres well to most of the instructions, but there are minor areas for improvement.\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   It is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English.\n    *   It correctly avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   It successfully describes the subject's change in appearance due to the camera's movement, as instructed for transitions.\n    *   It avoids subjective language and speculation, correctly stating that details of the person are not clear.\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   The instruction to \"describe its key visual attributes in detail\" is only partially met. As mentioned under \"Completeness,\" more specific details about the boat (color, shape, canopy) and the group of passengers could have been included.\n    *   The description of the background (\"lush greenery and a sandy bank\") is well-written, but the instructions state to avoid mentioning the background \"unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects.\" In this case, it serves as context rather than a necessary descriptor, but it's a minor deviation that doesn't detract significantly.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features a long, narrow, dark-colored passenger boat navigating a muddy river. Initially, it is captured in an extreme wide shot from above and behind. As the camera arcs around and descends, the perspective shifts to a wide shot from the front. This new angle reveals a blue canopy covering a group of passengers seated in the middle of the boat. At the very front of the bow, a person wearing a light-colored shirt is seated. The river is flanked by sandy banks and distant, tree-covered hills.",
