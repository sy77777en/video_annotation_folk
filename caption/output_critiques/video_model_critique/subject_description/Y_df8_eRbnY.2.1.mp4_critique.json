The scene extends into the distance, revealing a vast expanse of forested terrain and low hills under a clear sky, emphasizing the natural environment and the scale of the landscape. There is no main subject because the focus is on the expansive setting and tranquil atmosphere, rather than any specific object or individual.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption omits a small boat with occupants, which is visible on the river in the upper left portion of the scene. The description also contains the subjective phrase \"tranquil atmosphere,\" which should be avoided. Furthermore, the second half of the caption is redundant and contains commentary rather than description, such as \"adding a subtle dynamic element, but it is not the primary focus\" and the repetitive final sentence. The description should be revised to include the boat and remove the subjective and explanatory language, concisely stating that the focus is on the expansive landscape.",
