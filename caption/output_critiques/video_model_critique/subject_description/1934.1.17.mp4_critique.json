    "pre_caption": "The video features a young person and an older man, both wearing white hooded suits with orange stripes. They have goggles resting on their foreheads. The young person, with short blonde hair visible under the hood, has a fair skin tone and a focused expression. The older man, with a mustache and a fair skin tone, appears concerned. Both subjects are facing forward, suggesting they are looking at something directly ahead.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.",

  "generated_critique": "Feedback:\nThe caption is excellent and adheres very well to the provided instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:** The description is highly accurate. It correctly identifies a \"young person\" and an \"older man,\" and accurately details their matching white hooded suits with orange stripes, the goggles on their foreheads, the boy's blonde hair, and the man's mustache.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is very complete. It covers the essential visual attributes of both subjects, including their clothing, accessories, hair, facial hair, skin tone, and facial expressions. It also correctly notes their forward-facing pose.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The description is a single, well-structured paragraph written in clear, natural English. It is concise while still being informative.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It correctly identifies the subjects as a \"young person\" and an \"older man\" and distinguishes between them effectively.\n*   **Attribute Description:** It provides specific details about their appearance (clothing, hair, etc.) as requested.\n*   **Objectivity:** The caption does a good job of remaining objective. While it uses the words \"focused\" and \"concerned\" to describe expressions, which can be seen as subjective, these are reasonable and common interpretations of the visual cues. The instruction to describe facial expressions while avoiding emotional adjectives is inherently challenging, and the caption navigates this well by using mild, descriptive terms rather than overly dramatic or speculative language.\n*   **Formatting:** It correctly returns only the single-paragraph description without any extra formatting or introductory text.\n\nOverall, this is a high-quality caption that successfully meets all the core requirements of the instructions. It provides a clear, accurate, and detailed summary of the video's subjects.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a stark, all-white room, a young person and an older man are shown from the chest up. They both wear white hooded jumpsuits with orange stripes on the shoulders and white goggles resting on their foreheads. The young person, with visible short blonde hair, looks forward with wide eyes and a slightly parted mouth. Behind them, the older man, who has a prominent mustache, has a similar forward gaze with wide eyes and raised eyebrows.",
