    "pre_caption": "The video features a close-up of a hand holding a screwdriver, which is initially blurred, and a platform that is partially clear. The hand, with a light skin tone, becomes visible as it grips the screwdriver, a tool with a metallic shaft and a dark handle. The hand places a small, metallic nail on the platform, which has a rough, textured surface. The nail is positioned in the lower-left corner of the frame. After placing the nail, the hand moves out of the frame, leaving the nail standing upright on the platform. The focus shifts from the blurred screwdriver to the clear view of the nail, emphasizing the action of placing it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows a hand holding a screwdriver and placing a nail on a platform. Initially, only the screwdriver is blurred in the frame, with part of the platform clear. The hand then becomes visible in a close-up, holding the screwdriver. After placing the nail in the lower-left corner of the frame, the hand moves out of the frame.**\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **Incorrect Subject Identification:** The caption incorrectly identifies the fastener as a \"nail.\" The object has a helical ridge (threads) and a slotted head, which are characteristic features of a screw, not a nail.\n*   **Incorrect Attribute Description:** The caption describes the screwdriver's handle as \"dark.\" In the video, the handle is clearly made of a translucent, amber-colored plastic.\n*   **Inaccurate Action Description:** The caption states the hand \"places\" the screw. The video doesn't show the full action of placement. Instead, a hand holding a screwdriver moves away, revealing a screw that is already standing upright. A more accurate description would be that the hand moves away to reveal the screw.\n*   **Minor Inaccuracy:** The caption says the hand \"becomes visible,\" but it is visible, albeit blurry, from the beginning. The focus simply sharpens on other elements as the hand moves.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is mostly complete. It successfully identifies the main subjects (hand, tool, fastener, surface) and the primary action (the movement of the hand and the shift in focus). It captures the essence of the short clip.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violation of \"No 'frame' or 'image'\":** The instruction explicitly states, \"avoid using terms like 'image' or 'frame'.\" The caption violates this rule by using the word \"frame\" twice (\"lower-left corner of the frame,\" \"moves out of the frame\").\n*   **Violation of \"Precise Terms\":** The instruction requires using \"precise terms\" for subject types. Calling a screw a \"nail\" is a direct violation of this rule.\n*   **Violation of \"Specific and Descriptive Language\":** The instruction asks for specific descriptions of visual attributes. Describing the translucent amber handle as \"dark\" is an inaccurate description that fails to meet this requirement.\n*   **Partial Adherence to \"One-paragraph\":** The caption is a single paragraph as requested.\n*   **Adherence to \"No Subjective Adjectives\":** The caption correctly avoids using subjective or emotional language.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe caption attempts to follow the instructions but fails on several key points. The most significant errors are the misidentification of the screw as a nail, the inaccurate description of the screwdriver's handle, and the repeated use of the forbidden word \"frame.\" While the overall structure and intent are good, these inaccuracies and rule violations make it a poor caption according to the provided guidelines.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is a dimly lit, close-up shot of a hand holding a screwdriver with a translucent, amber-colored handle. The hand pulls the screwdriver away and out of view, revealing a small, dark metallic screw standing upright on a rough, dusty surface. As the hand and tool move away, the focus shifts to the screw, bringing it into sharp detail while the background remains blurred.",
