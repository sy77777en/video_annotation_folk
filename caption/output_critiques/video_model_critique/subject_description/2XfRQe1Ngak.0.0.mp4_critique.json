    "pre_caption": "The video features a person, viewed from behind, as the main subject. This individual is wearing a red long-sleeved outer garment, a black and green life vest, and a grey helmet adorned with an orange and white \"Teva\" logo. They are seated in a red kayak and are actively paddling with a double-bladed paddle through turbulent water within a narrow canyon defined by steep, grey, rocky walls on either side. The person is navigating the kayak forward, moving through the confined waterway towards a more agitated section of whitewater ahead.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with one clear main focus**, so you need to clarify who the main subject is. The description should focus on the details of the main subject while concisely summarizing secondary subjects and describing their relationship to the main subject if clear.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly frames the video as featuring two distinct subjects when it is a first-person point-of-view shot from a single kayaker's perspective. The second individual is only briefly visible for the first two seconds and is a minor background element, not a secondary subject. The description should be revised to reflect this perspective, starting with a phrase like \"This first-person point-of-view video follows a kayaker...\" instead of \"The video features two individuals...\" Consequently, the detailed description of the second person is disproportionate to their brief appearance and should be simplified to a brief mention, such as \"who briefly sees another kayaker in red ahead.\" The phrase \"viewed from behind\" is also less accurate than identifying the shot as a first-person perspective.",

The kayaker wears a red outer garment, a black and green life vest, and a grey helmet with an orange and white \"Teva\" logo. Seated in a red kayak, they use a double-bladed paddle to move through turbulent water enclosed by steep, grey rock walls. The kayaker paddles forward through the confined waterway, heading towards a more agitated section of whitewater and a drop, where another kayaker was briefly visible at the start of the clip.",
