    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dramatic landscape scenery shot, capturing the immense power of a developing supercell storm over a flat, open plain. The sky is dominated by a colossal, swirling mass of dark grey and black clouds that churn and expand, with a small patch of blue sky visible to the left. Along the horizon, a warm, golden light illuminates the scene, contrasting sharply with the ominous clouds above, and bright shafts of what appears to be rain or sunlight break through the storm's base. There is no main subject in the traditional sense; the focus is entirely on the vast, atmospheric spectacle, emphasizing the scale and raw beauty of the natural environment over any single object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption uses several subjective adjectives that convey emotion or impression, such as \"dramatic,\" \"immense power,\" \"colossal,\" \"warm,\" \"ominous,\" and \"raw beauty,\" which violates the instruction to avoid such terms. The specific identification of the weather event as a \"supercell storm\" is an interpretation and should be replaced with a more general, observable description like \"a large storm system\" or \"a large storm cloud.\" While the explanation for the lack of a main subject is correctly included, it also contains subjective language (\"vast,\" \"raw beauty\") that should be removed. The description should be rephrased to be more objective, focusing only on the visual attributes of the scene.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video shows a time-lapse of a large storm cloud system developing over a flat, open plain. The sky is largely covered by a mass of dark grey and black clouds that appear to rotate and expand. A small area of blue sky is visible to the left. The horizon is illuminated by a golden light, creating a contrast with the dark underside of the clouds. Bright shafts, which could be rain or beams of light, extend downwards from the base of the storm system. There is no single main subject; the composition focuses on the large-scale atmospheric event over the landscape.",
