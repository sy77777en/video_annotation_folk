    "pre_caption": "The video features a bird standing in shallow water. The bird has a distinctive appearance with a gray body, black and white wings, and a bright yellow beak. Its head is light gray, and it appears to be wading or moving slightly in the water. The bird's posture is upright, and it seems to be engaged in a natural behavior typical of its environment. The water around the bird is calm, with slight ripples indicating gentle movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains several inaccuracies and omits key details. The most significant error is the description of the bird's action; it is not \"wading or moving slightly\" in \"calm\" water, but is actively and vigorously bathing, splashing, and shaking its feathers. The description of its appearance is also partially incorrect and incomplete. The caption states it has a \"gray body,\" but the bird has a gray head and neck, white underparts, and a gray-brown back. A prominent feature, the yellow wattle in front of its eye, is completely missing from the description. Additionally, the phrase \"reflecting its natural behavior in the environment\" is interpretive and should be removed. The description should be corrected to state that the bird is vigorously bathing in shallow water. Its appearance should be described more accurately as having a gray head and neck, white underparts, a gray-brown back, black and white wings, a bright yellow beak with a black tip, and a yellow wattle in front of its eye.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video shows a bird vigorously bathing in shallow, muddy water. The bird has a gray head and neck, white underparts, a gray-brown back, and wings with black and white feathers. A prominent yellow wattle is visible in front of its eye, and its bright yellow beak has a black tip. The bird actively dips its head and shakes its body, splashing water as it cleans its feathers.",
