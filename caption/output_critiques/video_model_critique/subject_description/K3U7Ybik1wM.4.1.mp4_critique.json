    "pre_caption": "This video presents a window view scenery shot, capturing a dramatic sunset from the perspective of a dimly lit room. The scene is framed by heavy, dark red curtains, which draw the eye towards the central window. Through the glass, a vibrant sky glows with a gradient of fiery orange and yellow near the horizon, softening into shades of pink and purple higher up, with a few clouds visible against the lighter part of the sky. A large, leafy tree is starkly silhouetted against this colorful backdrop, its dark form creating a strong visual contrast. There is no single main subject, as the composition's focus is on the overall atmosphere and the breathtaking natural beauty of the sunset, framed by the domestic interior.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains several subjective and emotive adjectives, such as \"dramatic,\" \"vibrant,\" \"fiery,\" and \"breathtaking,\" which violate the instruction to avoid language that conveys emotion. The phrase \"which draw the eye towards the central window\" is an interpretation of compositional effect rather than a direct description. The caption also omits two visible details: the light-colored frame of the window and the dark fence visible below the tree. To improve, remove the subjective adjectives and the interpretive phrase. The final sentence should be rephrased to be more objective, for instance, by stating that the focus is on the atmospheric view of the sunset from an interior perspective, and the details of the window frame and fence should be added.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video presents a window view scenery shot, capturing a sunset from the perspective of a dimly lit room. The scene is framed by heavy, dark red curtains on either side of a light-colored window frame. Through the glass, the sky shows a gradient of orange and yellow near the horizon, transitioning to shades of pink and purple higher up, with a few clouds visible against the lighter part of the sky. A large, leafy tree is silhouetted against this backdrop, and a dark fence is visible below it. The dark form of the tree creates a visual contrast with the colored sky. The focus of the shot is the atmospheric view of the sunset from an interior perspective.",
