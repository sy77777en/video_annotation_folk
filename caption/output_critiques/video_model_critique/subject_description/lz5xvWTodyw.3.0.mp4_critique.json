The focus is on the urban environment, showcasing the scale and atmosphere of the city rather than highlighting a specific object or subject. The emphasis is on the overall setting, including buildings, roads, and the surrounding area, creating a sense of place and mood.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly identifies the primary subject as a \"train\" when it is an articulated green bus driving on a road with lane markings. The description also includes subjective and interpretive phrases like \"adding a dynamic and interactive element to the scene, which highlights the scale and atmosphere of the city,\" which should be removed in favor of objective descriptions. A significant omission is the failure to mention any of the prominent video game user interface (UI) elements, which are key subjects. The caption should be revised to accurately describe the green articulated bus and also include descriptions of the on-screen UI, such as the large white directional arrow, the text in the corners indicating \"Pier 59,\" \"segments,\" and \"Passengers,\" and the circular \"JUMP\" meter. The focus should be on these salient subjects rather than the general cityscape.",

The bus is driving on an elevated road in a city during foggy or twilight conditions. Several video game user interface (UI) elements are visible on the screen. In the top right corner, text reads \"Pier 59.\" A large, white, three-dimensional arrow points downward in the upper center of the screen, indicating direction. In the bottom left, a small green route map is displayed next to the number \"193\" and the word \"segments.\" At the bottom center, a passenger counter shows \"067 / 970 Passengers.\" In the bottom right corner, a circular green meter labeled \"JUMP\" is at 100%.",
