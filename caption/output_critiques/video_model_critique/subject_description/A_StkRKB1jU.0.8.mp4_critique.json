    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects with no clear main focus**. Because it does not emphasize any specific subject, please briefly describe the types of subjects without going into too much detail. You may also describe the subjects collectively as a group.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subjects as a group of men dressed in dark suits and running. The description of the white clown masks with painted details like red smiles and blue accents is precise and matches the visual evidence. The observation that some men carry black handguns while others hold large bags is also correct and verifiable from the video.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is very complete, capturing all the most salient details about the subjects. It describes their number (a group), type (men), attire (dark suits), key features (clown masks), actions (running), and the objects they are carrying (handguns, bags). It successfully summarizes the key information without omitting any crucial visual elements related to the subjects.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres perfectly to all the given instructions:\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** It is a single, clear, and concise paragraph.\n*   **Subject Focus:** It focuses entirely on the subjects (the men) and their key visual attributes, as instructed.\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids subjective adjectives and uses descriptive, objective terms (\"dark,\" \"white,\" \"painted,\" \"large\").\n*   **Proper Terminology:** It correctly identifies the subjects as \"men\" and the objects as \"handguns\" and \"bags.\" It avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Handling of Multiple Subjects:** It effectively describes the subjects as a group while distinguishing them by the items they carry (\"Some... while others...\"), which is an excellent way to handle multiple similar subjects.\n*   **Background and Motion:** It correctly includes the essential action (\"running\") but appropriately omits details about the background (the hall), adhering to the rule to only mention them if necessary for context.\n\nIn summary, the caption is excellent. It is accurate, complete, and follows every rule outlined in the instructions, resulting in a high-quality description of the video's content.",
