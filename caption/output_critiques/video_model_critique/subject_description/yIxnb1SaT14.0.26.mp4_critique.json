    "pre_caption": "This is a dramatic cityscape scenery shot, captured from a low angle looking up at grand European architecture against a deep blue night sky. On the left, a curved stone building is warmly illuminated, highlighting its detailed facade, open shutters, and an ornate iron balcony. In the background, a taller, turreted structure stands mostly in silhouette, its dark form creating a sense of imposing scale. There is no single main subject; instead, the composition emphasizes the majestic and atmospheric quality of the urban environment, using the interplay of light, shadow, and architectural forms to evoke a feeling of nocturnal grandeur.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains subjective adjectives such as \"dramatic,\" \"majestic,\" \"atmospheric,\" and \"nocturnal grandeur,\" which should be removed to maintain objectivity as per the instructions. The sentence \"The deep blue sky serves as the background\" is redundant, as the sky is already mentioned in the first sentence. Additionally, identifying the structure as \"a railway on an overpass\" is an assumption; it should be described more neutrally as \"the dark balustrade of an overpass.\" The final sentence, which explains the lack of a main subject, should be rephrased to be more concise and descriptive of the composition rather than the feeling it evokes.",

On the left, a curved stone building is warmly illuminated, highlighting its facade, open shutters, and an ornate iron balcony. In the background, a turreted building stands in silhouette, while the dark balustrade of an overpass is visible in the lower right. The composition is structured around the contrast between the lit building on the left and the silhouetted forms on the right.",
