    "pre_caption": "This is a landscape scenery shot of a tranquil, snow-covered forest at night. A tall, slender pine tree stands as a central focal point, its dark green needles lightly dusted with snow, anchoring the composition against a backdrop of a dense evergreen forest. The ground is covered in a thick, pristine blanket of white snow. Above, the dark, star-filled sky is dramatically illuminated by the vibrant green glow of the aurora borealis, which swirls and dances in wide bands behind wispy clouds. There is no single main subject; instead, the focus is on capturing the breathtaking atmosphere and the majestic scale of the natural world, where the celestial light show and the serene winter landscape combine to create a powerful environmental portrait.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption violates the instruction to avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Words such as \"tranquil,\" \"dramatically,\" \"breathtaking,\" \"majestic,\" \"serene,\" and \"powerful\" should be removed. The final sentence, which explains the lack of a main subject, is overly long and contains most of these subjective terms. It should be rewritten to be more concise and objective. For instance, the phrase \"the focus is on capturing the breathtaking atmosphere and the majestic scale of the natural world, where the celestial light show and the serene winter landscape combine to create a powerful environmental portrait\" should be replaced with a more neutral statement like \"the focus is on the overall environment, combining the celestial display with the winter landscape.\"",
