    "pre_caption": "This video presents a countryside scenery shot, focusing on the atmosphere of a quiet, rural setting rather than a specific subject. The view begins from a wet, flagstone patio, looking out over a vibrant green lawn towards a wooden-fenced pasture where two brown horses graze among yellow wildflowers under a cloudy sky. The camera then gently tilts down, shifting the focus from the pastoral landscape to the detailed, irregular pattern of the damp, weathered stones of the patio itself. The absence of a main subject allows the viewer to absorb the tranquil environment and the textures of the natural and man-made elements within it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption omits several key subjects and a visual effect. It should be updated to include the two potted plants on the patio, one in a blue-green pot and the other in a terracotta pot, as they are prominent foreground elements. Additionally, a black dog is visible in the pasture with the two brown horses and should be mentioned. The caption also fails to describe the soft, semi-transparent overlay of the patio's stone pattern that is visible over the entire scene at the beginning before fading. Finally, the last sentence, \"The absence of a main subject allows the viewer to absorb the tranquil environment and the textures of the natural and man-made elements within it,\" is interpretative and should be removed to maintain a purely descriptive tone as required by the instructions. The adjective \"vibrant\" is subjective and should be replaced or removed.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with a countryside view seen through a semi-transparent overlay of a stone pattern, which then fades. The initial shot is from a wet, flagstone patio, where two potted plants—one in a blue-green pot and the other in a terracotta pot—sit at the edge. The view looks out over a green lawn towards a wooden-fenced pasture where two brown horses and a black dog are visible among yellow wildflowers under a cloudy sky. The camera then gently tilts down, shifting the focus from the pastoral landscape to the detailed, irregular pattern of the damp, weathered stones of the patio itself.",
