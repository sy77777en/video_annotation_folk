    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide cityscape scenery shot, capturing a tranquil harbor at dusk against the backdrop of a modern metropolis. The foreground is a calm body of water dotted with numerous small fishing boats, some clustered in groups while others move slowly across the surface. In the distance, a prominent skyline rises, featuring several tall, sleek skyscrapers that pierce the hazy, pale sky. The shot lacks a single main subject, as the elevated, static perspective is used to convey the overall atmosphere and scale of the urban waterfront, highlighting the juxtaposition of traditional maritime life with contemporary architecture.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains several inaccuracies and violates some instructions. The statement that the camera \"tilts upward\" is incorrect; the camera is either static or pulls back very slowly, but there is no tilting motion. The description of a \"small section of beach\" is also inaccurate, as the lower right corner shows a rocky or concrete embankment, not a sandy beach. Consequently, the claim that this \"beach area disappears\" is false, as the embankment remains visible throughout the video. The caption also uses the forbidden word \"frame.\" Finally, the adjectives \"tranquil\" and \"natural beauty\" are subjective and should be removed. The description should be revised to accurately reflect the static, elevated shot of the harbor, correctly identify the shoreline, and remove the subjective language and forbidden term.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This wide, aerial shot shows a city harbor at dusk. The camera slowly pulls back and up, expanding the view. In the foreground, the water is filled with small fishing boats, some clustered together and others moving. To the left is a pier. In the background, a skyline of modern skyscrapers stands against the hazy evening sky. A rocky embankment is visible along the shoreline in the lower right.",
