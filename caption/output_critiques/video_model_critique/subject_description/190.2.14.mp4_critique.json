    "pre_caption": "The video features a woman and a man. The woman has short, dark curly hair and is wearing a dark outfit with a colorful scarf. Her expression is neutral, and she is facing slightly to the side. The man has short, curly dark hair and is dressed in a dark jacket over a light-colored shirt. He is looking at the woman with a neutral expression. Both subjects are positioned close to each other, suggesting a conversation or interaction.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is mostly accurate but can be improved by removing subjective and inferential language and adding more specific visual detail. The phrase \"suggesting a dynamic conversation or interaction\" is an interpretation rather than a direct visual observation and should be removed. Similarly, stating they \"engage in conversation\" is an inference based on mouth movements. A more objective description would focus solely on their physical actions. Additionally, while the scarf is described as \"colorful,\" you could enhance the description by mentioning the visible colors, such as red and yellow. The description of the woman's action as \"turns her head to look around\" is also a bit vague; it would be more precise to state that she looks up and then turns toward the man.",

The woman then turns her head to face the man, her mouth moving, and the man turns to look at her.",
