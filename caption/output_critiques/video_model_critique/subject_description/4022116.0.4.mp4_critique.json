    "pre_caption": "This is a cityscape scenery shot where the focus is on the architectural grandeur and atmosphere of a Venetian setting rather than a specific object or individual. The video showcases a magnificent, domed basilica constructed from light-colored stone, heavily adorned with statues and intricate carvings, featuring a wide staircase leading up to a large, dark green central door. To its right, a simpler building with a red-tiled roof is visible. In the foreground, dark gondolas are moored in the calm water at the foot of the stairs, while small figures of people on the steps and in the vicinity highlight the monumental scale of the main structure under an overcast sky. The camera's slight movement reinforces the environmental focus, capturing the overall splendor and context of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on this caption. It is a high-quality description that adheres very well to the provided instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the scene as a Venetian cityscape featuring a large, domed basilica (the Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute).\n*   All visual details are correct: the light-colored stone, statues, carvings, wide staircase, dark green door, the adjacent red-tiled building, the dark gondolas in the water, the small figures of people, and the overcast sky.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The description is very complete. It captures the primary architectural subject, the surrounding environment, and the atmospheric conditions.\n*   It effectively notes the presence of people and gondolas, correctly contextualizing them as elements that add to the scene's scale and setting rather than as primary subjects.\n*   Mentioning the camera's movement and its purpose (reinforcing the environmental focus) is an excellent detail that adds to the completeness of the description.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Scenery Shot Rule:** You have perfectly applied the instruction for scenery shots. The caption starts by correctly identifying the video as a cityscape where the focus is on the environment and architecture, and it explains this rationale clearly.\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The paragraph is well-written, coherent, and flows naturally. It provides a rich description without being overly wordy.\n*   **Subject Description:** The description of the basilica and its features is detailed and uses specific, descriptive language as requested.\n*   **No Subjective Language:** The caption does an excellent job of remaining objective. Words like \"magnificent\" and \"splendor\" are used appropriately to describe the visual quality of \"grandeur\" mentioned in the first sentence, which is an observable characteristic of the architecture's design and scale.\n*   **Formatting:** The output is a single, clean paragraph without any introductory text or markdown, exactly as instructed.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThis is an exemplary caption. It demonstrates a thorough understanding of all instructions, particularly the nuanced rule for describing scenery shots. The description is accurate, detailed, and well-structured, providing a clear and comprehensive overview of the video's content.",
