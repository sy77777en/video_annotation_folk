    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up of a round, textured metal manhole cover on a paved surface, featuring a grid pattern and several bolt holes. As the scene transitions, the focus shifts to the underside of the manhole cover, revealing a device attached to it.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **switching from one to another**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the transition occurs, whether through subject movement or camera movement.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on this caption. It is a well-written, accurate, and detailed description that perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n### Feedback\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is perfectly accurate. It correctly identifies the manhole cover and the device beneath it. The descriptions of their visual attributes—the \"round, textured metal\" cover with a \"grid pattern\" and the device with \"red cylindrical objects resembling dynamite sticks,\" \"colorful wires,\" and a \"digital timer\"—are precise and true to the video.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is comprehensive. It covers the initial subject, the transition, and the revealed subject, leaving out no essential visual information. It effectively captures the two-part narrative of the video (the ordinary surface and the hidden danger).\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is written in clear, simple English and gets straight to the point without unnecessary words.\n    *   **Subject Identification:** You have used precise terms like \"manhole cover\" and \"device,\" and then further described the device's components, which is excellent. The use of \"resembling dynamite sticks\" is a great example of describing something based on visual similarity without making an unverified claim.\n    *   **Visual Attributes:** The description of textures, shapes, colors, and components is specific and detailed, fulfilling the instruction to describe key visual attributes.\n    *   **Handling Transitions:** The way you describe the transition is exemplary. Phrases like \"As the scene transitions, the focus shifts...\" and \"revealing a device\" clearly explain the change between the two parts of the video.\n    *   **Objectivity:** The language is objective and avoids emotional or subjective terms. The final sentence, \"The transition highlights the concealed nature of the device,\" is a factual summary of the visual narrative's effect rather than a subjective opinion, and it serves as a strong concluding statement that ties the description together.\n    *   **Formatting:** The caption is a single, coherent paragraph as requested.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis caption is an outstanding example of how to follow the instructions. It is accurate, detailed, and well-structured. No improvements are needed.",
