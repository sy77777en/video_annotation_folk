    "pre_caption": "A pixelated character, appearing as a humanoid figure with a single, large, glowing orange eye for a head, is clad in a tattered red cloak and dark trousers. This character wields a long, glowing yellow sword and possesses red, wing-like appendages on its back that emit a bright blue, vertical beam of light. To the left, on a separate platform, sits a blue, glowing potion in a clear, round-bottomed flask. At the bottom left of the screen, several square icons are displayed: one depicts a blue, jagged, lightning-like symbol; another shows a blue, swirling, windy pattern; a third features a stylized, brown and white owl's head; and a fourth displays a purple crossbow.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

Secondly, the object that appears on the right is not \"a table with a set of chemistry lab equipment\" but a single purple potion on a pedestal. Thirdly, the UI icon described as a \"blue wind-shaped tail\" is incorrect; it is a health flask icon with a plus sign on it. Lastly, the caption fails to mention the primary weapon icon displayed in the bottom-left corner, which is a blue, glowing sword to the left of the bomb symbol.",

The background features a large, full moon against a teal and green nebula-filled night sky. To the left, on a separate platform, sits a blue, glowing potion in a flask. As the character moves right, a purple potion on a pedestal comes into view. At the bottom left of the screen, several square icons are displayed: a blue, glowing sword; a blue icon with two jagged, lightning-like arrows; a green health flask with a plus sign; a stylized, brown and white owl's head; and a purple crossbow. A minimap is visible in the bottom right corner.",
