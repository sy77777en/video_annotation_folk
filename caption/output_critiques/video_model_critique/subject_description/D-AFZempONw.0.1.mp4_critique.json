    "pre_caption": "A muscular man with pale, mottled skin is shown wearing a metallic mask that covers most of his face, with a white section around his open mouth. A large apparatus is attached to his upper back and the back of his head, from which numerous thick, ribbed tubes extend. These tubes are initially a pinkish-red color before transitioning to a glowing, neon green. The man also wears a metallic harness over his shoulders and upper back where the tubes connect.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

He is shown wearing a metallic mask that covers most of his face, including a white section around his open mouth and open eyes. Additionally, he is restrained by a shackle around his chest and upper back. A large apparatus is attached to his back, with numerous thick, ribbed tubes extending from it. These tubes initially appear gray before transitioning to a glowing, neon green and then reverting back to gray. There is an additional connection in the middle of these tubes. Four tubes are connected together at the top of his head, and one tube extends from each shoulder. It is also evident that his arms are covered near the elbows with large black devices",

The description of the color change is also precise.\n*   **Completeness:** The description is comprehensive, capturing all the essential visual information. It not only describes the static elements but also effectively details the key transition in the video—the tubes changing from pinkish-red to glowing green—which is crucial to understanding the scene.\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows the instructions flawlessly.\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** It is a single, well-structured paragraph that is both concise and rich in detail.\n    *   **Objective Language:** It uses descriptive, objective adjectives (\"metallic,\" \"ribbed,\" \"glowing\") and avoids subjective or emotional language.\n    *   **Subject Focus:** It focuses entirely on the main subject, correctly ignoring the indistinct background.\n    *   **Describing Change:** It expertly describes the change over time without referring to specific frames or using forbidden terms like \"image.\"\n    *   **Formatting:** It is presented as a single paragraph without any introductory text or markdown, as requested.\n\nThe caption is an exemplary execution of the given task.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A muscular man with pale, mottled skin arches his back, his head tilted back with his mouth open in a silent roar. He wears a metallic mask with a white section around the mouth opening. Attached to his upper back and the back of his head is a large apparatus secured by a metallic harness. Numerous thick, ribbed tubes snake from the device; they are initially a dull pinkish-red but then fill with a glowing, neon-green substance.",
