    "pre_caption": "This is a forest scenery shot depicting a network of wooden platforms and rope bridges suspended high among the tall, slender trunks of evergreen trees. The perspective is from one of these platforms, with a heavily blurred, textured tree trunk in the immediate foreground, creating a sense of depth and drawing the eye towards the distant structures weaving through the dense, green canopy. There is no main subject in the video, as the focus is on capturing the immersive atmosphere and impressive scale of the treetop walkway within its natural forest setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies this as a forest scenery shot and accurately describes the environment, following the specific instructions for this type of video. However, it can be made more concise and objective. The second sentence is overly descriptive and contains the interpretive phrase \"drawing the eye towards,\" which should be removed. The final sentence uses the subjective adjectives \"immersive\" and \"impressive,\" which should be omitted to adhere strictly to the instructions. The description of the foreground element could be integrated more concisely into the first sentence, and the final sentence could be rephrased to state that the focus is on \"the scale of the treetop walkway within its natural forest setting.\"",
