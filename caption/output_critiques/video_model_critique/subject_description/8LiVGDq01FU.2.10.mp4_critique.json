The suit has distinct light-colored stripes and padding, suggesting a design for protection or specialized activity. The person is oriented with their back to the viewer, slightly leaning forward with arms extended, possibly indicating movement or interaction with the surroundings. The setting is characterized by vertical and horizontal lines, contributing to a high-tech, industrial atmosphere. The lighting is dim, with reflections on the surfaces, enhancing the sleek and modern aesthetic.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subject as a person in a spacesuit-like outfit with a helmet. The descriptions of the suit's features (dark color, light-colored stripes, padding), the person's pose (back to the viewer, leaning forward), and the environment (futuristic, metallic, vertical/horizontal lines, dim lighting) are all faithful to the visual information in the video.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is very complete. It successfully captures the main subject, their key visual attributes, their orientation and pose, and the defining characteristics of the complex background. It provides a comprehensive overview of the scene's content and mood.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres to most instructions well, but there are a few areas where it deviates from the strict guidelines.\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n    *   It correctly uses \"person\" as the subject type, as gender is not discernible.\n    *   It describes key visual attributes (clothing, pose, orientation) in detail.\n    *   It correctly identifies the need to describe the background as it is a crucial part of the scene's context.\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   **Subjective/Interpretive Language:** The instructions state to \"avoid subjective adjectives\" and \"avoid describing what you are unsure about.\" The caption includes several interpretive phrases:\n        *   \"...*suggesting* a design for protection or specialized activity.\" (This is an inference about the suit's purpose).\n        *   \"...*possibly indicating* movement or interaction...\" (This is an interpretation of the person's action).\n        *   \"...contributing to a *high-tech, industrial atmosphere*.\" (This describes the feeling of the scene, which is subjective).\n        *   \"...enhancing the *sleek and modern aesthetic*.\" (This uses subjective adjectives).\n\n**Revised Caption Example (for comparison):**\n\nTo better align with the instructions, a more objective version would look like this:\n\n\"The video shows a person from behind, wearing a dark, full-body suit and a helmet. The suit features light-colored padding on the shoulders and back, as well as a light-colored belt. The person is in a forward-leaning stance with their arms partially extended. The surrounding environment is dark and filled with blurred horizontal and vertical lines of light. The scene is dimly lit, with bright reflections visible on the person's suit and the background structures.\"",
