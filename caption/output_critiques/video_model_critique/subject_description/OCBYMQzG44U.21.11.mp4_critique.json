    "pre_caption": "This video presents an interior architectural scenery shot, looking down into a swimming pool area. The pool, filled with rippling teal water, is partially encircled by a white spiral staircase featuring a metallic railing. The surrounding walls and floor are covered in white square tiles. A small, indistinct orange object floats in the water. There is no main subject as the focus is on the clean, minimalist architectural design and the serene atmosphere of the aquatic space, rather than any particular entity.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly begins by describing the camera's movement (\"The video begins by... pans... tilts downward, transitioning...\"), which violates the instruction to describe the scene as a whole rather than narrating the shot's progression. The caption also includes the subjective adjectives \"playful\" and \"serene,\" which are explicitly forbidden by the instructions. The description of the \"rubber duck\" is missing its prominent yellow color. The final sentence, which explains why this is a scenery shot, is appropriate but should be rephrased to remove the subjective word \"serene.\" The entire description should be a single, concise paragraph focusing on the static elements of the revealed scene.",

A white spiral staircase with a metallic railing partially encircles the pool, which is filled with teal water. The surrounding walls and floor are covered in white square tiles. A small yellow rubber duck floats in the water. This is a scenery shot, as the composition emphasizes the clean architectural lines and the overall environment over any single subject.",
