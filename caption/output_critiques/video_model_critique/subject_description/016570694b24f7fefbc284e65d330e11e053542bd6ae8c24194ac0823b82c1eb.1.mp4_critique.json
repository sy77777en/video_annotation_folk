    "pre_caption": "The video features a clear glass mug filled with a layered coffee beverage, likely a latte, characterized by distinct layers of milk foam, coffee, and milk. The mug has a handle and a small red label on its side. The beverage is topped with a small amount of foam, and the glass is positioned on a dark countertop. The focus on the mug and its contents highlights the visual appeal of the layered drink.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption is good, but it can be improved. Here is a detailed breakdown of its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the main subject as a \"clear glass mug filled with a layered coffee beverage\" and accurately describes its components (\"milk foam, coffee, and milk\"), the handle, the red label, and the dark countertop.\n*   The description of the foam as a \"small amount\" is slightly inaccurate. The foam constitutes a significant portion of the drink, roughly the top quarter, so describing it as a \"thick layer\" would be more precise.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The description is mostly complete but omits a couple of visual details:\n    *   It fails to mention the small, white pitcher that is partially visible and out of focus to the right of the mug.\n    *   It doesn't describe the visual texture within the coffee layer, where the milk and coffee are visibly swirling and mixing, indicating the drink was recently prepared.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths:** The caption successfully follows most instructions. It is a single, coherent paragraph, uses simple English, avoids terms like \"frame,\" and correctly identifies the subject type and its key attributes.\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   The caption violates the instruction to **\"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\"** The final sentence, \"The focus on the mug and its contents highlights the visual appeal of the layered drink,\" is an interpretation of the shot's purpose and uses the subjective term \"visual appeal.\" The description should stick to objective visual facts.\n\n### Revised Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised version of the caption that incorporates the feedback and adheres more closely to all instructions:\n\nA clear glass mug with a handle sits on a dark surface. It is filled with a layered coffee beverage, with a white, milky layer at the bottom, a light-brown mixture of coffee and milk in the middle, and a thick layer of white foam on top. The coffee and milk in the middle layer are visibly swirling together. A small, red, shield-shaped logo is on the side of the mug. To the right, a small, out-of-focus white pitcher is partially visible.",
