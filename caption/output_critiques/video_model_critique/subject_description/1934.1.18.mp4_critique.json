    "pre_caption": "The video features a group of five individuals, all dressed in white protective suits with hoods, gathered around a screen. One of the individuals, distinguishable by a red top hat, stands slightly apart and appears taller than the others. The screen they are observing displays a small, white silhouette of a person. The individuals are closely focused on the screen, suggesting an interest or engagement with the content displayed. The scene conveys a sense of uniformity and attention among the group.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption is a good attempt, but it has some inaccuracies and does not fully adhere to the provided instructions. Here is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption incorrectly states there are \"five individuals, all dressed in white protective suits.\" There are only four individuals in the room wearing white suits. The fifth individual is a small figure displayed on the screen and is not wearing a suit. This is a significant factual error.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The description of the figure on the screen as a \"silhouette\" is slightly inaccurate. A silhouette is typically a dark shape against a light background. Here, it is a light-colored figure on a dark background. \"A small, white figure of a person\" would be more precise.\n*   The color of the top hat is described as \"red,\" which is acceptable, but a more specific term like \"burgundy\" or \"maroon\" would be more descriptive.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violation of \"No Speculation\":** The caption includes interpretive phrases.\n    *   \"...suggesting an interest or engagement with the content displayed.\" You are inferring their mental state (\"interest,\" \"engagement\") from their posture. The instruction is to describe only what is visible. A more objective description would be that they are \"gathered around and looking at the screen.\"\n    *   \"The scene conveys a sense of uniformity and attention among the group.\" This is an interpretation of the scene's overall mood and feeling. The instruction is to focus on describing the subjects and their attributes, not the atmosphere they create. The \"uniformity\" comes from their identical suits, which is a visual attribute that should be stated directly, while \"attention\" is another inferred mental state.\n\n**Summary of Feedback:**\n\nThe caption successfully identifies the main subjects and their key features, such as the white suits and the red top hat. However, it fails on a key point of accuracy by miscounting the number of people in suits. Furthermore, it violates the core instruction to avoid speculation and interpretation by describing the subjects' inferred mental states (\"interest,\" \"engagement,\" \"attention\") and the overall \"sense\" of the scene, rather than sticking strictly to observable visual facts. To improve, the caption must correct the number of individuals in suits and replace interpretive language with objective descriptions of their actions and appearance.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a white room, four individuals dressed in identical white protective suits with hoods are gathered around a monitor. One of the individuals, who is taller than the others, wears a burgundy top hat over their hood. The group is looking at the monitor, which has a black screen displaying a small, white figure of a person with one arm raised.",
