    "pre_caption": "This video presents a forest scenery shot from the first-person perspective of someone walking across a long suspension bridge high up in a dense canopy of towering, thick-trunked trees. The bridge features a narrow wooden plank walkway, flanked on both sides by high, woven rope netting that serves as a railing. In the distance, other wooden platforms and smaller connecting bridges can be seen built around the massive trees, forming an extensive treetop walkway. There is no main subject in this shot; instead, the focus is on conveying the immersive experience and the grand scale of the forest environment from an elevated viewpoint. The camera's steady forward motion along the bridge draws the viewer into the scene, emphasizing the atmosphere of being suspended amidst the ancient trees.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains an unnecessary introductory phrase, \"This video presents,\" which should be deleted. The phrase \"of someone walking\" is an assumption about an unseen subject and should be removed; describing the shot as being \"from a first-person perspective\" is sufficient. The final two sentences are redundant and contain subjective interpretations like \"immersive experience\" and \"draws the viewer into the scene,\" which should be avoided. These sentences should be combined and rephrased to be more objective and concise. For instance, a better concluding sentence would be: \"There is no main subject, as the focus is on the grand scale of the forest environment from an elevated viewpoint, emphasized by the steady forward motion along the bridge.\"",
