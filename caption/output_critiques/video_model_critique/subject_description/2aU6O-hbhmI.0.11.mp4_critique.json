The scene includes numerous high-rise buildings, construction cranes, and a vibrant sky transitioning from day to night. The emphasis is on the overall atmosphere and scale of the city rather than any specific object, highlighting the dynamic and expansive nature of the urban landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

    "initial_feedback": "You should not mention \"vibrant sky transitioning from day to night\", because the time is the same, and the camera pans left to transition to directly face the sunset. An I would not mention the \"dynamic\" because there are only few subjects or small parts of the frame moves.",
    "gpt_feedback": "The phrase \"vibrant sky transitioning from day to night\" should be reconsidered, as the time remains constant, and the camera simply pans left to face the sunset directly.

  "generated_critique": "The caption is excellent and adheres to all the provided instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the content as a \"cityscape scenery shot\" and accurately describes its key components: a \"sprawling urban environment,\" \"sunset,\" \"high-rise buildings,\" \"construction cranes,\" and the \"interplay of natural and artificial light.\"\n\n**Completeness:** The description is complete for a scenery shot. It successfully captures the essence of the video by focusing on the overall scene rather than trying to isolate a specific subject. It correctly notes that the emphasis is on the \"atmosphere and scale of the city,\" which is the primary focus of the footage.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows the instructions perfectly:\n*   **Scenery Shot Protocol:** It correctly identifies the video as a scenery shot and provides the required explanation for why there is no main subject, stating, \"The emphasis is on the overall atmosphere and scale of the city rather than any specific object.\"\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The description is a single, fluent paragraph that is both concise and easy to understand.\n*   **Descriptive Language:** It uses appropriate descriptive language (\"sprawling,\" \"vibrant\") without being overly subjective or emotional.\n*   **Formatting and Prohibited Terms:** It avoids using terms like \"image\" or \"video\" within the description itself and is presented as a single paragraph without extra formatting.\n*   **Objectivity:** The description remains objective, focusing on what is visually present in the scene.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is a dynamic cityscape scenery shot, captured from a wide-angle, aerial perspective that swoops through a sprawling urban environment at sunset. The view encompasses numerous high-rise buildings and towering construction cranes, set against a vibrant sky where the fading natural light mingles with the city's artificial glow. As there is no single focal point, the emphasis is on the overall scale and energetic atmosphere of the city, highlighting the expansive and constantly evolving nature of the urban landscape.",
