    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text.",

  "generated_critique": "**Feedback on the Caption:**\n\nThe provided caption is excellent and adheres to all the given instructions.\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description is perfectly accurate. The subject is correctly identified as a woman with a prosthetic left leg, standing on a skateboard. Her clothing (white tank top, pants, beanie) and the presence of her reflection are all factually correct based on the video.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is comprehensive, capturing all the most salient details of the subject. It describes her key physical attribute (the prosthetic leg), her attire, her pose, and the object she is on (the skateboard). Including the detail about her reflection adds a significant layer of visual information that is crucial to the scene.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Concise and Informative:** The caption is brief yet provides a full picture of the main subject.\n    *   **Subject-Focused:** It correctly focuses on the woman, describing her attributes in detail while appropriately omitting descriptions of the background cityscape, which is not the primary focus.\n    *   **Objective Language:** The description uses neutral, objective language (e.g., \"light skin,\" \"white,\" \"standing\") and avoids any subjective or emotional terms.\n    *   **Proper Formatting:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or markdown, as instructed.\n    *   **Clarity:** The language is simple and clear, making it easy to understand and visualize the scene. It correctly identifies the subject type (\"woman\") and distinguishes between the person and her reflection.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the instructions. It is accurate, detailed, and well-written. No improvements are necessary.",
