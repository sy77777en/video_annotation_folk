    "pre_caption": "The video features a group of seven people on a red sports court, engaged in a circle formation. The subjects include a man in a green jacket and white pants holding a basketball, a woman in a purple dress, a man in an orange hoodie, a man in a blue jacket, a man in a light blue outfit, a woman with long hair wearing a blue cap, and a man in a brown shirt. The basketball, initially held by the man in the green jacket, becomes the focal point as it transitions to the foreground, revealing a face imprinted on its surface. The transition highlights the basketball's unique design, shifting the viewer's focus from the group interaction to the ball itself.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **switching from one to another**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the transition occurs, whether through subject movement or camera movement.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the number of subjects and the main action involving the basketball's transformation. However, it lacks the specific visual details required by the instructions. The description of the people is too general, omitting details about their clothing. The term \"imprinted\" is not entirely accurate, as the face on the basketball is three-dimensional and molded, not a flat print. Furthermore, the final sentence is interpretive (\"highlights the basketball's unique design, shifting the viewer's focus\") rather than descriptive. To improve, the caption should add specific details about the clothing of the central person (green sweatshirt, white pants) and the group (colorful casual wear). It should also describe the transition more visually by mentioning that the background blurs. Finally, it should use a more precise term like \"molded\" for the face and describe its three-dimensional nature and subtle animation, such as the eyes and mouth opening.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a high-angle view, a group of seven people stands in a circle on a red, fenced-in sports court. In the center, a person wearing a green sweatshirt and white pants holds a basketball up, as if to shoot. The surrounding people, dressed in colorful casual wear (including yellow, blue, purple, and orange sweatshirts), watch them. As the basketball is tossed into the air, the camera zooms in on it, causing the people and the court in the background to become blurry. The basketball comes into sharp focus in the foreground, revealing a three-dimensional, human-like face molded onto its surface. The face's eyes and mouth then slowly open.",
