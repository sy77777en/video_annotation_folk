    "pre_caption": "This is a scenery shot of a dimly lit, futuristic industrial interior. The room is constructed from gray, metallic panels, with a large, rounded window on the left emitting an ominous red glow. In the background, a bright blue holographic console casts a stark light on a workstation, contrasting with the surrounding gloom. The video lacks a central subject, as the camera's slow pan is designed to establish the environment's tense and mysterious atmosphere. The focus is on the interplay of light and shadow, the functional yet worn state of the room, and the sense of place rather than on any specific character or object. Details like a flashing red light on a wall panel, a fire extinguisher, and scattered debris on the floor contribute to the scene's lived-in, slightly distressed feel.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly uses subjective and emotional adjectives such as \"ominous,\" \"stark,\" \"tense,\" \"mysterious,\" \"lived-in,\" and \"distressed feel,\" which violates the instruction to avoid them. The sentence \"the camera's slow pan is designed to establish the environment's tense and mysterious atmosphere\" is an interpretation of the creator's intent, which should be avoided. The description is also missing a key detail: a \"STOP\" sign is visible through the red-lit window on the left. To improve the caption, remove all subjective and interpretive language. Instead of describing the \"feel\" or \"atmosphere,\" focus on a factual description of the scene's elements. Add the detail about the \"STOP\" sign. The explanation for why it's a scenery shot should be more direct, stating that the focus is on the environment itself, its contrasting light sources, and its worn condition, rather than on any specific character or object.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is a scenery shot of a dimly lit, industrial-style interior. The room is constructed from gray, metallic panels. On the left, a large, rounded window emits a red glow, and a \"STOP\" sign is visible through it. In the background, a bright blue holographic console illuminates a workstation, contrasting with the darker areas of the room. The video lacks a central subject, as the camera's slow pan focuses on the environment itself. The shot highlights the contrasting light sources, the worn condition of the room, and its overall layout, rather than a specific character or action. Additional details include a flashing red light on a wall panel, a fire extinguisher, and scattered debris on the floor, indicating a state of disrepair.",
