    "pre_caption": "The video features a person wearing a dark, full-body spacesuit with a helmet that has a clear visor. The helmet reflects light, revealing the person's face inside, which appears focused and intent. The spacesuit is detailed with various panels and fastenings, suggesting a high-tech design. The person is oriented slightly to the side, with their head turned to the right, indicating attentiveness to something outside the frame. The lighting is dim, casting shadows that accentuate the contours of the suit and helmet.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on this caption. It is well-written, detailed, and closely follows the provided instructions. Here is a detailed breakdown of the feedback.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is highly accurate in its description. It correctly identifies the subject as a person in a spacesuit, the presence of a helmet with a clear visor, the reflection on the visor revealing the face, and the person's orientation.\n*   The description of the expression as \"focused and intent\" is a reasonable and objective interpretation of the visual information.\n*   The only minor point of contention is describing the spacesuit as \"dark.\" While the scene's low-key lighting makes it appear dark overall, the suit itself has significant white or light-colored components. A more precise description might mention the contrast between light and dark sections.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The description is very complete, covering the subject's attire, pose, and the effect of the lighting.\n*   It successfully captures the most salient details of the scene.\n*   For slightly more completeness, you could specify the subject's gender. The facial features visible through the visor are clearly those of a man.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph.\n*   **Subject Identification:** The caption uses \"person.\" The instructions ask for precise terms like \"man\" or \"woman.\" Identifying the subject as a \"man\" would be a better adherence to this specific rule.\n*   **Visual Attributes:** The description of the suit, helmet, and pose is excellent. It uses specific and descriptive language without being overly verbose.\n*   **Objectivity:** The caption does a great job of avoiding overly subjective or emotional language. \"Focused and intent\" are good descriptors that are grounded in the visual evidence of the person's gaze and expression.\n*   **Formatting:** The caption correctly avoids introductory text and markdown, presenting only the single descriptive paragraph.\n*   **Focus:** The focus remains squarely on the main subject, as instructed, without getting distracted by the background.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThis is a very strong caption that demonstrates a clear understanding of the instructions. It is accurate, well-structured, and descriptive. The primary areas for improvement are minor refinements: specifying the subject's gender for greater precision and slightly adjusting the color description of the spacesuit to be more nuanced. Otherwise, it is an exemplary execution of the task.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features a man wearing a full-body spacesuit with white and dark components and a helmet with a clear visor. The helmet's visor reflects light, revealing the man's face inside, which appears focused and intent. The spacesuit is detailed with various panels and fastenings, suggesting a high-tech design. He is oriented slightly to the side, with his head turned to the right, indicating attentiveness to something outside the frame. The lighting is dim, casting deep shadows that accentuate the contours of the suit and helmet.",
