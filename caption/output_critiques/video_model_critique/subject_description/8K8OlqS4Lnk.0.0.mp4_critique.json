Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption adheres to all instructions and provides a high-quality description of the video.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the video as a landscape scenery shot and accurately describes its main components: a rainbow, a cloudy sky, green trees, and a street scene.\n*   A minor point of improvement for even greater accuracy would be to note that it is a *double* rainbow, as a second, fainter arc is visible above the primary one, especially at the beginning of the video. However, describing it as \"a vibrant rainbow\" is not incorrect, as the primary one is the most prominent.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The description is very complete for a scenery shot. It successfully captures the overall atmosphere and key visual elements revealed during the camera's pan.\n*   It correctly includes details like the power lines and the distant mountain, astutely noting their function in creating a sense of scale and depth.\n*   It appropriately omits minor details like the specific car on the street, which keeps the focus on the overall landscape as instructed.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Scenery Shot Protocol:** The caption perfectly follows the specific instructions for a scenery shot. It correctly identifies the type of shot and provides a clear, well-reasoned explanation for why there is no single main subject, focusing instead on the environment and atmosphere.\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The description is written in a single, fluent paragraph using simple, natural English. It is both concise and informative.\n*   **Objectivity:** The caption successfully avoids overly emotional or subjective language. Adjectives like \"vibrant\" and \"lush\" are appropriately descriptive of the visual qualities without imparting personal feelings.\n*   **Formatting and Prohibited Terms:** The caption is a single paragraph without any introductory text or markdown, and it correctly avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" It also effectively describes the entire scene revealed by the camera's motion without explicitly mentioning the pan itself.\n\nIn summary, this is an exemplary caption that demonstrates a thorough understanding and application of all the provided guidelines, especially the nuanced rules for describing scenery.",
