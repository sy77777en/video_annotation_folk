    "pre_caption": "This video is a dynamic architectural scenery shot capturing the interior of a modern, empty subway station. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the striking design, atmosphere, and scale of the urban environment. The disorienting, tilted camera perspective sweeps along a deserted platform, where dramatic blue uplighting casts long shadows against a wall, leading the eye towards a dark tunnel. A large, curved overhead structure with bold yellow and black stripes provides a strong visual contrast. A brightly lit digital sign displays the time as approximately 7:35, indicates \"Gleis 1\" (Track 1), and shows an \"SOS Nothalt\" (Emergency Stop) button, grounding the surreal scene with functional details.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

The caption states the \"large, curved overhead structures features rounded, hooded lights in yellow, orange, and blue,\" but the structures themselves are dark blue with prominent yellow stripes, a key visual attribute that is omitted. The lights under these structures are blueish-white, not multicolored; the yellow and orange light originates from other signs further down the platform. Additionally, the caption uses subjective adjectives like \"striking,\" \"dramatic,\" and \"surreal,\" which should be removed to maintain objectivity as per the instructions.",
