    "pre_caption": "This video captures a dramatic landscape scenery shot, depicting a vast, flat plain of green and yellow grass under an immense, turbulent sky. The scene is dominated by massive, dark grey storm clouds that swirl and gather, with curtains of rain visibly falling in the distance. A single, small tree stands alone in the middle of the expansive field, appearing small and isolated against the powerful backdrop. The primary focus is on the powerful, ominous atmosphere and the sheer scale of the natural environment, rather than on a specific subject, using the lone tree to emphasize the vastness of the landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the video as a landscape scenery shot and correctly describes its key components. However, it violates the instruction to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions\" by using the words \"dramatic,\" \"powerful,\" and \"ominous.\" Furthermore, the final sentence is overly explanatory and could be more concise. The caption should be revised to remove these subjective adjectives and to streamline the explanation for why there is no main subject. For example, the description of the atmosphere and the tree's role can be integrated more directly into the scenic description rather than being stated as a separate analytical point.",

A single, small tree stands isolated in the middle of the expansive field, its solitary placement emphasizing the vastness of the landscape and the scale of the storm.",
