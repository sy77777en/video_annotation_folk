    "pre_caption": "The video is an aerial landscape scenery shot focusing on a vast expanse of icebergs floating in dark water. The emphasis is on the environment and atmosphere, showcasing the contrast between the bright white ice and the deep, dark water. The icebergs have irregular shapes, with some featuring smooth surfaces and others having jagged edges. The water appears calm, with a rich, dark hue that highlights the ice's stark whiteness. The video captures the scale and majesty of the natural setting, rather than focusing on a specific object, creating a sense of vastness and isolation.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly identifies the animals as \"likely penguins\" when they are clearly seals, identifiable by their elongated, finned bodies lying flat on the ice. The instruction states to focus on salient non-human subjects, but the caption misclassifies the video as a scenery shot and downplays the large, congregated group of seals, which is a primary subject. The description of the animals as \"scattered\" is also inaccurate; they are clustered together in a dense group. The caption should be rewritten to focus on the seals, describing their key visual attributes (dark, elongated bodies) and their arrangement on the iceberg. Additionally, the subjective words \"beautiful\" and \"majesty\" should be removed. The sentences explaining the focus on the environment are redundant once the seals are correctly identified as the main subject and should be deleted for conciseness.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is an aerial, top-down shot of a large group of seals clustered on a white iceberg floating in dark water. The seals, which have dark, elongated bodies, are gathered in a dense group on the ice. A separate iceberg is visible nearby, featuring a pool of turquoise meltwater on its surface. The camera maintains a static high-angle view, emphasizing the contrast between the dark water, the white ice, and the group of seals.",
