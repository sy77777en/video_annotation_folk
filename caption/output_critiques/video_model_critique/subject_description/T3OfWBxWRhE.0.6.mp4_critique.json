    "pre_caption": "This video is an architectural scenery shot capturing a grand, neoclassical building under a vast, cloudy sky. The symmetrical structure, made of light-colored stone, is defined by a central portico with imposing columns and two extensive wings lined with rectangular windows. Positioned in the foreground is a tall, white cenotaph adorned with a carved wreath, standing before a wide staircase that ascends to the building's entrance. The absence of a specific main subject allows the focus to rest entirely on the impressive scale and stately atmosphere of the architectural environment. The composition emphasizes the building's grandeur and its role as a significant landmark rather than any individual element. The low, moving perspective further enhances the sense of scale and monumentality.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is mostly accurate but could be improved by adhering more strictly to the instructions regarding objectivity and conciseness. The description uses several subjective adjectives such as \"grand,\" \"imposing,\" \"impressive,\" and \"stately,\" as well as interpretive nouns like \"grandeur\" and \"monumentality.\" These should be replaced with more neutral, descriptive terms like \"large.\" The phrase \"significant landmark\" is an inference about the building's status, which is not directly visible and should be omitted. The color of the building is described as \"light-colored stone,\" but a more specific description like \"light pink\" or \"pinkish-beige stone\" would be more accurate. Finally, the last sentence mentions the \"moving perspective,\" which violates the instruction to avoid describing motion unless necessary. The final two sentences are also overly analytical and should be replaced with a single, more concise sentence that explains why the video is a scenery shot, focusing on the lack of a main subject and the emphasis on the architectural environment.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video is an architectural scenery shot of a large, neoclassical building under a cloudy sky. The symmetrical structure, made of pinkish-beige stone, features a central portico with columns and two wings lined with rectangular windows. In the foreground, a tall, white cenotaph with a carved wreath stands before a wide staircase leading to the building's entrance. This is an architectural scenery shot because there is no main subject, placing the focus on the architectural environment as a whole.",
