    "pre_caption": "The video features two prominent celestial bodies. The first is a reddish-brown planet with a textured surface, characterized by craters and dark patches, indicative of Mars. Accompanying it is a small, irregularly shaped gray object resembling an asteroid or moon. The second celestial body is a vibrant blue and green planet, displaying swirling white cloud formations, clearly representing Earth. The video transitions from the reddish-brown planet with its companion object to the colorful depiction of Earth, highlighting the distinct visual characteristics of each planet.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on the caption. It is well-written, descriptive, and follows most of the instructions. Here is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is highly accurate in its description of the celestial bodies. It correctly identifies the first planet as resembling Mars due to its \"reddish-brown\" color and \"craters,\" and the second as Earth due to its \"blue and green\" colors and \"swirling white cloud formations.\"\n*   The description of the smaller object as a \"small, irregularly shaped gray object resembling an asteroid or moon\" is also precise and correct.\n*   The main point of inaccuracy is the opening sentence: \"The video features two prominent celestial bodies.\" The video actually shows one planet *transforming* from a Mars-like state into an Earth-like state. It doesn't feature two separate planets. This creates a slight contradiction with the final sentence, which correctly describes the transition.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully captures the essential elements of the video: the initial state of the planet, the accompanying small object, the final state of the planet, and the transition between them.\n*   It provides sufficient detail on the visual attributes (color, texture, features) of each state of the planet.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is concise and easy to understand.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It uses precise terms like \"planet,\" \"asteroid,\" and \"moon.\"\n*   **Visual Attributes:** It effectively describes the key visual characteristics of the subjects.\n*   **Structure:** It is a single, coherent paragraph and avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Objectivity:** The language is mostly objective. \"Vibrant\" is slightly subjective but works well here as a descriptor of the strong colors.\n*   **Transition Description:** The caption correctly identifies and describes the core action of the video, which is the transition.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is very good but has one key area for improvement. The framing of the content as \"two prominent celestial bodies\" is misleading. The video's narrative is about the transformation of a single object.\n\n**To improve the caption, you could rephrase the beginning to focus on the transformation itself:**\n\n*   **Suggested revision:** \"The video shows a reddish-brown planet, resembling Mars, accompanied by a small, gray, irregular object like an asteroid or moon. The planet then undergoes a smooth transformation, as blue oceans fill its surface, landmasses turn green, and white clouds form, eventually turning it into a lush, Earth-like world. The transition highlights a dramatic change from a barren, cratered landscape to a vibrant, life-sustaining planet.\"\n\nThis revised version immediately establishes the core concept of transformation, resolving the minor contradiction in the original caption and providing a more accurate summary of the video's content.",
