    "pre_caption": "This is a landscape scenery shot of an airfield under a partly cloudy sky. A large, complex wooden contraption, resembling a catapult or launch system, occupies the foreground on dry, grassy ground beside a wide asphalt runway. A small, vintage-style biplane is positioned at the end of the structure, seemingly ready for launch. The wide-angle perspective captures the expansive environment, including distant buildings and mountains, emphasizing the scale of the scene rather than focusing on a single subject. The focus is on establishing the setting and the relationship between the various elements within the vast, open space.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly classifies this as a \"landscape scenery shot\" where the focus is on the environment. The large, detailed wooden contraption in the foreground is a salient subject, and the description should be centered on it. Consequently, the last two sentences, which justify the scenery classification by mentioning the wide-angle perspective and the focus on the setting, are inaccurate and should be removed. Additionally, the caption omits a key element of the contraption: a dark, spherical object, resembling a bowling ball, positioned at the start of a wooden ramp in the lower-left foreground. The description should begin by describing the wooden contraption and its components, including the suspended biplane, the white bag, and the spherical object, before briefly mentioning the airfield setting for context.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A large, complex wooden contraption, resembling a catapult or launch system, dominates the foreground. Positioned at the start of a wooden ramp in the lower-left is a dark, spherical object, like a bowling ball. The structure supports a small, vintage-style biplane at its end, seemingly ready for launch, with a white bag hanging nearby. This entire setup is located on dry, grassy ground beside a wide asphalt runway at an airfield. The scene is set under a partly cloudy sky, with distant buildings and mountains visible in the background.",
