    "pre_caption": "The video shows a dark-colored helicopter hovering in a dark, misty environment, with its landing skids visible. A bright spotlight shines down from the helicopter, illuminating a person standing directly below. The person is wearing light-colored clothing and appears to be looking upwards or holding an object that reflects the light. The scene is dimly lit, with the spotlight creating a strong contrast between the illuminated area and the surrounding darkness.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on the caption. It is accurate, complete, and adheres strictly to all the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies a \"dark-colored helicopter\" and a \"person\" as the main subjects.\n*   The description of the helicopter \"hovering\" and the \"bright spotlight\" shining down is precise.\n*   The observation that the person is wearing \"light-colored clothing\" and the cautious description of their action (\"appears to be looking upwards or holding an object\") is perfectly judged, accurately reflecting the visual ambiguity in the video.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is very complete, capturing all the essential elements of the scene. It describes both subjects, their interaction via the spotlight, and the overall lighting and atmosphere (\"dark, misty environment,\" \"strong contrast\").\n*   It successfully includes key details like the helicopter's \"landing skids\" without becoming overly verbose.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is a single, fluent paragraph that is both concise and highly informative.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** It correctly focuses on the salient subjects (\"helicopter,\" \"person\") and avoids getting sidetracked by the indistinct background elements.\n*   **Objectivity:** The language is descriptive and objective, avoiding subjective or emotional terms. The use of \"appears to be\" is a perfect example of following the instruction to \"avoid describing what you are unsure about.\"\n*   **Formatting:** The output is a single paragraph without any introductory text or markdown, exactly as requested.\n*   **Proper Terminology:** It uses precise terms for the subjects and avoids vague words.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe caption is exemplary. It demonstrates a thorough understanding of the instructions and applies them perfectly to the visual content. There are no areas that require correction or improvement.",
