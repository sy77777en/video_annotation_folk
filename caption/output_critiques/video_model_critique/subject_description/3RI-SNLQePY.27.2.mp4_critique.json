    "pre_caption": "The video features a dimly lit, monochromatic interior with a man and a woman. The man, dressed in a dark suit, is positioned on the left side, walking towards the center. He has a medium build and short hair. The woman, on the right, is wearing a light-colored dress and has long hair. She appears to be standing still, facing the center. The setting includes a reception desk, a coat rack, and several chandeliers, creating a vintage atmosphere. The text \"The elevator is out of order\" and \"The phone is ringing\" is visible, suggesting a narrative element.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly inaccurate in its description of the subjects.\n*   The main, walking character is described as a \"man, dressed in a dark suit.\" This is incorrect. The character is wearing a light-colored (white) top, possibly a hoodie or jacket, over dark pants and light-colored shoes.\n*   The secondary figure is described as a \"woman, on the right... wearing a light-colored dress and has long hair.\" This is a complete fabrication. The figure on the right is a very dark, indistinct, shadowy silhouette. Its gender, clothing, and hairstyle are impossible to discern from the video.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption misses several key visual details while including less important ones.\n*   It fails to mention the most prominent colored element in the monochromatic scene: the red, bloody footprints on the checkered floor.\n*   It mentions a \"coat rack\" but omits its unique, spidery, and unsettling design, which is a significant feature.\n*   It correctly notes the chandeliers and reception desk but misses the large, grand staircase in the background.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption fails to adhere to several core instructions.\n*   **\"You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\"** The caption violates this rule by inventing specific, incorrect details for both characters (the \"dark suit\" and the \"woman in a light-colored dress\").\n*   **\"Describe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language.\"** While the language used is specific, it is factually wrong, which makes the description misleading rather than helpful.\n*   **\"Clearly identify each subject’s type...\"** The caption assigns genders (\"man,\" \"woman\") to the figures when their gender is ambiguous, especially for the shadowy figure on the right. A more appropriate term would have been \"person\" or \"figure.\"\n\n**Strengths:**\n*   The caption correctly follows the structural requirements: it is a single, coherent paragraph, avoids forbidden terms like \"image,\" and uses natural English.\n*   It accurately identifies the setting as a \"dimly lit, monochromatic interior\" with a \"vintage atmosphere.\"\n*   It correctly notes the presence and content of the on-screen text (\"The elevator is out of order\" and \"The phone is ringing\") and rightly suggests it adds a narrative element.\n\nIn summary, while the caption follows the formatting guidelines and correctly identifies the setting and on-screen text, its fundamental failure to accurately describe the main subjects and its invention of non-existent details make it a poor and misleading description of the video's content.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a high-angle perspective, a figure wearing a light-colored hooded jacket, dark pants, and light-colored shoes walks through a dimly lit, monochromatic lobby. The grand, vintage-style interior features a black-and-white checkered floor stained with red, bloody footprints. To the left is a reception desk and an unsettling, spidery coat rack. In the background, a large staircase ascends into darkness, and several ornate chandeliers cast a faint glow. On the right, a dark, shadowy silhouette stands motionless. Text at the bottom of the screen reads, \"The elevator is out of order,\" followed by, \"The phone is ringing.\"",
