    "pre_caption": "This is a dramatic landscape scenery shot capturing a powerful thunderstorm over a vast canyon at night. Under a partially starry sky, massive, dark storm clouds gather, periodically erupting in brilliant flashes of lightning that illuminate the deep, layered rock formations of the canyon below. A distinct column of rain is visible within the storm, and a single, sharp bolt of lightning strikes down, while a mysterious, steady orange glow persists on the distant horizon. The video lacks a main subject, as its purpose is to convey the immense scale and awe-inspiring power of the natural environment and the atmospheric drama of the storm itself.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the scene as a landscape and correctly describes the key visual elements, such as the thunderstorm, canyon, lightning, rain column, and the orange glow. However, the description violates the instruction to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions\" by using words like \"dramatic,\" \"powerful,\" \"mysterious,\" and \"awe-inspiring,\" as well as the noun \"drama.\" These words should be removed to maintain objectivity. For example, \"a dramatic landscape scenery shot\" should be \"a landscape scenery shot,\" and \"a mysterious, steady orange glow\" should be \"a steady orange glow.\" Additionally, the final sentence explaining the lack of a subject could be more concise and objective by removing the phrases \"awe-inspiring power\" and \"atmospheric drama.\" A better phrasing would be: \"The video lacks a main subject, as the focus is on the scale of the natural environment and the atmospheric event.\"",
