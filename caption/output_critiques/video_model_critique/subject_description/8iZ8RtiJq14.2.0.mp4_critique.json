    "pre_caption": "The video shows a close-up of a brown, textured corkboard. Several red, twisted strings radiate from a central point on the board, held in place by a red, round-headed thumbtack. Pinned beneath the thumbtack is a small, square, light blue paper card with the words \"UNCLE JERRY\" written in black, block capital letters. Subsequently, a small, square, red paper card appears to the right of the light blue card, also seemingly connected by the strings. This red card displays the text \"JEROME JACOBSON\" in black, block capital letters.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a close-up of a corkboard with red strings with several red strings crossing each other, meeting at a central point where a white card is fixed. The white card displays the text \"UNCLE JERRY.\" A red card then appears next to the white card, showing the text \"JEROME JACOBSON.\"**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback on the caption is as follows:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is perfectly accurate. It correctly identifies all the visual elements, including the brown corkboard, the red thumbtack, the radiating red strings, and the two paper cards. The text on each card (\"UNCLE JERRY\" and \"JEROME JACOBSON\") and their respective colors (light blue and red) are also described correctly.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is very complete. It captures not only the static elements of the scene but also the key action: the appearance of the second, red paper card. It provides sufficient detail on the attributes of each object, such as the twisted nature of the strings and the block capital letters of the text.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres to all instructions flawlessly.\n*   It is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English.\n*   It correctly identifies subject types (\"corkboard,\" \"strings,\" \"thumbtack,\" \"paper card\").\n*   It provides detailed descriptions of visual attributes (color, texture, shape, text).\n*   It avoids subjective language and does not speculate on information not present.\n*   It describes the transition of the second card appearing (\"Subsequently... appears\") without referring to specific frames.\n*   The structure is logical, describing the static background and central elements before detailing the cards and the change that occurs.",
