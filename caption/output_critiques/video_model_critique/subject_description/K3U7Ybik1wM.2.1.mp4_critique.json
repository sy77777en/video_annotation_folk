    "pre_caption": "The video presents a nature scenery shot, specifically a close-up view of a vibrant green meadow dotted with numerous small, bright yellow buttercups and a few tiny white flowers. There is no main subject because the focus is on the overall environment and atmosphere of the flower-filled field, with the camera's shallow depth of field and shifting focus creating a soft, dreamlike quality that emphasizes the collective beauty of the scene rather than singling out any particular flower or element. The gentle sway of the flowers suggests a light breeze, further contributing to the tranquil, natural ambiance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption includes subjective and interpretive language, which violates the instruction to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" Phrases like \"vibrant,\" \"dreamlike quality,\" \"collective beauty,\" \"tranquil,\" and \"natural ambiance\" should be removed. The caption also starts with the unnecessary introductory phrase \"The video presents.\" Furthermore, the explanation for the lack of a main subject is too wordy. The description of the camera's effect and the flowers' movement should be stated more factually and concisely. For instance, instead of describing a \"soft, dreamlike quality that emphasizes the collective beauty,\" simply state that the shallow depth of field and shifting focus blur parts of the scene. The final sentence about the \"ambiance\" should be removed, and the observation about the swaying flowers can be integrated more directly.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A close-up view of a green meadow shows numerous small, yellow buttercups and a few tiny white flowers swaying. The camera uses a shallow depth of field and shifts its focus, blurring parts of the foreground and background. The shot focuses on the overall field of flowers rather than a single main subject.",
