    "pre_caption": "The video features a woman standing in front of a yellow house with a white door. She has short, straight brown hair and is wearing a white short-sleeved shirt and dark high-waisted pants. Her back is to the camera, and she is facing the house, which has a brick chimney and a small garden with red flowers. The house number \"6701\" is visible next to the door. The woman appears to be observing the house, and the door is slightly ajar, suggesting she may be about to enter or has just arrived.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is mostly accurate in its description. The subject is correctly identified as a woman standing in front of a yellow house with a white door. The details about her clothing (white short-sleeved shirt, dark high-waisted pants), her pose (back to the camera, facing the house), and the house features (brick chimney, house number \"6701\") are all correct. However, the woman's hair color is more of a reddish-brown or auburn rather than just \"brown.\"\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe description is reasonably complete but omits a noticeable and distinct subject in the foreground: the garden gnome standing in the flower bed to the left. Including this detail would provide a more thorough picture of the scene.\n\n**Adherence to the Given Instruction:**\nThe caption fails to adhere to several key instructions:\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about\":** The final sentence, \"...suggesting she may be about to enter or has just arrived,\" is a significant violation. This is speculation about the woman's intentions and past or future actions, which the instructions explicitly forbid. The description should be limited to what is visually present.\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid subjective adjectives\":** The phrase \"The woman appears to be observing the house\" is an interpretation of her mental state, not a factual description of her physical posture. A more compliant description would stick to objective facts, such as \"She is standing and facing the house.\"\n\nIn summary, while the caption successfully describes the main subjects and their attributes in a single paragraph, it includes speculation and interpretation, which directly contradicts the core rules of the prompt. A better caption would remove the final sentence entirely and rephrase \"appears to be observing\" to be more objective.",

A brick chimney is visible on the roof. In the front yard, there is a garden with red flowers and a garden gnome on the left, and a large green bush on the right.",
