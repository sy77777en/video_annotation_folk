    "pre_caption": "The video features a wide shot of a laundry room with two people at the center. One person, a man, is seated on a bench, wearing a white shirt, light-colored pants, and a cap, with a relaxed posture. The other person, standing nearby, is holding a laundry basket and wearing a dark outfit. The room has a checkered floor and several washing machines along the walls. Pink text reading \"KODAK ONHA\" appears prominently in the foreground, partially obscuring the people, and seems to be added in post-production.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows a wide shot of a laundry room with two people in the center, the pink text title \"KODAK ONHA\" shows up and covers part of two people, which was added in post-production.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is mostly accurate in its general description of the scene.\n*   **Correction 1:** The caption states the seated person is wearing a \"cap,\" but no cap is visible on their head.\n*   **Correction 2:** The caption identifies the seated person as a \"man,\" but their gender is not discernible from the video. It's better to use a neutral term like \"person.\"\n*   **Correction 3:** The standing person is described as wearing a \"dark outfit.\" This is inaccurate; they are wearing a bright red or orange hooded top.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The description of the text as just \"Pink text\" is incomplete. A key visual attribute is its large, puffy, 3D, balloon-like appearance, which is a significant and unusual feature that should be mentioned.\n*   The description of the standing person's clothing could be more specific (e.g., \"a red hooded top\" instead of \"a dark outfit\").\n*   The description of the seated person's shirt as \"white\" is an assumption, as it is mostly obscured. \"Light-colored shirt\" would be more appropriate.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Subject Prioritization:** The instructions state to begin with the \"largest or most centered subject.\" The large, pink, floating text is the most prominent and central element, yet the caption begins by describing the people. The text should be described first.\n*   **Describing the Unseen:** The caption violates the rule \"avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about\" by identifying a \"cap\" that isn't there and assigning a gender (\"man\") that cannot be confirmed.\n*   **Background Description:** The caption includes details about the background (\"laundry room,\" \"checkered floor,\" \"washing machines\"). The instructions state to \"Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary.\" While it sets the scene, these details are not essential for identifying or distinguishing the primary subjects (the text and the people) and could be omitted for greater conciseness.\n*   **Descriptive Language:** The use of \"dark outfit\" is not the \"specific and descriptive language\" required by the instructions, especially when a more accurate color is visible.\n\n### Revised Caption Example\n\nHere is an example of a revised caption that more closely follows the instructions:\n\nFloating in the center of a room is large, puffy, pink 3D text that reads \"KODAK ONHA.\" Partially obscured by the text are two people. One person, on the left, is seated wearing light-colored pants and dark red shoes. The other person stands near the center, wearing a red hooded top and holding a white laundry basket.",
