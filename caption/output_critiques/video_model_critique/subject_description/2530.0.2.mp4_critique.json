    "pre_caption": "The video features a close-up of a ballet dancer's feet, showcasing the dancer wearing well-worn, light-colored pointe shoes. The shoes have visible scuffs and wear, indicating frequent use. The dancer's feet are positioned en pointe, demonstrating balance and precision. The skin tone of the dancer is visible through the openings of the shoes, and the crossed ribbons are tied securely around the ankles. The focus is on the technical skill and elegance of the dancer's footwork.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is good, but it can be improved in terms of adherence to the instructions, specifically regarding objectivity and completeness.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is accurate. It correctly identifies the subject as a ballet dancer's feet, the type of shoes as pointe shoes, their worn condition, and the \"en pointe\" position.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is reasonably complete but misses one key visual attribute requested by the instructions. While it mentions that the dancer's skin is visible, it fails to describe the skin tone (which appears to be brown). The instructions state to include details like skin tone for people.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Objectivity:** The main issue with the caption is its use of subjective and interpretive language, which the instructions explicitly forbid.\n    *   The phrase \"indicating frequent use\" is an inference, not a direct visual description.\n    *   \"demonstrating balance and precision\" and \"technical skill and elegance\" are interpretations of the dancer's ability and the mood of the video. The instructions require you to describe *what* is visible, not what it implies or demonstrates. For example, instead of \"demonstrating balance,\" you should simply state that the dancer is \"balancing on the tips of their toes.\"\n    *   The final sentence, \"The focus is on the technical skill and elegance of the dancer's footwork,\" is a thematic summary and not a description of visual content. This type of analysis should be avoided.\n*   **Conciseness:** Removing the interpretive phrases would make the description more concise and direct, as per the instructions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption successfully identifies the main subject and its key attributes. However, it violates the core instruction to remain objective and avoid subjective or interpretive language. To improve, the caption should be revised to describe only the visual facts (e.g., \"The dancer stands en pointe\") and remove all analysis of skill, elegance, or what the visual details might indicate. Additionally, it should include the visible skin tone of the dancer to be more complete.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is a close-up shot of a ballet dancer's feet in light-colored, well-worn pointe shoes on a light-colored floor. The shoes have visible scuffs and wear. The dancer, who has brown skin, stands en pointe, balancing on the tips of their toes. Ribbons are crossed over the instep and tied around the ankles.",
