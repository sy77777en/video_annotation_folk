    "pre_caption": "The video features a wide shot of a city street, focusing on a woman walking away from the camera. She is seen from behind, with only her upper body visible. The woman has light-colored hair and is wearing a black coat. The street is lined with tall buildings, and the scene captures the urban environment with its architecture and streetlights. The camera follows her as she walks, maintaining her as the central subject while providing context of the bustling city around her.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A wide shot of a city street, with the camera following a woman from behind as she walks. The video only shows the upper body of the woman, leaving more context for the street scenery.**\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption adheres to all instructions and provides a high-quality description of the video.\n\n### Feedback:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description is perfectly accurate. It correctly identifies the main subject as a woman with light-colored hair in a black coat, walking away from the camera on a city street. All details mentioned, including the tall buildings, streetlights, and the camera's movement, are present in the video.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is comprehensive. It successfully captures the most important visual information: the primary subject, her key attributes and action, the environmental context, and the relationship between the camera and the subject. It provides enough detail to form a clear mental picture without being overly cluttered.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Structure and Tone:** The caption is a single, well-written paragraph in simple, natural English, as required. It correctly avoids markdown and introductory phrases.\n    *   **Subject Identification:** It correctly identifies the woman as the salient subject and focuses the description on her, while using the cityscape as necessary context. It uses precise terms like \"woman,\" \"buildings,\" and \"streetlights.\"\n    *   **Descriptive Detail:** The visual attributes (\"light-colored hair,\" \"black coat\") and orientation (\"seen from behind,\" \"walking away\") are described specifically and objectively.\n    *   **Handling of Motion and Background:** The caption correctly includes descriptions of motion (\"walking,\" \"camera follows\") and background (\"tall buildings,\" \"urban environment\") because they are essential for understanding the scene's composition and action, which is permitted by the instructions.\n    *   **Objectivity:** The description avoids subjective emotional language. The word \"bustling\" is used appropriately as a descriptive term for a city with visible traffic and pedestrians.\n    *   **Prohibited Content:** The caption successfully avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame\" and does not speculate on information that isn't visible.\n\nIn summary, the caption is an exemplary response that perfectly balances conciseness with informative detail, following all provided guidelines with precision.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A woman with light-colored hair, seen from behind in a black coat, walks along a sidewalk on a city street. The camera follows her as she moves away, down a long street flanked by tall stone and glass buildings. The sky in the distance is bright and hazy, and ornate, glowing streetlights line the road where a few cars are visible.",
