    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dystopian cityscape scenery shot, focusing on the grand scale of destruction and the oppressive atmosphere rather than a single character or object. The absence of a main subject allows the viewer to take in the full scope of the chaotic event unfolding. The scene is set in a vast, monochromatic city defined by a mix of ornate, classical architecture and towering, futuristic skyscrapers in the background, all shrouded in a dark, overcast sky. A massive, robed statue is violently toppled from its pedestal, crashing into a large circular plaza filled with swarming, indistinct dark figures and punctuated by small explosions. The air is thick with smoke and debris, conveying a powerful sense of a city under a massive assault.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly states that the video focuses on the scenery \"rather than a single character or object\" and omits a key subject. The video clearly shows a fast-moving, winged creature crashing into the statue, which is the direct cause of its fall. The description should be revised to include this salient subject and its action. Additionally, the sentences \"The absence of a main subject allows the viewer to take in the full scope of the chaotic event unfolding\" and \"...conveying a powerful sense of a city under a massive assault\" are either redundant or overly interpretive and should be removed to maintain conciseness and objectivity. The description should begin by describing the action involving the creature and the statue, as this is the central event of the clip.",
