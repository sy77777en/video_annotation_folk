    "pre_caption": "This video presents an aquatic interior scenery shot, capturing a view from a low perspective at the surface of murky, green water within an enclosed tank. The environment is defined by stark, white-tiled walls under the bright, diffuse light of several small, high windows. The shot lacks a singular main subject, as the immersive viewpoint emphasizes the claustrophobic atmosphere and the unsettling quality of the confined space itself. The focus is on the overall environment rather than on the dark, curved form breaking the rippling surface in the foreground or the red and white object floating in the distance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly classifies the video as a scenery shot and dismisses the visible subjects. The instruction requires focusing on salient subjects, and the dark, curved form in the foreground is a clear, prominent subject that should be described in detail. The caption also violates the instruction to avoid subjective language by using terms like \"claustrophobic atmosphere\" and \"unsettling quality.\" The description of the red object as a \"pipe entrance\" is speculative. The paragraph should be rewritten to focus on describing the subjects. It should begin by describing the dark, curved form in the foreground, noting its smooth texture and partial submersion, and then describe the red and white circular object floating in the background. The description of the environment (tiled walls, windows, green water) is accurate and can be retained but should follow the description of the main subjects.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video, shot from a low perspective at the surface of the water, focuses on a dark, smooth, curved form breaking the rippling surface in the foreground. The object is partially submerged as it moves through the water. In the background, a red and white circular object floats near the far wall. The setting is an enclosed tank with white-tiled walls. Bright, diffuse light enters the space through several small, high windows, illuminating the green water.",
