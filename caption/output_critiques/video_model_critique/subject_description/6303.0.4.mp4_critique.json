The person is wearing a light green sleeve. The smartphone screen initially displays an image of a man with a beard and mustache, wearing a hood, with the text \"KODAK ONHA\" and music player controls visible. Later, the screen shows a colorful graphic with the text \"SUMMER HITS,\" featuring flowers and a cactus, along with an \"Add to Playlist\" button.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "### Feedback on the Caption\n\nThe provided caption is good, but it can be improved in terms of completeness and adherence to specific instructions.\n\n**Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description is factually correct regarding the subjects and actions shown.\n*   **Conciseness and Structure:** The caption is a single, coherent paragraph, as requested. It successfully combines details from the entire video into a sequential narrative.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It correctly identifies the primary subjects (\"hand,\" \"smartphone,\" \"man\") and avoids vague terms.\n*   **Objectivity:** The description uses neutral, objective language and avoids subjective adjectives.\n*   **Focus:** It correctly focuses on the salient subjects (the hand and phone) and omits the out-of-focus background.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n\n*   **Incomplete Details:** The caption misses a few key visual attributes that would make the description more thorough:\n    *   **Hand:** It fails to mention the two prominent, chunky rings on the person's fingers (one yellow, one brownish-orange).\n    *   **Nails:** While it mentions they are \"long, pink-painted,\" it omits the distinct white swirl design on them.\n    *   **Man on Screen:** It misses a very noticeable feature of the man's face: the white, smudged circle drawn around his left eye.\n*   **Clarity of Action:** The final sentence, \"The hand interacts with the screen, indicating a change in the display,\" is a bit general. The video clearly shows a finger tapping specific icons to trigger the change. A more precise description of this cause-and-effect action would be better.\n*   **Word Choice:** The instruction advises against using the word \"image.\" The caption uses the phrase \"displays an image of a man.\" While understandable, it could be rephrased to \"displays a photograph of a man\" or simply describe the man's face appearing on the screen to adhere more strictly to the guidelines.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A close-up shot shows a hand with a medium to dark skin tone holding a smartphone. The hand has long, pink-painted nails with a white swirl design and is adorned with two chunky rings, one yellow and one brownish-orange. The person wears a light green sleeve. Initially, the smartphone screen displays a photograph of a man with a beard and mustache, wearing a hood, with a white, smudged circle drawn around his left eye. Below the photograph, the text \"KODAK ONHA\" and music player controls are visible. A finger taps the plus icon on the screen, causing the display to change to a colorful graphic with the text \"SUMMER HITS\" in bubbly orange letters, surrounded by animated flowers and a cactus against a blue sky with clouds, with an \"Add to Playlist\" button at the bottom.",
