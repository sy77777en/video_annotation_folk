    "pre_caption": "This is a dramatic landscape scenery shot featuring a vast, turbulent sky filled with dark, heavy storm clouds tinged with purple and grey. Visible columns of intense rain pour down from the cloud base, concentrating in the center of the frame over a distant mountain peak. Below, a wide, arid expanse of brownish-green desert scrubland stretches towards the range of dark, rugged mountains on the horizon. There is no main subject, as the focus is on capturing the immense scale and powerful atmosphere of the weather event. The composition emphasizes the dramatic contrast between the violent storm and the sprawling, empty landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the video as a landscape scenery shot and correctly describes the environmental elements. However, it can be improved by adhering more strictly to the instruction to avoid subjective adjectives and interpretive analysis. The caption uses words like \"dramatic,\" \"powerful,\" and \"violent,\" which convey emotion and interpretation rather than objective description. Additionally, the final sentence, \"The composition emphasizes the dramatic contrast between the violent storm and the sprawling, empty landscape,\" is an analysis of the shot's composition, which goes beyond the required descriptive scope. To improve, these subjective terms should be removed, and the final analytical sentence should be deleted to make the description more concise and objective.",
