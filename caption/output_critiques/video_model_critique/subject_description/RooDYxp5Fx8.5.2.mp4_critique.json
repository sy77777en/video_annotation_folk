    "pre_caption": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing a vibrant urban street scene. The focus is on the bustling environment, with a wide road lined by modern buildings on one side and a mix of vehicles, including cars, vans, and buses, moving along the street. Pedestrians walk along the sidewalk, adding to the lively atmosphere. The sky is clear with a few clouds, and distant green hills provide a natural backdrop, enhancing the sense of scale and openness. The emphasis is on the dynamic interaction between the urban elements and the natural surroundings, rather than any specific object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption generally follows the instruction by identifying the video as a cityscape scenery shot and noting the focus on the environment rather than a specific subject. However, it could be improved by specifying that there is only one visible pedestrian, a woman with long dark hair wearing a white mask, black top, and light pants, walking along the sidewalk on the left. The caption should avoid subjective terms like \"vibrant\" and \"lively atmosphere,\" as these are not strictly visual or objective. The mention of \"dynamic interaction\" is also somewhat subjective and unnecessary. The rest of the description about the road, vehicles, buildings, clear sky, and distant green hills is accurate and relevant. To improve, remove subjective language, specify the single pedestrian with visual details, and keep the focus on observable elements.",
