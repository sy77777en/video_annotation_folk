Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the video as an underwater scenery shot but uses subjective and interpretive language, such as \"vibrant,\" \"dynamic,\" \"lively,\" \"beauty,\" and \"harmony,\" which the instructions advise against. The description also lacks specific visual details. The fish are described generally as \"colorful,\" but the most prominent group is a large school of small, yellow fish. The coral formation itself is not described beyond its location. To improve, replace the subjective adjectives with objective descriptions of the scene. Add specific details, such as the \"sandy seabed,\" the \"greenish-brown, lumpy texture\" of the coral, and the \"large school of small, yellow fish.\" Finally, the concluding sentence should be more concise and objective, stating that the focus is on the overall marine environment rather than using interpretive terms like \"beauty\" and \"harmony.\"",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This underwater shot shows a sandy seabed under deep blue water, with light filtering down from the surface. A large, greenish-brown coral formation with a lumpy texture sits in the center. A large school of small, yellow fish swims in a dense group around and above the coral, while other fish are scattered throughout the water. The camera holds a wide, stationary view, focusing on the overall marine environment centered on the coral and the fish.",
