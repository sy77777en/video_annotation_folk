    "pre_caption": "The video is a neighborhood scenery shot, capturing a quiet residential street lined with houses. The focus is on the environment, highlighting the peaceful atmosphere and the charm of suburban life. The scene features well-maintained homes with neatly trimmed gardens, vibrant greenery, and a clear blue sky, creating a serene and inviting ambiance. The absence of a main subject emphasizes the overall setting, allowing viewers to appreciate the harmonious blend of architecture and nature.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption generally follows the instruction by focusing on the environment and noting the absence of a main subject, but it could be improved by including more specific visual details present in the video. The caption should mention the presence of a silver van parked on the left side, a beige two-story house with a sloped roof and a small front garden, a white garage, and a narrow paved street lined with greenery and utility poles. The colorful vertical banner with Japanese writing near the van is a notable feature that should be described. The description of the sky as \"clear blue\" is mostly accurate, but it should also note the presence of some clouds. The phrase \"peaceful atmosphere\" and \"charm of suburban life\" are somewhat subjective and should be replaced with more objective visual details. Remove the phrase \"serene and inviting ambiance\" as it is subjective and redundant. The improved caption should focus on the specific visual elements and avoid emotional or interpretive language.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a quiet residential street lined with houses, focusing on specific visual elements. On the left side, a silver van is parked near a colorful vertical banner with Japanese writing. A beige two-story house with a sloped roof and a small front garden is prominently featured, alongside a white garage. The narrow paved street is lined with greenery and utility poles. The sky is mostly clear blue with some clouds, providing a backdrop to the well-maintained homes and neatly trimmed gardens. The absence of a main subject allows viewers to appreciate the harmonious blend of architecture and nature.",
