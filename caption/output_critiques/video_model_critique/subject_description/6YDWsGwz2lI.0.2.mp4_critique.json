Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is excellent and adheres perfectly to the provided instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:** The description is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the scene as a cityscape featuring \"towering buildings lining a street\" and a \"prominent skyscraper in the background.\" The mention of the \"warm glow of streetlights\" and the \"symmetry of the architecture\" are precise observations from the video.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is complete. It captures the essence of the video, which is an atmospheric shot of urban architecture. It successfully conveys that the video's purpose is to establish a sense of place and scale rather than to focus on a particular person or object.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Scenery Shot Protocol:** The caption correctly identifies the video as a \"cityscape scenery shot\" and, as instructed, explains why there is no main subject: \"The focus is on the environment and atmosphere... The scene emphasizes the scale and grandeur of the urban landscape rather than a specific object.\"\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The description is a single, well-structured paragraph that is both concise and easy to understand.\n*   **Language and Tone:** It uses simple, natural English and avoids overly subjective or emotional adjectives. Terms like \"towering,\" \"prominent,\" and \"grandeur\" are used appropriately to describe the visual characteristics of the architecture.\n*   **Formatting:** The caption is a single paragraph with no introductory text or markdown, as required.\n*   **Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to apply the instructions to a scenery shot. It is accurate, complete, and follows all formatting and content guidelines flawlessly.",
