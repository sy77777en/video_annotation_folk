    "pre_caption": "The video features two young men engaged in a playful interaction with a large, colorful exercise ball. One man, wearing a light blue t-shirt and a red baseball cap, is positioned in the foreground, holding the ball close to his face, which is partially obscured. He has short, light brown hair and a light skin tone. The second man, standing slightly behind him, is wearing a dark t-shirt and is looking up with a smile, suggesting a lighthearted moment. The exercise ball is predominantly turquoise with a gradient of pink, and its round shape contrasts with the angular lines of the basketball hoop in the background. The scene captures a moment of fun and camaraderie between the two men as they interact with the ball.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains subjective language and unnecessary details that violate the instructions. The phrases \"engaged in a playful interaction,\" \"suggesting a lighthearted moment,\" and the entire final sentence, \"The scene captures a moment of fun and camaraderie between the two men as they interact with the ball,\" are interpretive and should be removed. The description of the ball's shape contrasting with the basketball hoop is an unnecessary artistic observation about a background element and should also be deleted. Additionally, the description of the action is slightly inaccurate; the phrase \"with the ball airborne and making contact with his face\" should be corrected to more accurately describe the sequence, noting that the ball deforms upon impact with the man's head before it becomes airborne. The description of the second man is limited to his hands and a smile, which is acceptable given his limited visibility in the video.",

A large, turquoise and pink exercise ball is shown deforming as it makes contact with the side of his head. The ball then bounces away and becomes airborne. To the left, the hands of a second man are visible. The outdoor setting includes a basketball hoop, trees, and a white truck in the background.",
