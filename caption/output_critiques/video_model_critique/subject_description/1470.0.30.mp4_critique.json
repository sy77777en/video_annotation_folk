    "pre_caption": "The video features a woman in a bathtub filled with foam, obscuring her body below the neck. Her head, positioned slightly to the right of center, occupies about one-third of the frame's height. She has a light skin tone and wears a pink towel wrapped around her head. Her eyes are covered with cucumber slices, and she has headphones on. In the first part, her expression is relaxed, but later, she appears surprised or startled, with her mouth open wide.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows a woman in a bathtub filled with foam, making her body below her head invisible beneath the foam. Her head occupies about one-third of the frame's height and is positioned to the right of the center.**\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is mostly accurate. It correctly identifies the subject as a woman in a foam-filled bathtub, her light skin tone, the pink towel, and the headphones. It also accurately captures the shift in her expression from relaxed to surprised. However, there is a key inaccuracy: the caption states her eyes are covered with cucumber slices in the first part and that she later appears surprised, but it fails to mention that the cucumber slices are *gone* when she looks surprised. The video clearly shows her with cucumbers on, and then without them as she reacts. This omission makes the sequence of events slightly misleading.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe description is reasonably complete but misses a few details.\n*   **Missing Action:** The most significant omission is the removal of the cucumber slices, which is a central part of the subject's transition.\n*   **Missing Detail:** While it mentions headphones, it omits their distinct orange color, which is a noticeable visual attribute.\n*   **Overly Technical Detail:** The detail \"Her head, positioned slightly to the right of center, occupies about one-third of the frame's height\" is very specific and technical. While not incorrect, it deviates from the \"simple, natural English\" instruction and feels more like a shot analysis than a general description.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is concise and generally clear.\n*   **Subject Description:** It correctly identifies the subject type (\"woman\") and describes her key visual attributes.\n*   **Combining Frames:** It successfully combines details from the beginning and end of the clip to describe a sequence.\n*   **Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids terms like \"image\" or \"frame\" (though \"frame's height\" is borderline).\n*   **Focus:** It correctly focuses on the salient subject and avoids unnecessary background details.\n*   **Describing Transitions:** This is the main area where the caption falls short. The instructions state to \"describe the subject in each segment separately, noting the type of transition... and explaining how the subjects change\" or \"describe the transition in detail\" if subjects are switching/revealing. The caption notes the change in expression but misses the physical change (cucumbers being removed) that accompanies it.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is good but not great. It successfully follows many of the core instructions but fails on the crucial point of accurately and completely describing the transition the subject undergoes. By omitting the removal of the cucumber slices, it misses a key action and creates a slightly inaccurate picture of the events. Simplifying the technical description of her head position would also improve its adherence to the \"simple, natural English\" rule.",
