    "pre_caption": "The video features a bold, text-based design with a focus on typography. The central text reads \"FREE EPISODE FROM MY HYPERLAPSE COURSE\" in uppercase, bold, red letters, followed by \"EQUIPMENT & SHOOTING\" in white, uppercase letters. The text is prominently displayed against a solid black background, creating a striking contrast that emphasizes the message. The layout is clean and straightforward, with the red text drawing immediate attention, while the white text provides additional context.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "**Feedback on the Caption:**\n\nThe provided caption is well-written, accurate for the most part, and adheres to many of the instructions. However, it could be improved in terms of completeness and precision.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is mostly accurate. It correctly identifies the text content, colors, case, and the bold style of the fonts.\n*   It misses a key detail about the second line of text, \"EQUIPMENT & SHOOTING,\" which is not just uppercase and white but also **italicized**.\n*   It also omits the specific design element of the first line, where the red letters are set within individual red rectangular blocks, which is a distinct visual feature.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The description is good but not fully complete. Adding the details about the italic font and the rectangular blocks behind the first line of text would create a more thorough and precise visual description.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The caption is clear, concise, and written in a single paragraph as requested.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It correctly identifies the subject as a \"text-based design\" and \"typography,\" which is appropriate for this type of content.\n*   **Visual Attributes:** It describes many visual attributes but, as noted, misses a few key ones.\n*   **Objectivity:** The caption uses terms like \"striking contrast\" and \"clean and straightforward.\" While these can be subjective, in this context, they function as acceptable descriptors of design principles and visual impact rather than emotional states, so they align with the instructions.\n*   **Formatting:** The caption correctly avoids markdown and introductory text.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is good but could be made excellent by incorporating the missing visual details for a more complete and precise description.\n\nHere is a revised version that incorporates this feedback:\n\n\"The video displays a text-based title card on a solid black background. The top line of text, 'FREE EPISODE FROM MY HYPERLAPSE COURSE,' is presented in a bold, uppercase, red font, with each letter set inside an individual red rectangular block. Below this, the text 'EQUIPMENT & SHOOTING' appears in a bold, italicized, uppercase white font. The high-contrast design and typographic hierarchy clearly present the information, with the red text serving as the primary title and the white text as a subtitle.\"",
