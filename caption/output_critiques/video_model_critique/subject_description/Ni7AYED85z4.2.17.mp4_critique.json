    "pre_caption": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot featuring a misty waterfront with historic buildings lining the opposite shore, their facades partially obscured by fog. The water in the foreground is a deep blue-green, gently rippling and bordered by a stone walkway that curves along the edge. The atmosphere is tranquil and slightly mysterious due to the haze, emphasizing the scale and ambiance of the urban landscape rather than focusing on any individual person or object. There is no main subject because the intent is to capture the overall mood and expanse of the cityscape, highlighting the interplay between architecture, water, and weather.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly identifies the video as a scenery shot without a main subject and consequently omits the most salient subject present. A woman is clearly visible on the right side of the frame for the entire duration of the video. The description should be revised to focus on her, as per the instruction: \"If the video features salient human or non-human subjects, focus your description on them.\" The last two sentences, which incorrectly justify the video as a scenery shot, should be deleted. The new description should begin with the woman, detailing her plaid coat, reddish-brown pants, and her pose as she looks out at the water. The description of the foggy cityscape, water, and buildings can be retained but should be mentioned after the primary subject.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A woman in a plaid coat and reddish-brown pants stands on a curved stone walkway, looking out over a wide expanse of water. She gazes at a foggy cityscape across the deep blue-green, rippling water. A line of historic buildings on the opposite shore is partially obscured by the thick mist, creating a tranquil and mysterious atmosphere. Two wooden posts stick out of the water near the walkway, and a construction crane is faintly visible through the fog on the far left.",
