    "pre_caption": "The video features a person with a distinctive appearance. The individual has medium-length, straight red hair and is wearing a white dress shirt paired with a blue and yellow striped tie. Their face is marked with unusual, exaggerated features, including a prominent, wide smile and large eyes, giving an artificial or mask-like impression. The person is standing upright, and their attire suggests a formal or school setting. The lower part of the video shows the person wearing dark pants, with their hands relaxed by their sides. The overall appearance is striking due to the combination of formal clothing and the unique facial characteristics.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains significant factual errors and omits a key visual transition. First, it incorrectly states that in the latter part of the video, \"the person is shown wearing dark pants, with their hands relaxed by their sides.\" The video is a close-up shot from the chest up, and the person's pants and hands are never visible. This sentence must be deleted. Second, the tie is described as \"blue and white striped,\" but it is clearly blue and gold or yellow. Most importantly, the caption completely fails to mention the most prominent action: the person's eyes roll back to become entirely white in a quick transition. This is a critical detail that must be included. Finally, the first and last sentences are redundant or subjective and should be removed for conciseness. The description should begin directly with the person's attributes and end after describing their appearance and actions.",
