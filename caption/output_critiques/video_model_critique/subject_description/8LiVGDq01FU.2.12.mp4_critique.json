    "pre_caption": "The video features a person wearing a space suit, characterized by a helmet and a dark, padded jacket with light-colored stripes. The suit includes gloves and pants that match the jacket's color scheme. The person is oriented with their back to the viewer, leaning slightly forward with arms extended, suggesting movement or interaction with something out of view. The setting appears to be a dimly lit, enclosed space with reflective surfaces, enhancing the futuristic and technical appearance of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on this caption. It is accurate, detailed, and adheres closely to all the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description of the subject as \"a person wearing a space suit\" is accurate.\n*   The details of the suit—\"helmet,\" \"dark, padded jacket with light-colored stripes,\" \"gloves and pants that match\"—are all correct and directly observable in the video.\n*   The description of the person's pose and orientation (\"back to the viewer, leaning slightly forward with arms extended\") is precise.\n*   The characterization of the setting as a \"dimly lit, enclosed space with reflective surfaces\" is also accurate.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully captures all the essential visual information. It describes the main subject in detail, including their attire and posture, which are the most salient features of the scene.\n*   It provides just enough context about the environment to ground the subject without shifting the focus away from them.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The caption is a well-balanced, single paragraph that is both brief and rich in detail.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** The primary focus is correctly placed on the person in the suit.\n*   **Objective Language:** The caption avoids subjective emotional adjectives. The phrase \"futuristic and technical appearance\" is an acceptable interpretation based on the visual evidence (a spacesuit in a complex, non-natural environment) and describes the scene's aesthetic rather than conveying an emotion.\n*   **Key Attributes:** You have successfully described the subject's type, clothing, pose, and orientation as instructed.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** The words \"image\" and \"frame\" are not used.\n*   **Background Description:** You correctly included a brief description of the background. In this case, it is justified because the environment is crucial for understanding the context of a person in a spacesuit.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe caption is excellent. It demonstrates a clear understanding of the instructions and applies them effectively to create a description that is clear, accurate, and comprehensive. No changes are needed.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A person in a space suit is shown from behind in a dimly lit, enclosed space. The suit consists of a white helmet, a dark padded jacket with white straps, and matching pants and gloves. They are leaning forward with their arms slightly extended, as if moving through the environment. The setting features reflective surfaces and stacked, horizontal structures that create a complex, futuristic, and technical atmosphere.",
