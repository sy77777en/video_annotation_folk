    "pre_caption": "The video features a man wearing a green and red cap with the words \"HUNGRY & FAMOUS\" on it. He has a mustache and is dressed in a white short-sleeved shirt, a dark green vest with yellow trim, and matching green pants. He also wears a tie and a watch on his left wrist. In the video, he is seen standing inside a train compartment, initially with his hands on his hips, and later leaning on the window frame with his arms resting on it. The setting suggests a train environment, with visible elements like a map and communication equipment in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption.\n\n**Feedback:**\n\nThe caption is a good attempt and follows several key instructions, but it has a significant factual error and some omissions that detract from its overall quality.\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The most critical issue is the description of the text on the man's cap. The caption states it reads \"HUNGRY & FAMOUS,\" which is incorrect. The text is not clearly legible in the video, and the instruction explicitly states, \"You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\" By inventing text, the caption violates this core rule and provides misinformation. A better approach would have been to describe the cap's colors and mention the presence of illegible text or an emblem. The rest of the description of his attire and features is accurate.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is incomplete in describing the man's actions. It summarizes his movement as going from \"hands on his hips\" to \"leaning on the window frame,\" but it completely omits the more specific and significant actions he takes: picking up and hanging up a handset, and then pulling down the sliding window. These actions are central to the short narrative of the clip. Additionally, it misses a noticeable detail of his outfit: the pocket watch chain hanging from his vest.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Strengths:** The caption successfully adheres to the one-paragraph format, uses simple and objective language, avoids subjective adjectives, and correctly identifies the subject type (\"man\"). It also correctly combines details from the whole video into a single description rather than a frame-by-frame account.\n    *   **Weaknesses:** As mentioned, it fails on the instruction to avoid speculation/inaccuracy. While the instruction says to avoid mentioning the background unless necessary, its inclusion here is acceptable as it provides useful context about the man's role (likely a train conductor). However, the failure to describe his key actions means it doesn't fully capture the \"motion\" or \"action\" aspect of the subject.\n\nIn summary, while the caption's structure and basic description are good, the major factual error regarding the hat's text and the omission of the subject's key actions make it a poor representation of the video content according to the provided guidelines.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A man with a mustache, wearing a green and red cap, a white short-sleeved shirt, and a dark green vest with yellow trim and a pocket watch chain, stands inside a train compartment. He also wears matching green pants, a dark tie, and a watch on his left wrist. He briefly picks up a black handset from a wall-mounted device before hanging it back up. He then pulls down a sliding window and leans forward, resting his arms on the window frame as he looks out.",
