    "pre_caption": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot capturing a quiet residential area. It features traditional Japanese houses with distinct blue-tiled roofs and wooden accents, surrounded by neatly trimmed greenery and small gardens. The scene is bathed in bright daylight, highlighting the clear blue sky and a few scattered clouds. The focus is on the harmonious blend of architecture and nature, creating a serene and picturesque atmosphere. There is no main subject as the emphasis is on the overall environment and the tranquil ambiance of the neighborhood.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is mostly accurate and follows the instruction well by focusing on the environment and architectural features, correctly identifying the absence of a main subject and emphasizing the scenery. However, the mention of \"the harmonious blend of architecture and nature, creating a serene and picturesque atmosphere\" introduces subjective language and emotional tone, which should be avoided. The caption should also mention the presence of a convex traffic mirror and utility poles, which are visually prominent and help define the residential setting. To improve, remove subjective phrases and add these missing elements for a more objective and complete description.",
