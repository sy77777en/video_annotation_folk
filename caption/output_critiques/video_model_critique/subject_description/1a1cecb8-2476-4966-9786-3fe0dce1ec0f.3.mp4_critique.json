    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows a street scene with a person with pink hair, glasses, and a black mask positioned on the far left of the frame. Only part of their upper body is visible, taking up about 10% of the frame's width.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is good. Here is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the instructions:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies a person with pink hair, glasses, and a black mask on the left side of the scene. The description of their partial visibility, forward-facing posture, and the surrounding environment (decorative railing, trees, purple blossoms) perfectly matches the visual information in the video.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is sufficiently complete. It focuses on the most prominent subject—the person—and provides their key visual attributes. It also includes essential details about the immediate setting, which gives context to the subject's location. While it could have mentioned the person's black top, the details provided are enough to form a clear mental image.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The caption successfully balances being concise with providing key information.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** It correctly identifies the \"person\" as the main subject and describes their attributes in detail, as instructed.\n*   **No Frame/Image References:** It correctly avoids terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Simple and Natural Language:** The language is clear, straightforward, and easy to understand.\n*   **Single Paragraph:** The description is formatted as a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids subjective adjectives, using descriptive terms like \"pink,\" \"black,\" and \"decorative.\"\n*   **Mentioning the Background:** The instructions state not to mention the background unless necessary. In this case, describing the railing and trees is justified as it provides essential context for the scene and the person's location on what appears to be a bridge or walkway. It helps to build a more complete picture without being overly detailed.\n*   **Prioritization:** The caption correctly prioritizes the main subject (the person) before briefly describing the background elements.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe caption is excellent. It is a well-written, accurate, and concise description that adheres closely to all the provided guidelines. It effectively captures the essential visual elements of the video in a clear and objective manner.",
