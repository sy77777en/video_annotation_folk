    "pre_caption": "The video captures a bustling urban scene at night, featuring a modern cityscape with illuminated skyscrapers and digital billboards. In the foreground, a walkway is visible with three people. A man in a dark suit and carrying a bag walks towards the camera, while another man in a similar suit walks away. A woman in a long, light-colored coat and wearing a mask walks to the right. The background showcases a busy street with several buses and cars, highlighting the vibrant city life. The overall atmosphere is lively, with the bright lights of the buildings contrasting against the night sky.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. This video likely focuses more on the landscape, with some subjects present but not the main focus. In such cases, it's best to briefly describe these subjects' types without going into too much detail. If the video features many subjects, but it's unclear which one is the main subject, please describe all the subjects collectively as a group.\n\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the setting as a modern, urban cityscape at night with illuminated skyscrapers and digital billboards. The description of the people in the foreground—a man in a suit walking towards the camera, another walking away, and a woman in a light-colored coat—is precise. The background description of a busy street with buses and cars is also correct.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is sufficiently complete for a concise summary. It focuses on the most salient subjects (the three main pedestrians and the overall cityscape) and effectively conveys the essence of the scene. While other pedestrians and details exist, the caption wisely prioritizes the key elements to maintain clarity and brevity.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption follows most of the instructions well, but there is one significant deviation.\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   It is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English.\n    *   It avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   It correctly identifies subject types (\"man,\" \"woman,\" \"buses,\" \"cars\").\n    *   It describes key visual attributes (clothing, direction of movement).\n    *   It successfully distinguishes between multiple subjects of the same type (e.g., \"a man... walks towards the camera, while another man... walks away\").\n    *   The structure is logical, starting with the overall scene and then focusing on the foreground subjects.\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The primary issue is the violation of the rule: \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption uses \"bustling,\" \"vibrant,\" and \"lively.\" These words describe an atmosphere and are interpretive rather than purely objective visual descriptions. A more compliant caption would describe the visual facts that *create* this impression (e.g., \"many people are walking,\" \"the street is filled with moving vehicles\") instead of using these summary adjectives.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe caption is excellent in terms of accuracy and general structure. Its only flaw is the use of subjective adjectives, which goes against a specific negative constraint in the instructions. To be fully compliant, these words should be replaced with more objective, descriptive language.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video shows an urban scene at night, featuring a modern cityscape with illuminated skyscrapers and digital billboards. In the foreground, people walk along an elevated walkway. A man in a dark suit carrying a bag walks towards the camera, while another man in a similar suit walks away. A woman in a long, light-colored coat and wearing a mask walks to the right. The background shows a street below with several buses, cars, and pedestrians. The bright lights of the buildings and signs contrast against the dark night sky.",
