    "pre_caption": "This video presents a garden scenery shot, capturing a tranquil, private outdoor space. A path of dark, rectangular stepping stones leads from a smooth, light-colored patio across a sandy area towards a backdrop of dense, green tropical foliage, where a prominent, dark-barked tree stands. In the foreground, a round, dark-colored table with a glass top rests on the patio. There is no main subject in the video, as the focus is on conveying the serene and secluded atmosphere of the tropical environment. The camera's movement serves to reveal the layout and features of the space rather than to follow a specific person or object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption begins with the introductory phrase \"This video presents,\" which should be removed. The words \"tranquil\" and \"serene\" are subjective adjectives that convey emotion and should be deleted to adhere to the instructions. The description is also missing a detail: a small, white, squarish box resting on the glass tabletop. Finally, the last two sentences (\"There is no main subject... person or object.\") are overly explanatory and should be removed. The description of the scene itself is sufficient to establish that it is a scenery shot focused on the environment, making this explicit analysis redundant and verbose.",
