    "pre_caption": "The video features two main subjects. The first is a large, humanoid figure with a dark, shadowy appearance, glowing blue eyes, and a fragmented, block-like structure. This figure has an imposing presence and appears to be constructed from angular, black shapes. The second subject is a smaller, fox-like creature with orange fur and a bushy tail, wearing a green tunic. This creature is positioned near the larger figure, highlighting a stark contrast in size and form. Both subjects exhibit a stylized, animated design, contributing to their atypical and striking appearances.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Clearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nKeep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Only mention the background or motion if necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. Avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. Use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. Avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Return only the description.\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption omits the primary action of the video, which is the two subjects engaged in combat. It fails to mention that the large figure assembles itself from a pile of rocks at the start of the video and that both subjects are wielding and using swords to fight each other. The description of the large figure's color as \"brown-green\" is inaccurate; it is more of a dark grey, stone-like color. Additionally, the caption uses subjective phrases like \"imposing presence\" and \"striking appearances,\" which should be avoided. To improve, the caption should describe the combat, including the large figure assembling itself and both subjects attacking and dodging with their respective swords. The color of the large figure should be corrected to dark grey stone, and the subjective phrases should be removed.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a video game with an isometric perspective, a combat sequence unfolds in a grassy, ruined area with blue tiled floors. A large figure, identified as \"Garden Knight,\" initially appears as a pile of dark grey, stone-like blocks before assembling itself into a humanoid form with glowing, multi-colored eyes. Wielding a large sword, it attacks with sweeping orange energy slashes. Its opponent is a small, orange, fox-like creature in a green tunic, which dodges the attacks and retaliates with its own smaller sword, creating a bright flash of light upon hitting the knight. The user interface, showing health bars and other game information, is visible on the screen.",
