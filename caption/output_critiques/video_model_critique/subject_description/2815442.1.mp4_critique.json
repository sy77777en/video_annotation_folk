Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly states there is an \"absence of a specific main subject\" and omits the presence of several small boats and jet skis that move across the water throughout the video. These moving watercraft are salient subjects that should be described. Additionally, the caption uses subjective adjectives such as \"serene,\" \"lush,\" \"tranquil,\" \"natural beauty,\" \"harmony,\" and \"peacefulness,\" which are explicitly forbidden by the instructions. The description should be revised to be a single, objective paragraph that describes the landscape and includes the boats as subjects.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is a wide, high-angle, time-lapse aerial shot of a large body of water surrounded by tree-covered hills under a blue sky with scattered clouds. A forested peninsula with some buildings extends into the water from the left. Throughout the video, several small, white watercraft, including boats and jet skis, travel across the water's surface, creating visible wakes. On the right side of the frame, a shoreline with several docked boats is also visible.",
