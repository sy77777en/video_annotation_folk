    "pre_caption": "The video features a man wearing a brown hat, sunglasses, and a brown jacket. He has a goatee and is holding a silver object close to his face, appearing to speak into it. The man is positioned prominently in the foreground, facing slightly to the side. In the latter part of the video, he is seen from behind, walking away down a tree-lined street. The setting suggests an urban environment with buildings and greenery visible.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is a perfect example of what was requested.\n\n**Accuracy:** The description is entirely accurate. It correctly identifies the man, his attire (brown hat, sunglasses, brown jacket), his goatee, the silver object he holds, and his actions. The description of the scene changing to show him from behind walking away is also spot-on.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is very complete. It captures all the key visual information from the short clip, including the subject's appearance, the object he interacts with, the change in camera angle/action, and the general setting. It successfully synthesizes the entire video into one cohesive description.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows all instructions flawlessly:\n*   **Format:** It is a single, well-structured paragraph without any introductory text or markdown.\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The language is simple, clear, and direct.\n*   **Subject Focus:** It focuses on the main subject (the man) and describes his attributes in detail as requested.\n*   **Objectivity:** It uses objective, descriptive language (\"silver object,\" \"brown jacket\") and avoids subjective or emotional terms.\n*   **Handling Transitions:** It perfectly describes the change in the video (\"In the latter part of the video, he is seen from behind...\") without using forbidden words like \"frame\" or \"shot.\"\n*   **Contextual Background:** It mentions the background (\"tree-lined street,\" \"urban environment\") appropriately to provide context without overwhelming the description of the subject.\n\nIn summary, the caption is excellent. It is accurate, comprehensive, and adheres strictly to all the provided guidelines.",
