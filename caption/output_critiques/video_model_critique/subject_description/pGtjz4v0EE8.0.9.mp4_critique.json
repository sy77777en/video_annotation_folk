    "pre_caption": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot capturing a vibrant waterfront scene. The focus is on the expansive view of a historic city with a prominent bell tower rising above a cluster of ornate, classical buildings. The architecture is characterized by its intricate facades and domed roofs, reflecting a rich cultural heritage. The foreground features a bustling waterway with various boats and water taxis creating dynamic movement across the shimmering blue water. The absence of a main subject emphasizes the grandeur and atmosphere of the cityscape, highlighting the harmonious blend of architecture and natural elements.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is mostly accurate but contains an interpretive phrase that should be removed. The phrase \"reflecting a rich cultural heritage\" is an inference about the history of the architecture, not a direct visual description of what is seen in the video. According to the instructions, you must avoid describing what is not visible. Removing this phrase would make the caption fully compliant without losing essential information, as the architectural style is already described as \"ornate\" and \"classical.\" The rest of the caption correctly identifies the scene as a cityscape, describes the key elements like the bell tower, buildings, and boats on the water, and appropriately explains the lack of a single main subject as per the instructions for scenery shots.",
