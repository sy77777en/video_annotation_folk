    "pre_caption": "The video features a large white bird, likely an egret, with a long neck and slender legs. Its plumage is smooth and bright, contrasting with its dark legs and pointed yellow beak. The bird is positioned near the edge of a body of water, partially reflected in the surface. It appears to be foraging or observing its surroundings, with its neck extended forward in a focused manner. The setting includes grassy vegetation and a muddy bank, indicating a natural habitat.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on this caption. It is accurate, detailed, and adheres closely to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subject as a \"large white bird, likely an egret\" and precisely describes its key features: \"long neck,\" \"slender legs,\" \"smooth and bright\" plumage, \"dark legs,\" and \"pointed yellow beak.\"\n*   The description of its posture and action (\"neck extended forward in a focused manner,\" \"appears to be foraging\") is a correct interpretation of the visual evidence.\n*   The mention of the reflection in the water is also accurate.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The description is very complete, capturing all the essential visual information about the subject. It details the bird's species, physical attributes, posture, and location.\n*   Including the context of the \"natural habitat\" with its \"grassy vegetation and a muddy bank\" adds valuable information about the scene without being overly descriptive of the background.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is a single, coherent paragraph that is both concise and easy to understand.\n*   **Subject Focus:** It successfully focuses on the most salient subject (the bird) and provides a detailed description as required.\n*   **Objectivity:** The language is descriptive and objective, avoiding emotional or overly subjective terms. \"Focused manner\" is an acceptable description of the bird's intent posture.\n*   **Precise Language:** The use of terms like \"egret,\" \"plumage,\" and \"foraging\" demonstrates excellent adherence to the instruction for precision.\n*   **Handling of Background:** The caption correctly follows the guideline to only mention the background when it provides necessary context. Describing the bank and vegetation helps establish the setting for the bird's foraging behavior.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe caption is excellent. It perfectly balances detail with conciseness, providing a clear and accurate picture of the video's content while strictly following all the given rules. No improvements are necessary.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A large, white egret with a long neck, slender dark legs, and a pointed yellow beak wades in the shallows at the edge of a body of water. Its smooth, bright plumage is reflected on the murky surface as it extends its neck forward, intently scanning for prey. The scene is set along a muddy, grassy bank, typical of its natural habitat.",
