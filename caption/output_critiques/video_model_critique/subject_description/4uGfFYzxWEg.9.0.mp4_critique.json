    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on this caption. It is a well-written and accurate description that adheres closely to the provided guidelines.\n\n### Feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the main subject as a bar chart (specifically, a histogram representing a data distribution) and accurately describes its key components: the black bars, the labeled axes, the title, and the significant red vertical line. It also correctly interprets the context provided by the surrounding text, noting that it relates to a statistical analysis of coughs in a quiz show scenario.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is very complete. It captures all the salient information presented in the static video. By including details about the chart's title and the content of the surrounding text, the caption provides a comprehensive understanding of what is being displayed, moving beyond a purely visual description to include the essential context.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption perfectly follows all instructions.\n*   It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   It uses precise subject types (\"bar chart,\" \"text\").\n*   It describes key visual attributes (color, labels, title, red line) in detail.\n*   It avoids subjective language and forbidden terms like \"image.\"\n*   It correctly prioritizes the main visual element (the chart) before describing the secondary element (the text).\n\nThis is an exemplary caption that effectively summarizes the content of the video. No improvements are needed.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A static shot of a document features a black histogram titled \"Simulations assuming half of all coughs are Whittock.\" The y-axis is labeled \"Number of simulations,\" ranging from 0 to 1000, and the x-axis is labeled \"Coughs during 42 x 5-second-periods after correct answers,\" ranging from 0 to 30. The data forms a bell-shaped curve, peaking around 12 coughs. A red vertical line is drawn at the 19-cough mark on the x-axis. Text above and below the chart explains that under this scenario, the probability of getting at least 19 coughs in 42 trials is 7.82%. A banner at the bottom cites \"Liam Shaw - A Statistical Analysis of Coughing Patterns on 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?' (2020).\"",
