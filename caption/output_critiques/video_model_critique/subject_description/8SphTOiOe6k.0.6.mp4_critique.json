    "pre_caption": "This video presents a streetscape scenery shot of a quiet Japanese town on a bright, sunny day. There is no single main subject, as the camera's slow pan is designed to capture the overall atmosphere and environment of the location rather than focusing on a particular person or object. The scene is characterized by traditional Japanese architecture, with buildings featuring dark tiled roofs and wooden facades, one of which has a prominent red awning on its upper floor. A few pedestrians stroll along the sidewalk, and a white van is parked near a small outdoor seating area. In the background, green mountains rise against a brilliant blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds, enhancing the tranquil and picturesque quality of the townscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly uses several subjective adjectives and an interpretive phrase, which violates the instruction to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" Specifically, the words \"brilliant,\" \"fluffy,\" \"tranquil,\" and \"picturesque\" should be removed. The concluding phrase, \"enhancing the tranquil and picturesque quality of the townscape,\" is also subjective and should be deleted. Additionally, the explanation for why there is no main subject is slightly verbose. While the caption mentions \"pedestrians,\" it could be more specific by noting the two women walking on the right sidewalk. To improve, remove the subjective language, shorten the explanation for the scenery shot, and add a brief, neutral detail about the most visible pedestrians. For example, the last sentence could be revised to: \"In the background, green mountains are visible against a blue sky with white clouds.\"",
