    "pre_caption": "The video features a woman with medium-length dark hair and a light skin tone, wearing a dark-colored top with intricate gold embroidery. She is seated at a table, holding chopsticks and eating from a plate of food that includes colorful vegetables. Her expression is attentive and engaged as she looks slightly to the side. In front of her, there is a glass of amber-colored liquid and a small bowl, suggesting a dining setting. The scene conveys a moment of dining and conversation.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Your feedback on the caption is as follows:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is largely accurate. The woman's hair, skin tone, and the details of her embroidered top are correctly described. The objects on the table, such as the glass and bowl, are also accurately noted. However, her action is more clearly speaking than eating at this specific moment, although she is in the process of a meal.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is incomplete. It fails to mention a significant part of the woman's attire: the maroon vest she is wearing over her dark top. Additionally, it omits the presence of other people at the table, whose shoulders and arms are visible on the far left and right of the scene, which would provide better context for the interaction.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption fails to adhere to a key instruction.\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid subjective adjectives\":** The caption uses the words \"attentive and engaged\" to describe the woman's expression. These are subjective terms that convey emotion and interpretation, which the instructions explicitly forbid.\n*   **Incomplete Subject Description:** While it describes the main subject, it misses key visual attributes (the vest) and fails to mention the secondary, partially-visible subjects as instructed.\n*   **Interpretive Language:** The final sentence, \"The scene conveys a moment of dining and conversation,\" is an interpretation of the scene's mood and context rather than a direct description of visual facts. While \"dining\" is evident, \"conversation\" is an inference based on her expression. A more direct description would be to state that her mouth is open as if speaking.\n\nIn summary, the caption correctly identifies the main subject and some visual details but is weakened by its use of subjective, emotional language, which violates a core rule. It is also incomplete, as it omits a prominent piece of clothing and the presence of other people in the scene.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a dimly lit dining room, an East Asian woman with medium-length dark hair and bangs sits at a table with a white tablecloth. She wears a black top with a gold geometric pattern at the collar, layered under a maroon vest. She holds chopsticks in her right hand over a plate of food. Her mouth is open, and she looks toward the right side of the frame. On the table in front of her are several dishes, a small white bowl, and a tall glass with an amber-colored liquid and ice. The shoulder of another person in a similar maroon vest is visible on the left, and the arm of a person in a white shirt is visible on the right.",
