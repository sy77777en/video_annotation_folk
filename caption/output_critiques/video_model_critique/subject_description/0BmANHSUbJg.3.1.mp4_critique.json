    "pre_caption": "The video features a large passenger airplane with a white fuselage and visible windows, positioned prominently in the foreground. The aircraft is partially engulfed in a fiery explosion, with bright orange flames and thick black smoke emanating from its wing. The explosion creates a dramatic contrast against the night setting, with the flames illuminating the scene. In the background, a hangar with bright lights is visible, providing a stark contrast to the dark sky. The sequence captures the intensity of the explosion and the subsequent smoke, highlighting the dramatic impact on the airplane.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.\n\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.",

  "generated_critique": "Your feedback on the caption is as follows:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the main subject as a large passenger airplane and accurately describes its key attributes (white fuselage, visible windows) and location (foreground). The description of the event—a fiery explosion with orange flames and black smoke emanating from the wing—is also precise.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is reasonably complete. It covers the most salient subjects and actions: the airplane, the explosion, the smoke, and the background hangar. It successfully describes the progression from fire to smoke, which is a key part of the short video. It correctly omits the very indistinct silhouette on the left, adhering to the rule of not describing what is uncertain.\n\n**Adherence to the Given Instruction:** The caption fails to adhere to several key instructions:\n\n1.  **Avoid Subjective Adjectives:** The instructions state, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption uses words like \"dramatic\" (\"dramatic contrast,\" \"dramatic impact\") and \"stark\" (\"stark contrast\"). These words describe the emotional or artistic effect of the scene rather than its objective visual properties.\n2.  **Describe Subjects, Not the Video's Effect:** The final sentence, \"The sequence captures the intensity of the explosion and the subsequent smoke, highlighting the dramatic impact on the airplane,\" violates the core principle of describing only the visible subjects. It analyzes what the \"sequence captures\" and what it is \"highlighting,\" which is an interpretation of the filmmaker's intent and the video's effect on the viewer, not a description of the content itself. The word \"intensity\" is also subjective.\n3.  **Avoid Meta-Language:** The use of the word \"sequence\" refers to the video as a medium, which is similar to the forbidden terms \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n\nIn summary, while the caption accurately identifies the subjects and events, it deviates from the instructions by including subjective analysis and interpretive language about the video's impact and composition, rather than sticking to a purely objective description of the visual information.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "At night, a large passenger airplane with a white fuselage and visible windows is positioned in the foreground. An explosion erupts on its wing, creating a large fireball of orange flames that illuminates the scene. The flames are then replaced by a plume of thick, dark smoke. In the background, a large hangar is lit by several bright lights.",
