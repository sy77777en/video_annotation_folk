    "pre_caption": "A single subject is shown from the shoulders up, seated in a vehicle and wearing a light-colored collared shirt. The subject's appearance undergoes several transformations. It appears as a young boy with short, straight blond hair. The face then morphs into a bald, pale-skinned creature with pointed ears, wide eyes, and a large, toothy grin. Following this, it changes into a reptilian-like being with reddish-brown, wrinkled skin, dark, narrow eyes, and a snout. Finally, the subject appears as a young man with wavy, medium-length blond hair.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows a human driving a car, with the frame capturing from his shoulders to his head. Throughout the video, his face transforms, shifting between a human, a child, and non-human appearances.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies that a single subject is shown and that this subject undergoes a series of transformations. The description of each stage—the young boy, the bald creature, the reptilian being, and the young man—precisely matches the visual details and the sequence shown in the video.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is very complete. It captures all the essential transformations and provides sufficient detail for each appearance (hair, skin texture, facial features) to create a clear mental image. It also correctly notes the constant elements, such as the subject being seated in a vehicle and wearing the same shirt, which provides important context for the transformations.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres perfectly to the given instructions.\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** It is a single, well-structured paragraph that is both concise and informative.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** It focuses entirely on the subject and its changing attributes, avoiding unnecessary details about the background.\n*   **Objective Language:** It uses descriptive, objective language (e.g., \"bald, pale-skinned creature,\" \"large, toothy grin\") and avoids subjective emotional terms.\n*   **Proper Terminology:** It correctly uses terms like \"boy\" and \"man\" and makes a good judgment call with \"creature\" and \"reptilian-like being\" for the non-human forms.\n*   **Transition Description:** It effectively describes the process of change using words like \"morphs\" and \"changes,\" fulfilling the requirement to detail transitions.\n*   **Formatting:** It is presented as a single paragraph without any introductory text or markdown.\n\nOverall, the caption is excellent. It is a model example of how to follow the instructions to produce a description that is accurate, detailed, and objective.",
