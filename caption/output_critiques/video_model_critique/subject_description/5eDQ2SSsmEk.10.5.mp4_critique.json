    "pre_caption": "This video presents a futuristic cityscape scenery shot, looking down from a high angle into a dark, narrow chasm between immense, imposing structures. Bright spotlights and glowing red and yellow lights pierce through a dense, particle-filled atmosphere, possibly rain or snow, illuminating the wet, metallic surfaces and complex industrial architecture below, which includes visible pipes and scaffolding. There is no main subject, as the shot emphasizes the overwhelming scale and oppressive, moody atmosphere of the environment. The focus is on creating a sense of place and feeling rather than following a specific character or object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

    "initial_feedback": "The focus is solely on a single  structures, not the narrow chasm.  It can be determined that the light is piercing through rain, not the atmosphere or snow. The frame takes this building as the main subject, and uses it as the core to create the environment.",

The building serves as the main subject of the frame, acting as the focal point around which the environment is constructed.",

The high-angle shot captures the building as the central subject, around which the environment is constructed. Bright spotlights and glowing red and yellow lights pierce through the rain, illuminating the wet, metallic surfaces and complex industrial architecture, including visible pipes and scaffolding. The scene emphasizes the overwhelming scale and moody atmosphere, creating a strong sense of place and feeling.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly uses subjective and interpretive language, which violates the instruction to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The final sentence, \"The scene emphasizes the overwhelming scale and moody atmosphere, creating a strong sense of place and feeling,\" should be removed entirely as words like \"overwhelming,\" \"moody,\" and \"strong sense of place\" are subjective. Additionally, the term \"cityscape\" is an assumption, as only a single structure and its immediate surroundings are visible; it should be replaced with a more accurate description like \"a large, futuristic structure.\" The phrase \"around which the environment is constructed\" is also interpretive and should be omitted in favor of a more direct description of what is seen. The caption should focus only on the objective visual elements: the high-angle view of a large, dark, metallic structure with industrial features like pipes and scaffolding, illuminated by white, red, and yellow lights amidst what appears to be heavy rain.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video shows a high-angle view looking down into a dark, narrow space between large, futuristic-style structures. The atmosphere is filled with dense, falling particles, resembling heavy rain or snow, which are illuminated by several light sources. Bright white spotlights, along with smaller red and yellow lights, cut through the darkness, reflecting off wet, metallic surfaces. The structures feature industrial elements, including visible pipes and scaffolding.",
