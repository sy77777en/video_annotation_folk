    "pre_caption": "This video captures a cityscape scenery shot from a static, symmetrical viewpoint within the light-blue steel truss structure of a bridge. A subway train with illuminated headlights travels towards the camera on tracks that run down the center of the frame, while a car is partially visible on a roadway to the left. The intricate, riveted beams of the bridge, one of which is marked with black graffiti, create a powerful sense of depth and industrial geometry, complemented by the pink railings lining the walkways on either side. The focus is on the grand scale and atmosphere of the urban infrastructure rather than a specific subject; the approaching train is an integral part of the environment, emphasizing the bridge's function and the city's constant motion.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the video as a scenery shot and describes its key components, including the bridge structure, train, cars, and railings. However, it includes subjective and interpretive language, such as \"intricate,\" \"powerful sense of depth,\" \"grand scale,\" and \"complemented by,\" which should be avoided. The final sentence, \"emphasizing the bridge's function and the city's constant motion,\" is an interpretation of the scene's meaning rather than a direct visual description. The explanation for why it is a scenery shot should be more concise and objective, simply stating that the focus is on the scale of the urban infrastructure rather than a single subject.",
