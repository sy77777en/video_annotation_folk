    "pre_caption": "The video features a white rally car driving at high speed on a dirt road, creating a large cloud of dust and smoke behind it. The car is sleek and aerodynamic, with visible racing decals and a spoiler. It navigates a winding path, suggesting dynamic movement and precision driving. The surrounding landscape is arid, with sparse vegetation and distant hills, emphasizing the car's motion and the dust trail it leaves. The scene captures the essence of a high-energy rally race in a desert-like environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is a good attempt but fails to fully adhere to several key instructions, particularly regarding objectivity, accuracy, and avoiding interpretation.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **Good:** The caption correctly identifies the main subject as a \"white rally car\" and its primary action of \"driving at high speed\" and \"creating a large cloud of dust and smoke.\" It also accurately describes the \"arid\" landscape with \"sparse vegetation and distant hills.\"\n*   **Needs Improvement:** The description of the car having \"visible racing decals\" is not verifiable due to the motion blur and the smoke obscuring the vehicle; the instructions state to avoid describing what you are unsure about. The road appears to be paved, not a \"dirt road,\" although it is covered in dust and sand.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   **Good:** The caption captures the most essential elements: the car, its action, the smoke, and the setting.\n*   **Needs Improvement:** It misses a few specific visual attributes of the car that are visible, such as the boxy shape and the prominent scoop on the roof.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violation of Objectivity:** The caption uses subjective and interpretive language, which is explicitly forbidden.\n    *   The word \"sleek\" is a subjective adjective. The car's design is more boxy and functional than sleek.\n    *   The phrase \"suggesting dynamic movement and precision driving\" is an interpretation of the driver's skill, not a direct description of the visible action.\n    *   The final sentence, \"The scene captures the essence of a high-energy rally race in a desert-like environment,\" is entirely interpretive. It describes a feeling (\"high-energy\") and an \"essence\" rather than observable facts.\n*   **Violation of \"Describe, Don't Analyze\":** The phrase \"emphasizing the car's motion and the dust trail it leaves\" analyzes the shot's composition rather than simply describing the scene's components.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption successfully identifies the subject and setting but includes subjective adjectives, interpretations, and unverifiable details, which directly contradict the instructions. To improve, the caption should be rewritten to be strictly descriptive and objective, focusing only on what is clearly visible.\n\n**Example of a more compliant caption:**\n\nFrom a high-angle, rear-facing perspective, a white, modified rally-style car speeds along a winding, paved road in an arid landscape. The car has a boxy shape, a spoiler, and a scoop on its roof. As it drifts around a turn, it generates a thick, massive cloud of white smoke that obscures its rear end.",
