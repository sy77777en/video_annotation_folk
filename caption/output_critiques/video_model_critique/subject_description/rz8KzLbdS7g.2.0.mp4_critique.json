The focus is on the environment, showcasing a blend of architectural styles with wooden and tiled structures, neatly trimmed greenery, and a clear blue sky. The absence of a main subject emphasizes the atmosphere and scale of the neighborhood, highlighting the peaceful and orderly setting rather than any specific object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately describes the video as a neighborhood scenery shot and correctly notes the absence of a main subject, focusing on the environment and architectural styles. However, it could be improved by mentioning the presence of specific visible elements such as a black car parked in front of a house, a white van and another car inside an open garage, a distinctively pruned tree, and blue recycling bins along the street. These details are visually salient and help further characterize the scene without shifting focus from the environment. The caption should also specify that the houses feature both wooden siding and tiled roofs, and that the greenery includes neatly trimmed bushes and a shaped tree, which are visually prominent. Including these elements would make the description more precise and informative while remaining concise and in line with the instruction.",

The scene highlights the environment, featuring a black car parked in front of a house, a white van and another car inside an open garage, and blue recycling bins lining the street. The greenery includes neatly trimmed bushes and a distinctively pruned tree, all under a clear blue sky. The absence of a main subject emphasizes the peaceful and orderly atmosphere, focusing on the architectural styles and the serene setting.",
