    "pre_caption": "The video features two women seated at a table in a dining setting. The first woman, wearing a maroon vest over a white shirt with a black bow tie, has medium skin tone and short, dark hair. She appears to be a server, indicated by a name tag on her vest, and is positioned centrally, looking forward with a neutral expression. In front of her is a plate of food and a glass of lemonade. The second woman, with a lighter skin tone and shoulder-length dark hair, is dressed in a dark outfit with gold embroidery. She is holding chopsticks and appears to be eating from a plate of food. Her expression is attentive, and she is oriented slightly to the side. The transition between the subjects occurs as the focus shifts from the first woman to the second, highlighting their interaction with the meal.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **switching from one to another**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the transition occurs, whether through subject movement or camera movement.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "This caption is not good for the video. It is highly inaccurate and describes subjects and events that are not present in the footage.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is almost entirely inaccurate. It describes two women, one of whom is a server in a vest and bow tie, and the other in a dark outfit with gold embroidery.\n*   The video actually shows a blurry shot of a woman with dark hair in a yellow top on the left and a man in a maroon shirt on the right, both seated at a table.\n*   There is no server, no vest, no bow tie, no name tag, and no gold embroidery visible.\n*   The caption mentions a \"focus shift\" and a transition between subjects, but the video is a single, short, blurry shot with erratic camera movement. No such transition occurs.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is not complete as it fails to describe the actual subjects present in the video. It omits the woman in the yellow top and the man in the maroon shirt, instead describing fictional characters.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violation:** The caption severely violates the instruction: \"You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\" It invents details about clothing (vest, bow tie, gold embroidery), roles (server), and camera work (focus shift) that are not in the video.\n*   **Violation:** It fails to \"Clearly identify each subject’s type\" and \"describe its key visual attributes in detail\" correctly, as the descriptions do not match the visual evidence.\n*   **Violation:** It incorrectly describes a shot transition that does not exist.\n*   **Partial Violation:** It uses the subjective adjective \"attentive,\" which the instructions advise against.\n\nIn summary, the caption seems to be for a completely different video. It fails on the most fundamental level of accurately describing the visual content provided.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A very short, blurry, and shaky point-of-view shot captures a scene in what appears to be a dimly lit restaurant. Seated at a white-clothed table are a woman and a man, both out of focus due to the rapid camera movement. The woman on the left has dark, shoulder-length hair and wears a yellow top. The man on the right wears a maroon shirt and is seen holding chopsticks. In the foreground, a plate of food and a tall glass containing an amber-colored drink are visible on the table. The camera pans quickly from left to right, creating significant motion blur.",
