    "pre_caption": "The video features a sleek, black vehicle with a glossy finish, prominently displaying advanced technology on its roof. The roof is equipped with two distinct cylindrical devices: one is a taller, slender cylinder, and the other is a shorter, dome-shaped structure. These devices are likely sensors or communication equipment. The vehicle is shown on a road, and a translucent blue circular wave emanates from the roof, suggesting the activation of a radar or sensor system. The vehicle's design is modern, with smooth lines and a streamlined shape, emphasizing its technological sophistication.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is mostly accurate in its description of the primary subject. It correctly identifies a black vehicle with a glossy finish and notes the presence of equipment on its roof. The description of a \"translucent blue circular wave\" is also accurate. However, there is a significant inaccuracy: the caption states the roof is equipped with \"two distinct cylindrical devices: one is a taller, slender cylinder, and the other is a shorter, dome-shaped structure.\" The video clearly shows there are *multiple* of each type of device—at least two tall antennas and two dome-shaped structures are visible as the camera pulls back.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is incomplete because it fails to account for all the subjects visible on the vehicle's roof. By mentioning only one of each type of device, it misrepresents the total amount of equipment shown. A complete description would acknowledge the presence of several antennas and dome-shaped devices.\n\n**Adherence to the Given Instruction:**\nThe caption deviates from several key instructions:\n\n*   **Avoid Speculation and Interpretation:** The caption includes multiple instances of interpretation rather than sticking to objective visual description. Phrases like \"likely sensors or communication equipment,\" \"suggesting the activation of a radar or sensor system,\" and \"emphasizing its technological sophistication\" are all assumptions about the function or purpose of the objects, which the instructions explicitly forbid (\"avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about\").\n*   **Avoid Subjective Adjectives:** The use of words like \"sleek,\" \"modern,\" and the phrase \"technological sophistication\" are subjective and convey an opinion or feeling about the vehicle, which goes against the instruction to avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\n*   **Focus on Visual Attributes:** While the caption describes some visual attributes, it spends too much time on interpretation. For example, instead of saying the wave \"suggest[s] the activation of a radar,\" it should simply describe the visual effect: \"a translucent blue circular wave emanates from the antenna.\"\n\nIn summary, the caption correctly identifies the main subject but is inaccurate and incomplete regarding the number of devices on the roof. Furthermore, it violates the core instructions by including significant speculation, interpretation, and subjective language instead of focusing strictly on objective visual details.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From an overhead perspective, the video shows the glossy black roof of a vehicle. The roof is fitted with several pieces of black equipment, including two tall, slender antennas and two dome-shaped devices mounted on square bases. A translucent, light-blue circular wave graphic radiates outward from the top of one of the antennas. As the camera pulls away, the vehicle is seen driving on a road marked with white lines.",
