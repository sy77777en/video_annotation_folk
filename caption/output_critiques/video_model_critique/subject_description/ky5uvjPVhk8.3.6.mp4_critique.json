    "pre_caption": "The video captures a serene garden scenery, focusing on the tranquil environment and lush greenery. A gentle stream flows over small stone steps, creating a soothing cascade, while vibrant autumn foliage in shades of red and green frames the scene. The stone and wooden structures blend harmoniously with the natural surroundings, enhancing the peaceful atmosphere. The focus is on the overall ambiance and the harmonious blend of natural and architectural elements, rather than any specific object, highlighting the beauty and tranquility of the setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption omits the presence of two people visible in the latter part of the video: a man in a white jacket and dark pants, and a woman in a tan coat and dark pants, both standing on a path near the garden. The caption should be revised to mention these human subjects, briefly describing their appearance and location, as required by the instruction to identify and describe all salient subjects. Additionally, the caption could be more concise by removing some redundancy about the ambiance and focus more on the visual details of the garden, stream, stone steps, autumn trees, and the wooden and stone structures. The revised caption should clearly state that the main focus is the garden scenery but also acknowledge the presence of the two people to fully meet the instruction requirements.",
