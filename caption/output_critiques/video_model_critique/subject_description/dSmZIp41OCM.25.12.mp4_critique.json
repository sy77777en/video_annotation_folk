    "pre_caption": "A cartoon character with a round, orange, pumpkin-like head featuring a simple smiling face is shown in a grassy area. The character is clad in a long, hooded, purple-grey cloak that covers its entire body, with only its thin, brown, stick-like legs visible. In the center of the scene is a stone well with a wooden frame, surrounded by a circular, brown-tiled path. Nearby, a small garden plot, enclosed by a white picket fence and a stone border, contains a single red, rose-like plant.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately describes the subjects and their visual attributes but omits the primary action that occurs in the video. It portrays a static scene, whereas the video shows the character moving. The description should be revised to include the character's movement from the well to the garden plot, as this action is the main event of the clip. For instance, you could state that the character \"runs from a central stone well... towards a small garden plot... and interacts with a single red, rose-like plant.\" The existing descriptions of the character, well, and garden are good and can be integrated into this more dynamic narrative.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A cartoon character with a round, orange, pumpkin-like head and a simple smiling face, clad in a long, hooded, purple-grey cloak, runs from a central stone well across a grassy area. The character moves towards a small garden plot, which is enclosed by a white picket fence and a stone border. Upon reaching the plot, the character interacts with a single red, rose-like plant, causing small particles to float up from the ground. The well is surrounded by a circular, brown-tiled path, and the scene is set in a yard with other fenced-off areas in the background.",
