    "pre_caption": "This is an architectural scenery shot of a sterile, ascending staircase. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere rather than a specific subject, creating a sense of mystery and anticipation as the camera's perspective moves steadily upwards. The wide staircase is enclosed by walls and a ceiling covered in small, white, square tiles with a faint greenish hue, flanked by simple, thin black handrails. An intensely bright, white, and hazy light floods the space from the top of the stairs, obscuring the destination and lending the scene an ethereal, almost otherworldly quality.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption violates the instruction to avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions by using words like \"sterile,\" \"mystery,\" \"anticipation,\" \"ethereal,\" \"otherworldly,\" \"liberation,\" and \"openness.\" These terms should be removed to maintain an objective tone. The explanation for why it is a scenery shot is overly long and should be condensed. Furthermore, the description of the revealed space at the top of the stairs as having an \"expansive, minimalist design\" is an interpretation rather than a direct observation. The caption should instead describe only what is visible, which is a bright, open area with a high, tiled ceiling. Finally, the caption omits the two small, dark squares that briefly appear within the bright light source at the top of the stairs.",

The walls and ceiling are covered in small, white, square tiles with a faint greenish hue, and the stairs are flanked by thin black handrails. An intensely bright, white, and hazy light emanates from a doorway at the top, obscuring the destination. As the camera moves upwards, two small, dark squares become briefly visible within the bright light before the scene is completely enveloped by it.",
