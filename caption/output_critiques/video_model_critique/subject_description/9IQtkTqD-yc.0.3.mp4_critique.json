A single beam of light illuminates the rough, unpaved path ahead, which is lined on both sides by dense, dark woods with bare trees. There is no main subject in the video; the focus is instead on capturing the isolated and eerie atmosphere of the nocturnal journey through the remote, natural environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption is well-written and adheres to most of the instructions. Here is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the scene as a vehicle's point-of-view traveling on a narrow, wooded road at night.\n*   It accurately describes the visual characteristics imparted by the night-vision lens, such as the \"grainy, monochromatic green glow.\"\n*   The details about the \"rough, unpaved path\" and \"dense, dark woods\" are also correct.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is very complete. It successfully captures all the essential visual information and correctly identifies the video as a scenery shot.\n*   The explanation for why there is no main subject is well-articulated and follows the instructions perfectly.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   The caption is a single, coherent paragraph.\n    *   It correctly identifies the video as a scenery shot and explains why.\n    *   It uses precise, descriptive language (e.g., \"monochromatic green glow,\" \"unpaved path,\" \"bare trees\").\n    *   It avoids referring to specific frames or using forbidden words like \"image.\"\n    *   It correctly describes the scene without speculating on things that are not visible.\n\n*   **Area for Improvement:**\n    *   The instructions state, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption uses the word **\"eerie,\"** which describes an emotional response to the scene rather than a purely visual attribute. While \"isolated\" can be a neutral descriptor of a physical state, \"eerie\" is subjective.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is excellent and very close to perfect. It is accurate, comprehensive, and follows the structural and content guidelines well. The only point of deviation is the use of the subjective adjective \"eerie.\" To fully comply with the instructions, this word should be removed.\n\n**Revised Example (for full compliance):**\n\nThis is a scenery shot of a vehicle traveling down a narrow, wooded road at night, viewed through a night-vision lens that casts a grainy, monochromatic green glow over the landscape. A single beam of light illuminates the rough, unpaved path ahead, which is lined on both sides by dense, dark woods with bare trees. There is no main subject in the video; the focus is instead on capturing the atmosphere of the nocturnal journey through the remote, natural environment.",
