A single beam of light illuminates the rough, unpaved path ahead, which is lined on both sides by dense, dark woods with bare trees. There is no main subject in the video; the focus is instead on capturing the isolated and eerie atmosphere of the nocturnal journey through the remote, natural environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption uses the subjective adjective \"eerie,\" which should be removed as per the instruction to avoid words that convey emotion. The description of the road as \"unpaved\" is an assumption; a more accurate and less speculative term would be \"rough\" or \"poorly maintained.\" Additionally, the caption omits a noticeable visual detail: the small, bright particles, likely dust or insects, that are seen floating in the beam of light throughout the video.",
