    "pre_caption": "This video captures a dynamic cityscape scenery shot of the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel in Paris at night. The monument, with its intricate carvings and a bronze quadriga sculpture on top, is brightly illuminated against the dark sky, where clouds drift by. The surrounding plaza is dotted with streetlights that create a starburst effect, and the blurred motion of people walking around the base of the arch indicates a time-lapse or long-exposure technique. There is no main subject, as the shot's purpose is to convey the grand atmosphere and architectural scale of the iconic landmark. The focus is on the environment and the feeling of a bustling yet timeless Parisian night, rather than on any individual person or object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly begins with the introductory phrase \"This video captures a,\" which should be removed for a more direct description. It also violates the instructions by speculating on the photographic technique (\"indicates a time-lapse or long-exposure technique\") and using subjective, emotional language (\"grand atmosphere,\" \"feeling of a bustling yet timeless Parisian night\"). The description should focus only on what is visually present. Furthermore, the caption omits two noticeable visual elements: the slow, continuous pan of the camera from left to right and the illuminated Ferris wheel visible in the background. The final two sentences explaining the lack of a main subject are slightly redundant and could be combined and made more concise to better adhere to the guidelines.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A dynamic cityscape scenery shot of the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel in Paris at night, with the camera slowly and continuously panning from left to right. The monument, featuring intricate carvings and a bronze quadriga sculpture on top, is brightly illuminated against a dark sky with drifting clouds. Streetlights in the surrounding plaza create a starburst effect, and the blurred motion of people is visible as they walk around the base of the arch. An illuminated Ferris wheel can be seen in the background. The shot has no main subject, focusing instead on the overall environment and the architectural landmark.",
