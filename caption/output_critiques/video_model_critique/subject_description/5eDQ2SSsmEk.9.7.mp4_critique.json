    "pre_caption": "The video features a flying vehicle landing on a platform in space. Initially, only a small portion of the vehicle is visible in the upper-right corner, showing a dark, angular structure with illuminated elements. As the vehicle descends, it becomes fully visible, revealing a sleek, futuristic design with glowing red and blue lights. The vehicle's surface appears metallic and reflective, with distinct geometric shapes. The video concludes with a wide shot of the vehicle resting on the platform, surrounded by beams of light and other space structures, emphasizing its advanced technology and the vastness of the space environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows a flying vehicle landing on a platform in space. Initially, only a small part of the vehicle is visible in the upper-right part of the frame. As the vehicle descends, it is fully gradually revealed, and the shot ends with a wide shot of the vehicle on the platform.**\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good for this video. Here is a detailed breakdown of its issues:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is highly inaccurate. It repeatedly states the setting is \"in space\" and refers to \"space structures.\" The environment is clearly a dark, foggy, futuristic cityscape or industrial complex, not outer space. The small bright dots are more likely illuminated dust, rain, or smog particles rather than stars.\n*   It incorrectly describes the vehicle's actions. The caption claims the vehicle is \"landing\" and later \"resting on the platform.\" The vehicle is shown hovering throughout the entire clip; it never makes contact with the platform.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The description is incomplete as it entirely omits a major subject. To the left of the flying vehicle, there is a suspended, cage-like structure, possibly an elevator, containing several people. This is a significant element of the scene that is completely ignored.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Chronological Narration:** The caption violates the instruction to describe the scene holistically. It breaks the video down into a sequence of events using phrases like \"Initially...\" and \"The video concludes with...\", which is explicitly discouraged.\n*   **Speculation:** The caption makes unsupported claims about the vehicle's actions (\"landing,\" \"resting\") and location (\"in space\"), violating the rule to avoid describing what is not visible or uncertain.\n*   **Subjectivity:** The phrase \"emphasizing its advanced technology and the vastness of the space environment\" is an interpretation of the video's intent, not a neutral description of its visual content. This violates the instruction to avoid subjective language.\n*   **Subject Identification:** While it identifies the \"flying vehicle,\" it fails to identify the other key subject (the cage with people), making the description incomplete.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a high-angle perspective, a dark, blocky flying vehicle hovers in a foggy, futuristic urban environment at night. The vehicle features glowing blue lights on its roof and red taillights, with powerful headlights casting beams down onto a large platform below. To the left of the hovering vehicle, a suspended, cage-like structure, resembling an external elevator, holds several people and is attached to a massive, dark building. The scene is dimly lit, with beams of light cutting through the thick, misty air, which is filled with illuminated particles. Red lights dot the platform and the surrounding structures, contributing to the moody, high-contrast visual style.",
