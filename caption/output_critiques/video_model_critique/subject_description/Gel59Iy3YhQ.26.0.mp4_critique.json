    "pre_caption": "This video presents an interior scenery shot of a dimly lit, narrow attic or storage space, creating a moody and mysterious atmosphere. The room is bathed in an eerie red glow emanating from a string of lights strung across the wooden-slatted ceiling and a prominent red lamp. The walls and ceiling are constructed from dark, horizontal wooden panels, enhancing the claustrophobic feel. A black and white photograph of two intertwined hands hangs from a line, while a piece of furniture sits mysteriously shrouded under a white sheet. There is no single main subject, as the focus is on establishing the environment's atmosphere. The collection of objects and the oppressive lighting work together to tell a story about the space itself rather than highlighting a specific character or item.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly identifies a key subject, describing it as \"a painting depicting two figures from behind.\" The object is a black-and-white photograph of two intertwined hands, one of which has dark nail polish, hanging from a string by a black binder clip. The caption also violates the instruction to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions\" by using words like \"moody,\" \"mysterious,\" \"eerie,\" and \"claustrophobic.\" Furthermore, the final sentence, which explains the video's focus on atmosphere, is an unnecessary interpretation and should be removed to adhere to the instruction of describing only what is visible. The description of the lighting as a \"red glow from a string of lights\" and a \"prominent red lamp\" is accurate but could be slightly more precise by noting the lights are small, individual bulbs on a wire.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video presents an interior shot of a dimly lit, narrow space, such as an attic. The room is illuminated by a string of small, red light bulbs and a larger red lamp, casting a red tint over the scene. The walls and ceiling are constructed from dark, horizontal wooden panels. Hanging from a wire by a black binder clip is a black-and-white photograph of two intertwined hands, one of which has dark nail polish. As the camera pans to the left, a piece of furniture covered by a white sheet becomes visible in the background, along with a narrow hallway.",
