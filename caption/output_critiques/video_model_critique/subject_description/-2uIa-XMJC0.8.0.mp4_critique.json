    "pre_caption": "The video features a person in a room filled with screens. Initially, the scene is devoid of any subjects, but the person soon walks toward the camera. As they approach, the shot transitions to a full view of the person, who is wearing dark clothing. The person then punches the camera, shifting the shot to a middle view. After the action, the shot returns to a full view, with the person still visible among the screens. The focus is on the person's movement and interaction with the camera.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video takes place in a room filled with screens. A person walks toward the camera and then punches it. The shot size transitions from no subject at the beginning to a full shot when the person appears, then to a middle shot as he punch the camera, and finally back to a full shot.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your instructions, here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption:\n\n### Caption Evaluation\n\nThe caption has significant issues with accuracy and completeness, and it does not fully adhere to the provided instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption incorrectly states that \"Initially, the scene is devoid of any subjects.\" The scene is never devoid of subjects; from the beginning, it shows a room filled with glowing screens and equipment, although they are heavily blurred and distorted.\n*   The description of the action is inaccurate. The caption claims, \"The person then punches the camera.\" However, the visual and audio cues suggest the opposite: the camera, representing a first-person point of view, lunges forward, and the man in the room reacts to this movement, which is followed by the sound of a punch. The man does not initiate the punch.\n*   The use of cinematic terms like \"full view\" and \"middle view\" is not accurate for this video. The shot is a continuous, chaotic, and disorienting first-person perspective with heavy motion blur, not a series of standard camera shots.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is not sufficiently descriptive. It omits key visual attributes of the scene, such as the dominant blue and purple neon lighting that defines the atmosphere.\n*   It fails to describe the subjects in enough detail. It uses the generic term \"person\" instead of the more specific \"man.\" It also doesn't mention the high-tech nature of the equipment or the prominent image of a brain scan visible on one of the screens.\n*   The caption does not capture the most defining characteristic of the video: the extremely blurry, distorted, and unstable first-person point-of-view, which is essential to understanding the visual experience.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   The caption violates the instruction to \"avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about\" by misinterpreting the central action of the punch.\n*   It includes a subjective analytical statement, \"The focus is on the person's movement and interaction with the camera,\" rather than sticking to an objective description of the visual content.\n*   By stating the scene is \"devoid of any subjects,\" it fails to describe the objects present from the start, as instructed.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video is shown from a disorienting and extremely blurry first-person perspective, looking into a dark, high-tech room filled with glowing screens and equipment illuminated by dominant blue and purple neon lights. A man in dark clothing comes into focus in the center of the room, standing amidst the futuristic consoles. A large screen behind him displays a glowing image of a brain scan. The camera's point of view suddenly lunges forward toward the man, who reacts to the movement. The sound of a punch is heard as the view becomes even more chaotic and distorted, before settling back to the unstable, blurry view of the man in the room.",
