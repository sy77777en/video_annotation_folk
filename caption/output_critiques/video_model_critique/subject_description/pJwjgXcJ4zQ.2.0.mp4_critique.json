    "pre_caption": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing the vibrant atmosphere of an urban street. The focus is on the bustling environment, showcasing a lively street with people walking along a tiled sidewalk lined with shops and advertisements. The scene transitions to a busy crosswalk, where pedestrians move purposefully across the street, surrounded by tall buildings and traffic signals. The emphasis is on the dynamic and energetic ambiance of city life, rather than any specific individual or object, highlighting the scale and activity of the urban setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption does not fully meet the instruction requirements. While it correctly identifies the video as a cityscape scenery shot and notes the focus on the urban environment rather than specific individuals, it misses the requirement to briefly explain why there is no main subject by referencing the lack of a single salient figure and the emphasis on the collective activity. The caption also incorrectly describes a transition to a busy crosswalk and mentions tall buildings and traffic signals, which are not clearly visible or emphasized in the provided video segment. Additionally, the caption uses subjective language such as \"vibrant atmosphere\" and \"dynamic and energetic ambiance,\" which should be avoided. To improve, the caption should state that the video is a cityscape scenery shot focusing on people walking along a tiled sidewalk lined with shops and advertisements, with no single main subject as the emphasis is on the collective pedestrian activity and the urban setting, and avoid subjective adjectives and references to elements not clearly visible.",
