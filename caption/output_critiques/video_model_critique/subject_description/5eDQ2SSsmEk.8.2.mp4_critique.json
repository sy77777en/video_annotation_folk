    "pre_caption": "The video features a close-up of a man's face, focusing on his mouth and beard. The man has a thick, wet beard with visible droplets of water, suggesting dampness or rain. His lips are slightly parted, and the texture of his facial hair is emphasized by the lighting. In another part of the video, a hand, possibly the man's own, is seen interacting with the beard, pulling or adjusting it, which highlights the strands and wetness. The lighting casts a dramatic effect, with a mix of red and blue tones, creating a striking visual contrast.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good for this video.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the main subject as a close-up of a man's face, specifically his mouth and beard. It accurately describes the beard as \"thick\" and \"wet,\" the lips as \"slightly parted,\" and notes the presence of a hand interacting with the beard. The description of the lighting as a mix of \"red and blue tones\" is also correct.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is comprehensive for such a short and focused clip. It covers all the key visual elements: the subject's features (beard, lips), the action (hand pulling the beard), and the stylistic lighting. It successfully captures the most important details without getting lost in minor points.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The caption is a single, well-structured paragraph that is both concise and rich in detail.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It correctly uses precise terms like \"man\" and \"hand.\"\n*   **Visual Attributes:** It provides specific visual details, such as the \"thick, wet beard,\" \"droplets of water,\" and the \"mix of red and blue tones\" in the lighting.\n*   **Objectivity:** The caption avoids subjective emotional language. While it uses terms like \"dramatic effect\" and \"striking visual contrast,\" these are used appropriately to describe the visual style and lighting, which are prominent features of the video, rather than assigning emotions to the subject.\n*   **Handling Uncertainty:** The phrase \"possibly the man's own\" is an excellent example of adhering to the instruction to avoid stating uncertain information as fact.\n*   **Structure and Focus:** The caption correctly prioritizes the main subject (the man's face) before describing the secondary subject (the hand) and its action, maintaining a logical flow. It does not refer to specific frames and combines the visual information into a coherent whole.\n\nIn summary, the caption is excellent. It perfectly aligns with all the provided instructions, offering a clear, detailed, and objective description of the video's content.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "An extreme close-up shows a man's mouth and thick, wet beard. A hand pulls at the damp strands of facial hair, drawing attention to their texture and wetness. The scene is dramatically lit with a mix of red and blue light against a softly blurred background with bokeh, creating a striking visual contrast.",
