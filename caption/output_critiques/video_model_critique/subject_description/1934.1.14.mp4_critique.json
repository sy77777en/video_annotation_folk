    "pre_caption": "The video features a woman with short, dark hair, wearing a white, form-fitting outfit with orange stripes. Her attire includes a hood that covers most of her head, leaving her face visible. She has a fair skin tone and is shown with a neutral to slightly surprised facial expression. The woman is positioned close to a large, white, rectangular object with a black panel and metallic controls, suggesting she is interacting with or observing it. Her gaze is directed towards the object, indicating focus or attention.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption is a good starting point, but it can be improved in terms of completeness and adherence to the instructions regarding the description of actions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description of the woman's appearance (hair, outfit, skin tone) and the object she is near is accurate.\n*   The description of her expression as \"neutral to slightly surprised\" is an oversimplification. The video shows a clear progression: she first appears to be shouting or calling out, and then her expression changes to one of distinct surprise or shock (wide eyes, open mouth). The caption averages this out into a single, less accurate state.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   **Missing Details:** The caption omits several key visual details. It fails to mention the white gloves the woman is wearing and the white headphones or goggles resting on top of her hood.\n*   **Missing Action:** The most significant omission is the description of the woman's actions. The video is not static; it shows her cupping her hands to her mouth and then turning with a look of shock. The instruction asks to describe \"actions (e.g., ‘the child playing with a ball’),\" and this dynamic element is central to the video's content but is absent from the caption.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths:** You correctly followed the instructions to provide a single paragraph, avoid terms like \"image\" or \"frame,\" use simple English, and focus on the salient subject.\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   The instruction to \"combine details from the frames\" should be used to describe the sequence of events or changes in the subject's state. By describing a static expression, you miss the opportunity to convey the action that unfolds.\n    *   The term \"object\" is a bit vague. While you describe it, a more precise term like \"console\" or \"piece of equipment\" would be better, as per the instruction to use \"precise terms.\"\n\n### Revised Caption Example\n\nHere is an example of a revised caption that incorporates this feedback for a more complete and accurate description:\n\nA woman with short, dark hair and a fair complexion is shown wearing a white, hooded outfit with orange stripes on the shoulders, white gloves, and white headphones resting on her hood. Initially, she cups her hands around her mouth as if shouting. She then turns her head toward a piece of equipment, and her facial expression changes to one of shock, with wide eyes and an open mouth. The equipment is a large, white, rectangular console featuring a black panel with a silver knob and several vertical switches.",
