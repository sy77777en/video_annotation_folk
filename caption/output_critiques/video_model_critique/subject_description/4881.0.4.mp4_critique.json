    "pre_caption": "The video features a person with fair skin, whose hands are shown painting their fingernails with white polish. This individual wears a light blue, fuzzy cardigan over a beige, ribbed top. The video then shows a man with light skin, curly brown hair, and a prominent mustache, who is wearing the same light blue, fuzzy cardigan over a white tank top. He also wears a gold chain necklace and looks directly at the camera with a neutral expression.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good for this video.\n\n### Feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the action of painting fingernails with white polish. It accurately describes the clothing in both segments: the light blue, fuzzy cardigan, the initial beige ribbed top, and the subsequent white tank top on the man. The description of the man—light skin, curly brown hair, prominent mustache, gold chain, and neutral expression—is also precise and matches the visuals perfectly.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is comprehensive and captures the essential narrative of the video. It successfully notes the key transition where the focus shifts from the hands of an unidentified person to the face of a man, cleverly linked by the shared cardigan. It includes all the most salient visual details without getting bogged down in minor background elements.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows all instructions exceptionally well:\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a rich description in a single, easy-to-read paragraph.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It correctly uses \"person\" when the subject is ambiguous and \"man\" when the subject is clearly identifiable.\n*   **Visual Attributes:** It provides specific details about clothing (color, texture, style), physical features (hair, facial hair), and accessories (gold chain).\n*   **No Speculation:** It sticks to what is visually present.\n*   **Structure and Flow:** It is a single, coherent paragraph that describes the video's progression logically (\"The video then shows...\").\n*   **Objectivity:** It uses descriptive, neutral language (\"neutral expression\") instead of subjective emotional terms.\n*   **Transition Description:** It effectively describes the switch between the two parts of the scene, highlighting the change in the person and the top worn under the cardigan.\n\nOverall, the caption is excellent. It is a clear, detailed, and accurate summary of the video content that perfectly adheres to the provided guidelines.",
