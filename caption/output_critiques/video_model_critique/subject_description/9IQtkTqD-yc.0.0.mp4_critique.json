    "pre_caption": "This is a rural landscape scenery shot, captured through night vision. There is no main subject because the focus is on the eerie atmosphere created by the night vision and the brief illumination of a desolate, unpaved road. The scene is initially very dark, with the silhouette of a prominent, bare, gnarled tree and a line of other trees visible against a grainy, greenish sky. Headlights then briefly illuminate the road, revealing its rough surface, some vegetation and a fence line along its edges, and a small, indistinct structure near the trees, before the light extinguishes, returning the scene to near darkness. The emphasis is on the environment and the unsettling feeling of the isolated, dimly lit location rather than a specific object or person.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on this caption. It is highly accurate, detailed, and follows most of the instructions very well. Here is a detailed breakdown of your feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is extremely accurate. It correctly identifies the scene as a rural landscape shot through night vision. It precisely describes the sequence of events: the initial dark view with silhouettes, the brief illumination by headlights, the details revealed by the light (unpaved road, vegetation, fence, structure), and the return to darkness.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe description is very complete. It captures all the key visual information present in the short video, from the prominent gnarled tree to the small, indistinct structure that becomes visible. It successfully conveys the entire action of the clip.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Scenery Shot Protocol:** You correctly identified this as a scenery shot and followed the specific instructions for this case, explaining why there is no main subject and focusing on the environment.\n*   **Descriptive Language:** Your use of descriptive language is a major strength. Phrases like \"prominent, bare, gnarled tree,\" \"grainy, greenish sky,\" and \"rough surface\" are specific, objective, and paint a clear picture.\n*   **Structure and Flow:** The caption is a single, coherent paragraph that logically follows the temporal progression of the video.\n*   **Subjectivity:** This is the one area where the caption deviates from the instructions. The instructions state, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption uses the words \"eerie\" and \"unsettling feeling.\" These terms describe the emotional atmosphere and the viewer's potential reaction, rather than objective visual facts.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe caption is excellent in its accuracy, detail, and structure. Its only flaw is the inclusion of subjective, emotional language, which is explicitly forbidden by the instructions. By removing \"eerie\" and \"unsettling feeling,\" the caption would be a perfect example of adhering to all the given rules.\n\n**Example of a revised sentence:**\n*   **Original:** \"...the focus is on the eerie atmosphere created by the night vision...\"\n*   **Revised:** \"...the focus is on the atmosphere created by the night vision...\"\n\n*   **Original:** \"The emphasis is on the environment and the unsettling feeling of the isolated, dimly lit location...\"\n*   **Revised:** \"The emphasis is on the environment of the isolated, dimly lit location...\"",
