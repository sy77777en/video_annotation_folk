    "pre_caption": "This is a rural landscape scenery shot, captured through night vision. There is no main subject because the focus is on the eerie atmosphere created by the night vision and the brief illumination of a desolate, unpaved road. The scene is initially very dark, with the silhouette of a prominent, bare, gnarled tree and a line of other trees visible against a grainy, greenish sky. Headlights then briefly illuminate the road, revealing its rough surface, some vegetation and a fence line along its edges, and a small, indistinct structure near the trees, before the light extinguishes, returning the scene to near darkness. The emphasis is on the environment and the unsettling feeling of the isolated, dimly lit location rather than a specific object or person.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies this as a rural scenery shot captured through night vision and correctly describes the key visual elements and the change in illumination. However, it violates the instruction to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions\" by using the words \"eerie\" and \"unsettling.\" Additionally, the caption is slightly redundant; the second sentence (\"There is no main subject because...\") and the final sentence (\"The emphasis is on the environment...\") both explain why the focus is on the scenery, making the description longer than necessary. To improve, remove the subjective adjectives and combine the redundant explanations into a single, more concise statement at the beginning of the paragraph.",
