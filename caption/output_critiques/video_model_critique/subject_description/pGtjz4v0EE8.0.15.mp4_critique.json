    "pre_caption": "This video presents a bustling cityscape scenery shot of a historic European square. There is no single main subject, as the camera's broad, panning view is intended to capture the grand scale of the architecture and the lively atmosphere of the crowd rather than focusing on an individual. The scene unfolds on a bright, sunny day in what appears to be St. Mark's Square in Venice, teeming with tourists. In the background stands the magnificent, ornate facade of St. Mark's Basilica, with its grand arches and domes, though a portion of it is obscured by white scaffolding. To the right, the distinctive Gothic architecture of the Doge's Palace extends with its long, elegant colonnade. The square itself is filled with people in casual attire, some admiring the buildings, others walking through the crowd, and a few gathered around a souvenir cart selling colorful t-shirts and hats.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly treats two distinct shots as a single, continuous scene, failing to mention the hard cut at the 00:01 mark and describe the subjects in each segment separately as required. It completely omits the salient foreground subjects from the first shot, including a woman with dark hair in a purple top, an older woman with blonde hair and glasses, and a man in a blue shirt. The description of a \"broad, panning view\" is only accurate for the second shot, not the first. Furthermore, the caption violates the instructions by using subjective and emotional adjectives such as \"vibrant,\" \"magnificent,\" and \"elegant.\" The description should be restructured to describe the subjects of the first shot, then note the hard cut, and finally describe the wider scenery shot and the different group of people in the second segment.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video begins with a medium shot in a crowded square on a sunny day. In the foreground, a woman with dark hair in a purple top is seen from the side, next to an older woman with blonde hair and glasses. To the left, a man in a blue shirt walks away from a souvenir cart that is selling t-shirts and other items. In the background is the ornate facade of St. Mark's Basilica, with a section covered by white scaffolding, and to the right is the Doge's Palace with its ground-level colonnade.\n\nAt 00:01, there is a hard cut to a wider shot of the same square, taken from a different position. A new group of tourists is in the foreground, standing behind a low barrier. The wider perspective shows more of the crowd and the surrounding architecture, including the St. Mark's Clocktower on the far left, the basilica in the center, and the Doge's Palace on the right.",
