    "pre_caption": "The video features a man with a medium skin tone and a short, neatly trimmed beard. He has closely cropped hair and is wearing a light-colored, short-sleeved shirt with a collar. The man is seated and facing forward, with a serious expression. He is gesturing with his right hand, holding up his index finger. The lighting highlights his facial features, emphasizing his focused demeanor.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on your instructions, here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. The description of the man's physical attributes (medium skin tone, closely cropped hair, beard, light-colored collared shirt) and his actions (seated, gesturing with his index finger) correctly reflects the content of the video.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe description is good but could be slightly more complete. For instance, the man's beard is more specifically a goatee with visible grey hairs (salt-and-pepper), and his shirt has some dark vertical stripes or details. While not essential, adding these specifics would create a more vivid picture.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption follows most instructions well, but it falters on one key point: objectivity.\n\n*   **Strengths:** The caption is a single, concise paragraph, uses simple English, correctly identifies the subject as a \"man,\" and focuses on the main subject without getting distracted by the out-of-focus background. It avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement:** The main issue is the use of subjective language, which the instructions explicitly forbid (\"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions\").\n    *   **\"with a serious expression\"**: While his expression could be interpreted as serious, this is a subjective judgment. A more objective description would focus on the physical characteristics of the expression, such as \"his brow is furrowed and his eyes are narrowed.\"\n    *   **\"emphasizing his focused demeanor\"**: This phrase is highly interpretive. \"Demeanor\" describes a person's internal state and manner, which cannot be seen directly. The instruction is to describe visual attributes, not infer psychological states. The part about the lighting highlighting his features is good, but the conclusion about his \"demeanor\" violates the rule.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is a strong attempt that is accurate and well-structured. Its primary weakness is the inclusion of subjective interpretations of the man's emotional and mental state (\"serious expression,\" \"focused demeanor\"), which goes against the specific instruction to remain objective and describe only what is visually present. To be fully compliant, these subjective terms should be replaced with descriptions of his physical facial features.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A man with a medium skin tone, closely cropped hair, and a salt-and-pepper goatee is shown in a close-up. He wears a light-colored, short-sleeved collared shirt with dark vertical details. Seated in a booth with red upholstery, his brow is furrowed and his eyes are narrowed. He raises his right index finger, touching it to his lips. The scene is dimly lit, with lighting that highlights his facial features against a dark, blurry background.",
