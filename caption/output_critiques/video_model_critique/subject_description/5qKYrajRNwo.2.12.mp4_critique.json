    "pre_caption": "The video features a pair of hands holding a framed photograph. The hands are small, suggesting they belong to a child, and have a light skin tone. The photograph within the frame depicts a group of animated characters. At the center is a man with dark hair and a mustache, wearing a dark suit and tie. Next to him is a woman with gray hair, glasses, and a colorful dress. Flanking them are two children, both with short dark hair, wearing simple clothing. The photograph is set against a vibrant background. Surrounding the hands and photograph are various items, including folded clothes and a red pouch, suggesting the setting is a storage space or drawer.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is generally good, providing a clear and structured description of the scene. However, it has a few key areas where it deviates from the instructions and could be improved for accuracy and completeness.\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   **Partially Inaccurate:** The most significant inaccuracy is the failure to identify the subjects as stop-motion or claymation figures. The caption describes \"a pair of hands\" and \"animated characters,\" which is too general. The distinct, textured, and slightly artificial appearance of the hands and the figures in the photograph clearly indicates they are puppets used in stop-motion animation, not live-action people or 2D drawings. This is a fundamental visual attribute of the subjects that has been missed.\n*   **Vague Description:** The description of the woman's attire as a \"colorful dress\" is vague. It is more specifically a yellow or orange garment, possibly a sari, and she is wearing a medal or a large flower pinned to it.\n\n### Completeness\n\n*   **Incomplete Subject Type:** The description is incomplete because it omits the specific medium of the characters (stop-motion/claymation). This detail is crucial for a full understanding of the visual style.\n*   **Missing Detail:** The caption mentions the hands are small but doesn't note their puppet-like, non-human texture and form, which is immediately apparent.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid what you are unsure about\":** The caption states the hands are \"suggesting they belong to a child.\" This is an inference based on their size, which the instructions explicitly forbid (\"You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about\"). You should only describe their size (small) without assigning an age.\n*   **Violation of \"Don't mention the background unless necessary\":** The final sentence, \"Surrounding the hands and photograph are various items, including folded clothes and a red pouch, suggesting the setting is a storage space or drawer,\" describes the background. The instructions state to avoid this unless it's essential to distinguish the subjects. Here, the focus is clearly on the hands and the photograph they hold, making the description of the drawer's contents an unnecessary detail that violates the rule.\n*   **Violation of \"Describe key visual attributes in detail\":** By using the general term \"animated characters\" instead of the more precise \"stop-motion figures\" or \"claymation characters,\" the caption fails to describe a key visual attribute as instructed.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a top-down perspective, a pair of small, stop-motion puppet hands with a light, matte skin tone holds up a wooden-framed photograph. The photograph depicts a group of four claymation-style figures. In the center, a male figure with a mustache and dark hair wears a dark suit. Beside him, a female figure with gray hair and glasses wears an orange garment and a medal with a red ribbon. Two smaller figures with dark hair stand on either side of the central pair.",
