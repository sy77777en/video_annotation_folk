    "pre_caption": "The video features a white egret with long legs and a slender neck, standing on a patch of dense green grass by the edge of a calm body of water. The egret is positioned with its head lowered, likely searching for food in the water. Its feathers are smooth and bright, contrasting with the surrounding greenery.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "The user wants me to evaluate a caption for a video.\n\n**Video Analysis:**\n- The video shows a white bird, an egret, on the grassy bank of a body of water.\n- The egret is initially hunched over, looking into the water.\n- It then lunges forward, seemingly trying to catch something, but misses.\n- It then stands up straight, looks around, and then walks out of the frame.\n- The water is calm and greenish, reflecting the bird and the bank.\n- The bank is covered in green and brown grasses.\n\n**Caption Analysis:**\n- **\"The video features a white egret with long legs and a slender neck, standing on a patch of dense green grass by the edge of a calm body of water.\"** - Accurate. It correctly identifies the bird as an egret and describes its key features and location.\n- **\"The egret is positioned with its head lowered, likely searching for food in the water.\"** - Accurate for the beginning of the video. The \"likely searching for food\" is an inference, but a very reasonable one based on the bird's behavior. The instructions say \"avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about,\" but this is a very common and well-understood behavior for this type of bird. It's a borderline case, but acceptable.\n- **\"Its feathers are smooth and bright, contrasting with the surrounding greenery.\"** - Accurate description of visual attributes.\n- **\"The water reflects the scene, adding a serene quality to the setting.\"** - The first part is accurate (\"The water reflects the scene\"). The second part (\"adding a serene quality to the setting\") is a subjective adjective conveying emotion, which the instructions explicitly forbid (\"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions\").\n- **\"The egret's presence is the focal point, highlighting its interaction with the natural environment.\"** - This is more of a summary or interpretation rather than a direct description of what is visible. It's not wrong, but it's not following the \"describe what you see\" rule as strictly as it could.\n- **Overall Completeness:** The caption misses the key action in the video: the egret's failed attempt to catch something. It describes the initial pose but not the subsequent lunge and failure. The instruction says \"describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one,\" and the action is a key detail across the frames.\n- **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    - **Concise and informative:** Mostly, but could be more focused on the action.\n    - **Subject types and visual attributes:** Good. \"White egret,\" \"long legs,\" \"slender neck,\" \"dense green grass.\"\n    - **Combining details from frames:** Fails here by only describing the initial state and not the action that follows.\n    - **Avoid \"image\" or \"frame\":** Adhered.\n    - **Background/motion:** Mentions the water, which is appropriate as it's part of the subject's environment and interaction. It misses the key motion of the egret.\n    - **Avoid what's not visible/unsure:** Mostly adhered, though \"likely searching for food\" is a slight inference.\n    - **Simple, natural English:** Adhered.\n    - **One-paragraph, no markdown/intro:** Adhered.\n    - **Precise terms:** \"Egret\" is good.\n    - **Key visual attributes:** Good.\n    - **Pose and orientation:** Good for the initial state (\"head lowered\").\n    - **Subject prioritization:** Correctly focuses on the egret.\n    - **Avoid subjective adjectives:** Fails with \"serene quality.\"\n\n**Feedback Formulation:**\n\n1.  **Accuracy:** The caption is accurate in its description of the subject (a white egret) and its initial state. It correctly identifies the setting (grassy bank by water).\n2.  **Completeness:** The caption is incomplete. It describes the egret's initial pose (\"head lowered, likely searching for food\") but completely omits the central action of the video: the egret lunging forward in an unsuccessful attempt to catch prey. A complete description should incorporate this key event.\n3.  **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Violation of \"No Subjective Adjectives\":** The phrase \"adding a serene quality to the setting\" violates the instruction to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" \"Serene\" is an emotional interpretation of the scene.\n    *   **Violation of \"Describe the whole video\":** The caption fails to \"describe the video by combining details from the frames.\" It only describes the initial setup and misses the main action, which is a crucial part of the video's content.\n    *   **Metacommentary:** The final sentence, \"The egret's presence is the focal point, highlighting its interaction with the natural environment,\" is more of an analysis or summary of the shot's composition rather than a direct description of the visible subjects and their actions, which is what the instructions call for.\n\n**Revised Caption (for my own reference, to help structure the feedback):**\nA white egret with long legs, a slender neck, and a yellow beak stands on a grassy bank next to a calm body of water. Initially, it is hunched over, peering into the water. It then quickly lunges forward with its beak open, attempting to catch something, but comes up empty. After the failed attempt, it stands up straight before walking out of view.\n\nThis revised version includes the action, avoids subjective terms, and sticks to a direct description. I will use this as a basis to explain what the original caption missed.\n\n**Final Feedback Structure:**\n- Start with a positive note on accuracy.\n- Point out the major issue: incompleteness regarding the action.\n- Point out the specific instruction violations: subjective language (\"serene\") and metacommentary (\"focal point\").\n- Conclude with a summary of how to improve: focus on describing the entire sequence of actions and stick strictly to objective, visual details.",
