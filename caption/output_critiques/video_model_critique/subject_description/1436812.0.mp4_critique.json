    "pre_caption": "The video is a landscape scenery shot, capturing a sweeping aerial view of a dramatic canyon with rugged, sunlit cliffs and a winding road that curves gracefully along the edge of the plateau. The terrain is characterized by golden-brown grasses and sparse vegetation, with patches of green trees accentuating the contours of the land. In the distance, a wide river glimmers under soft daylight, bordered by layered hills and expansive valleys that stretch toward the horizon. There is no main subject in this video, as the focus is on the vastness and natural beauty of the environment, emphasizing the scale and atmosphere of the landscape rather than any specific object or individual.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption omits a key subject visible in the video: there are several cars traveling along the winding road atop the plateau, which should be mentioned as salient non-scenery subjects. The caption should be revised to include a brief description of the cars, such as their number, color, and position on the road, as these are visually distinct and relevant. Otherwise, the landscape and environmental details are accurately and concisely described, and the caption avoids unnecessary background or motion details. To improve, add a sentence noting the presence and appearance of the cars to fully meet the instruction requirements.",
