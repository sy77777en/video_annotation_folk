    "pre_caption": "The video features a person on an ascending escalator, viewed from behind. The person, whose upper body is visible from above the chest, occupies half the height of the frame. They have shoulder-length, light-colored hair and are wearing a dark jacket. The camera captures the person centrally, emphasizing their presence while also showing the surrounding escalator and tiled walls. The setting suggests an indoor environment, likely a subway or shopping center, with fluorescent lighting reflecting off the surfaces.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows an escalator scene, with the camera positioned on an ascending escalator, filming from behind a person. Only the person's upper body above the chest is visible, taking up half the height of the frame, leaving more content for the surroundings.**\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description of the visual content. It correctly identifies a person with \"shoulder-length, light-colored hair\" wearing a \"dark jacket\" on an \"ascending escalator.\" The description of the setting as an indoor environment with \"tiled walls\" and \"fluorescent lighting\" is also factually correct.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete, perhaps to a fault. It thoroughly describes the main subject's appearance, orientation (\"viewed from behind\"), and action. It also provides a comprehensive description of the surrounding environment.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption fails to adhere to several key instructions, which significantly impacts its quality based on the provided rules.\n\n*   **Violation of \"Don't mention the background\":** The instruction states, \"Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects.\" The last two sentences (\"The camera captures the person centrally... with fluorescent lighting reflecting off the surfaces\") are almost entirely dedicated to describing the background, setting, and camera work, which is not necessary to describe the person.\n*   **Violation of \"avoid using terms like 'image' or 'frame'\":** The caption explicitly uses the word \"frame\" (\"occupies half the height of the frame\"), which is a direct violation of the instructions.\n*   **Violation of \"avoid describing what you are unsure about\":** The phrase \"likely a subway or shopping center\" is a form of speculation, which the instructions prohibit.\n*   **Lack of Conciseness:** By including extensive details about the background and camera composition, the caption is not as concise as it could be. The focus shifts from the subject to the overall scene and its cinematography.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile the caption is factually accurate and provides a good sense of the video's content, it is not a good caption **according to the specific rules given**. It violates several negative constraints, including the prohibitions on mentioning the background, using the word \"frame,\" and speculating. A better caption would focus solely on the subject as instructed.\n\n**Example of a more compliant caption:**\n\nA person with shoulder-length, light-colored hair is seen from behind while riding up an escalator. They are wearing a dark jacket, and their upper body is visible.",
