    "pre_caption": "The video features a close-up of a hand holding a blue spool, with a string extending upwards. The hand appears to be of medium skin tone and is wearing a dark wristband. The string leads to several small kites visible against a clear sky. The kites are red and appear to be flying at different heights. In the background, there are people gathered, possibly watching the kites, and some buildings are visible in the distance. The scene conveys a sense of outdoor activity and leisure.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption is a good attempt, but it has some inaccuracies and violates a key instruction. Here is a detailed breakdown of the feedback.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **Partially Inaccurate:** The caption states the kites are \"red,\" but there is also a yellow or light green kite visible.\n*   **Inaccurate:** The caption describes the sky as \"clear,\" but it is actually overcast and hazy.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully identifies the main subjects (hand, spool, kites) and their key attributes.\n*   It omits the camera's motion, which is a slow upward pan following the kite string. While not strictly required, mentioning it would add more detail about the action.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid Subjectivity\":** The final sentence, \"The scene conveys a sense of outdoor activity and leisure,\" is a subjective interpretation of the mood. The instructions explicitly state, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" This sentence should be removed.\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid Uncertainty\":** The phrase \"possibly watching the kites\" is an inference. While it's a logical assumption, the instructions state, \"You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\" It's better to simply state that people are present in the background.\n*   **Adherence to Structure and Focus:** The caption correctly follows the paragraph format, prioritizes the main subject in the foreground, and uses precise terms for the subjects.\n\n### Corrected Example Caption\n\nHere is a revised version of the caption that adheres to all instructions:\n\nFrom a first-person perspective, a hand with a medium skin tone and a black watch holds a blue plastic kite winder. A thin white string unwinds from the winder and extends upward into the overcast sky. High in the sky, several small, diamond-shaped kites, including red and yellow ones, fly at various altitudes. In the distant background, there is green foliage, a group of people, and several houses.",
