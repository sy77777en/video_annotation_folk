    "pre_caption": "The video features a sports car with a striking red, blue, and white color scheme. The front of the car displays large numbers, \"+30°\" and \"30°,\" prominently on the hood. The car's sleek design includes aerodynamic curves and a visible logo on the front. In the latter part of the video, the car is seen from the rear, showcasing its dynamic shape and dual exhausts. The car is in motion, with snow being kicked up around it, indicating it is driving on a snowy surface. The overall design and markings suggest a high-performance vehicle, possibly used for racing or testing in cold conditions.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption is a good attempt, but it has several inaccuracies and omissions when compared to the video content and the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption incorrectly states the numbers on the hood are \"+30°\" and \"30°.\" The video clearly shows \"-30°\" on the blue side and \"+30°\" on the red side.\n*   The caption claims the car is \"seen from the rear, showcasing its dynamic shape and dual exhausts.\" This is incorrect. The video only shows the car from the front, top, and side; the rear of the car and any exhausts are never visible.\n*   The mention of a \"visible logo on the front\" is vague. While a Porsche crest might be there, it's not clearly discernible. A more accurate detail would be the white \"PORSCHE\" text on the black banner across the top of the windshield.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The description omits several key markings visible on the car, such as the hashtag \"#Drive2Extremes\" on the hood and the large white circle with \"-30°\" on the blue driver's side door. These details are prominent and central to the car's livery.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Subjective Adjectives:** The caption uses the word \"striking,\" which is a subjective adjective conveying emotion or opinion, violating the instruction to avoid such terms. \"Sleek\" and \"dynamic\" are also borderline subjective.\n*   **Speculation:** The final sentence, \"possibly used for racing or testing in cold conditions,\" is an inference. While it's a logical conclusion based on the visuals, the instructions advise against describing what you are unsure about. A more descriptive approach would be to simply state the facts that lead to this conclusion (e.g., \"The car's markings include temperature indicators and the hashtag '#Drive2Extremes'\").\n*   **Shot Transitions:** The caption attempts to describe a change in perspective (\"In the latter part of the video...\") but, as noted, the description of what is seen in that part is factually incorrect. It fails to capture the multiple, quick-cutting camera angles (front-on, top-down, low-angle side view).\n\nIn summary, the caption correctly identifies the main subject and its general action but fails on several key points of accuracy and detail. To improve, it needs to correct the factual errors regarding the car's markings and visible parts, include the omitted details like the hashtag, remove subjective language, and more accurately describe the perspectives shown throughout the video.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video shows a car with a blue and red livery, split vertically down the center, driving at speed on a snow-covered surface. The hood is marked with \"-30°\" on the blue half and \"+30°\" on the red half, with the hashtag \"#Drive2Extremes\" written between them. A black banner with \"PORSCHE\" in white text is visible across the top of the windshield. The video cuts between several camera angles, including a high-angle view of the hood, a front-on shot of the approaching car, a top-down view of the roof, and a low-angle side shot. The blue driver's side of the car features a large white circle containing \"-30°\". As the car moves, its wheels spin and kick up snow, and motion blur is visible in the shots.",
