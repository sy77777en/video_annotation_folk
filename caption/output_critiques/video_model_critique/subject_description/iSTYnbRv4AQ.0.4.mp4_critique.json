    "pre_caption": "This video is a dynamic cityscape scenery shot taken at night. The scene is characterized by a significant motion blur that streaks the lights from buildings and street lamps, creating an energetic and slightly disorienting effect. In the background, multi-story European-style buildings with illuminated windows line a street, while a large, light-colored vehicle, possibly a tour bus, moves through the center of the frame, its form elongated and distorted by the camera's movement. There is no main subject, as the intentional blur and rapid motion shift the focus to the overall atmosphere and kinetic energy of the urban environment rather than any specific person or object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the video as a scenery shot and correctly explains the absence of a main subject due to the intentional motion blur, which aligns with the instructions. However, it includes the phrase \"creating an energetic and slightly disorienting effect,\" which uses subjective adjectives (\"energetic,\" \"disorienting\") to describe an experience rather than a visual attribute, violating the instruction to avoid such terms. Additionally, the final sentence's explanation that the focus shifts to \"the overall atmosphere and kinetic energy of the urban environment\" is overly interpretive. The caption should be revised to remove the subjective phrase and rephrase the final sentence to be more direct and descriptive, stating simply that the focus is on the motion-blurred scene itself rather than any specific subject.",
