    "pre_caption": "The video depicts a bustling street scene with various people walking along a pathway lined with shops. The individuals are diverse in appearance, wearing casual clothing such as jackets, sweaters, and masks. Some are holding items like bags or drinks. The street is populated with both men and women, and the atmosphere suggests a lively, everyday setting. A few people are seen walking in pairs or small groups, indicating social interactions. The scene includes a mix of ages, with adults being the most prominent. The setting is urban, with visible elements like a vending machine and shop signs contributing to the commercial environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects with no clear main focus**. Because it does not emphasize any specific subject, please briefly describe the types of subjects without going into too much detail. You may also describe the subjects collectively as a group.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption generally follows the instruction by describing the street scene, the presence of multiple people, and their casual attire and masks. However, it could be improved by providing more specific visual details about the subjects, such as the colors and styles of their clothing (e.g., a woman in a beige coat and long skirt, a man in a striped sweater, a man in a gray sweatshirt), and by distinguishing between individuals or groups when possible. The mention of \"diverse in appearance\" is vague and should be replaced with concrete visual traits. The reference to \"atmosphere\" is unnecessary and subjective, and the background details about the vending machine and shop signs should only be included if they help distinguish subject locations or actions. The caption should avoid generalizations like \"the atmosphere suggests a lively, everyday setting\" and instead focus on what is visually evident. To improve, the caption should concisely list the main types of people visible, their key clothing features, and any notable actions or groupings, while omitting subjective or redundant information.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video shows a busy urban street with people walking along a pathway lined with shops. A woman in a beige coat and long skirt walks beside a man in a striped sweater, while another man in a gray sweatshirt carries a shopping bag. A group of three young adults, two women and a man, chat animatedly as they pass by. A middle-aged man in a blue jacket sips from a coffee cup. The scene includes a mix of ages, with adults being the most prominent. A vending machine and shop signs are visible in the background, adding to the commercial setting.",
