    "pre_caption": "A grassy area in the foreground contains a prominent, leafless tree on the left. A paved road in the midground carries several cars, including a silver sedan and a black sedan, moving from right to left. On the sidewalk beyond the road, pedestrians are present: one individual wears a dark jacket and dark pants, while another is dressed in a light-colored top and light pants, both walking from right to left. Further in the background, additional pedestrians, other leafless trees, traffic lights, and multi-story brick buildings are visible.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects with no clear main focus**. Because it does not emphasize any specific subject, please briefly describe the types of subjects without going into too much detail. You may also describe the subjects collectively as a group.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good for this video.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies all the main subjects: the grassy foreground with a leafless tree, the road with moving cars (a silver and a black sedan), the two primary pedestrians on the sidewalk with their respective clothing, and the background elements like other pedestrians, trees, and buildings. All described details are present in the video.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is comprehensive, covering the scene from foreground to background. It captures the most salient actions, such as the cars and pedestrians moving from right to left, which gives a dynamic sense of the scene. It successfully provides a full picture without getting bogged down in minor, irrelevant details.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is a single, well-structured paragraph written in clear, natural English. It is both concise and informative.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It uses precise terms like \"tree,\" \"cars,\" \"sedan,\" and \"pedestrians\" instead of vague words.\n*   **Attribute Description:** It provides specific visual attributes for the subjects, such as \"leafless tree,\" \"silver sedan,\" \"dark jacket,\" and \"multi-story brick buildings.\"\n*   **Distinguishing Subjects:** It effectively distinguishes between similar subjects, for example, by specifying the color of the cars (\"silver sedan and a black sedan\") and the clothing of the pedestrians.\n*   **Avoiding Speculation:** The caption correctly uses the neutral term \"individual\" for the pedestrians, avoiding any guesses about gender, which adheres to the instruction to not describe what is uncertain.\n*   **Structure and Focus:** The description is logically organized, moving from the foreground to the background. It correctly focuses on the salient subjects (pedestrians and cars) while still setting the scene.\n*   **Proper Use of Motion:** It appropriately describes the motion of the cars and pedestrians (\"moving from right to left,\" \"walking from right to left\") as this is a key aspect of their presence in the video.\n*   **Formatting:** It correctly returns only the single-paragraph description without any introductory text or markdown.\n\nOverall, the caption is an excellent example of following the instructions precisely. It is accurate, detailed, and well-written.",
