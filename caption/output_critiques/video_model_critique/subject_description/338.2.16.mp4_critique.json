    "pre_caption": "The video features a woman with medium skin tone and straight, shoulder-length dark hair. She is wearing large, round glasses and a teal hoodie with a zipper. Her expression is calm and slightly smiling. The woman is facing forward, and her head is slightly tilted to one side. She appears relaxed and is the central focus of the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback on the caption is as follows:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is mostly accurate. The subject is a woman with the described hair and skin tone, wearing a teal hoodie. However, the glasses are more geometric or hexagonal than \"round.\"\n\n**Completeness:** The description is incomplete and misses several key visual details. It fails to mention that the woman's eyes are closed, which is a significant part of her expression. It also omits the gold nameplate necklace she is wearing and the striped shirt visible under her partially unzipped hoodie. The texture of the hoodie, which appears to be velour or velvet, is also not described.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres to many instructions, such as being a single paragraph, avoiding terms like \"image,\" and focusing on the main subject. However, it violates the rule to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions\" by using the words \"calm\" and \"relaxed.\" While her expression might evoke these feelings, the description should stick to physical attributes like \"eyes closed\" and \"slight smile.\"\n\nIn summary, the caption provides a decent overview but lacks the specific detail required by the instructions and includes prohibited subjective language.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A woman with a medium skin tone and straight, shoulder-length dark hair is the central focus of the frame. She is wearing large, geometric-framed glasses and has her eyes closed with a slight smile on her face. She is dressed in a teal velour hoodie, which is partially unzipped, revealing a striped shirt underneath. A gold nameplate necklace is visible at her collar. The woman faces forward, her head tilted slightly to one side.",
