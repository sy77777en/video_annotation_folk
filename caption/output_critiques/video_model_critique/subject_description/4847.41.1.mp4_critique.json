    "pre_caption": "The video captures a small boat with five people on board approaching a large ship. The boat is in the sea, and the individuals appear to be rowing. As the boat nears the ship, the camera pans right, revealing part of the ship's structure and a person standing on the deck. This person is positioned on the right side of the frame, observing the approaching boat. The scene highlights the interaction between the small boat and the large ship, with the focus shifting from the boat to include the ship's deck and the person on it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **This video shows a small boat approaching a large ship. The camera, positioned on the large ship, captures the small boat in the sea with five people on board. As the boat gets closer, the camera pans right to track it, revealing part of the large ship and a person on deck.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is excellent feedback. Here's a breakdown of why it's so effective:\n\n**Caption Accuracy:**\n*   **Accurate:** The caption correctly identifies the main subjects (a small boat, people, a large ship) and the primary action (the boat approaching the ship). It also accurately notes the appearance of a person on the ship's deck.\n*   **Inaccurate:**\n    *   The claim of \"five people\" is speculative. Due to the sepia tone and low resolution of the old film, it's impossible to count the individuals in the boat with certainty. The instructions explicitly state to \"avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\"\n    *   The statement \"the camera pans right\" is incorrect. The camera remains static. The right side of the ship and the person on deck are revealed because the rowboat moves closer to the fixed viewpoint of the camera, which is positioned on the large ship.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully covers the sequence of events.\n*   However, it is incomplete because it omits several key visual details that are clearly visible and required by the instructions. It fails to mention:\n    *   The prominent, thick ropes in the foreground that frame the shot, indicating the viewpoint is from a larger vessel's rigging.\n    *   The overall sepia tone of the footage, which suggests its age.\n    *   Any specific attributes of the subjects, such as the dark, indistinct appearance of the figures in the boat or the fact that the man on the deck is wearing a cap.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths:** The caption is a single paragraph, uses simple English, avoids frame-specific references, and correctly identifies subject types.\n*   **Weaknesses:**\n    *   **Violation of \"No Speculation\":** The count of \"five people\" is a guess.\n    *   **Failure to Describe Visual Attributes:** The instructions demand detailed descriptions of \"clothing color and style,\" \"material,\" \"shape,\" and other features. The caption is far too general and lacks this required level of detail.\n    *   **Inaccurate Description of Action:** The misidentification of the camera movement as a \"pan\" is a significant error in describing how the scene unfolds.\n    *   **Interpretive Language:** The final sentence (\"The scene highlights the interaction...\") is more of an analysis of the scene's theme rather than a direct, objective description of its visual content, which strays from the core instruction to describe subjects and their attributes.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This sepia-toned, archival footage is filmed from a high angle on a large vessel, with the view partially framed by several thick, dark ropes in the foreground. In the distance, a small, dark rowboat with several indistinct figures aboard is being rowed across the calm water. As the rowboat approaches the larger vessel, the side of the ship's deck comes into view on the right. A man in a dark uniform and cap stands on the deck, leaning over the railing to watch the rowboat below.",
