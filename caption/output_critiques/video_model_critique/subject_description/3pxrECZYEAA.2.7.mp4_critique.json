    "pre_caption": "The video features a cartoon-style scene set in a bar. A man with light skin and short blonde hair is behind the bar counter. He wears a dark brown shirt and is initially resting his head on his hand, then later drinking from a bottle. The bar is stocked with various bottles and cans, organized neatly on shelves. The walls are adorned with colorful posters, including a dartboard and a neon sign that reads \"Beer.\" The floor has a checkered pattern, and a potted plant is visible on the left side. The setting is vibrant, with a warm color palette dominated by reds and yellows.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is overly descriptive of the background and setting, violating the instruction to focus on salient subjects. It also includes subjective analysis and describes camera motion unnecessarily. The sentence \"The setting is vibrant, with a warm color palette dominated by reds and yellows, effectively juxtaposed with the darker, cooler colors outside\" should be removed because it uses subjective words (\"vibrant,\" \"effectively\") and provides artistic analysis instead of describing subjects. The final sentence, \"As the video progresses, the focus shifts inward, reducing the visibility of the exterior,\" describes a minor camera movement that is not essential to the subject's actions and should be deleted. Furthermore, the caption omits prominent foreground subjects; while it mentions the potted plant on the left, it fails to include the stereo system on a cabinet and the framed picture of a blue, TV-headed figure on the right. The description of the bar's decor (posters, floor, shelves) should be significantly condensed to maintain focus on the primary and secondary subjects.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is a cartoon-style animation showing a scene from two different perspectives. The foreground is a dark, purple-hued room containing a large potted plant on the left, and a stereo system on a cabinet and a framed picture of a blue, reclining figure with a television for a head on the right. Through an opening between these objects, a brightly lit red and yellow bar is visible. A man with short blonde hair and a brown shirt stands behind the bar counter. He is initially seen resting his head on his hand before sitting up and taking a drink from a white cup. The bar behind him is stocked with bottles and features a neon \"Beer\" sign and a dartboard on the wall.",
