    "pre_caption": "The video features a stylized, animated green eel-like creature with a smooth, elongated body and a prominent red eye with a yellow outline. The creature is depicted weaving through dark, abstract plant-like shapes. Its body is sleek and streamlined, with a subtle gradient that adds depth. The red eye is striking against the green body, drawing attention to the creature's head. The eel's movement through the plants suggests a sense of fluidity and grace. The overall scene is characterized by its bold colors and simple, graphic style.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption is a good starting point, but it has some significant issues regarding accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is inaccurate when it states the creature has \"a prominent red eye.\" At the beginning of the video, the creature clearly has two large red eyes.\n*   A major inaccuracy is the complete omission of the second subject. There is a prominent red, textured, spherical object in the scene, which the creature's tail is near at the start. Your description fails to mention it entirely.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The description is incomplete because it only describes one of the two main subjects (the creature) and the environment. A complete description must include the red sphere.\n*   While you describe the creature as \"eel-like,\" a more precise description might be \"tadpole-like\" due to its large head and tapering tail, but \"eel-like\" is an acceptable interpretation.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Subjectivity:** The caption violates the instruction to \"avoid subjective adjectives.\" Words and phrases like \"striking,\" \"drawing attention,\" \"fluidity,\" and \"grace\" are subjective interpretations of the visual information rather than objective descriptions.\n*   **Focus:** The instruction asks you to focus on the subjects. While describing the creature is correct, the last sentence, \"The overall scene is characterized by its bold colors and simple, graphic style,\" describes the artistic style rather than the subjects themselves, which is less of a priority.\n*   **Subject Identification:** The instructions require you to \"Clearly identify each subject’s type.\" By failing to mention the red sphere, you have not identified all the subjects in the scene.\n\nIn summary, the caption successfully identifies and describes the main creature's appearance and actions in a single paragraph. However, it fails by being inaccurate about the number of eyes, incomplete by omitting a key subject, and non-compliant by using subjective language.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a stylized, animated underwater scene, a green, tadpole-like creature with two large red eyes with yellow sclera swims from right to left. The creature has a smooth, elongated body that tapers into a tail, and it weaves between dark, abstract, plant-like silhouettes set against a dark blue background. On the right side of the frame, there is a red, spherical object with a textured, stippled surface. As the clip begins, the creature's tail is positioned near this red sphere before it swims away.",
