    "pre_caption": "This video presents an interior scenery shot. There is no main subject because the focus is deliberately placed on the overall atmosphere and environment of the dimly lit room rather than singling out a specific object or person. The composition includes a dark wooden door, slightly ajar, revealing a sliver of light, flanked by a wall with a light switch, a framed picture, and a side table holding a lamp, a framed photo, and a bowl. To the right of the door, another larger framed artwork hangs on the wall. The static camera and low lighting contribute to establishing a specific mood and sense of place, making the setting itself the primary point of interest.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains a factual error and omits several key visual details. The object in the lower right corner is not a \"potted plant\" but appears to be the wooden slats of a piece of furniture, possibly a crib. The description of the door is missing the small, central peephole. The description of the light is slightly inaccurate; it's a sliver of light coming from the gap between the door and its frame, not through a \"crack\" in the door itself. Furthermore, the caption should include more specific attributes for the objects on the side table: the lamp is red and ornate with a giraffe silhouette, and the bowl is green. The phrase \"The camera dynamically zooms out\" can be simplified to \"The camera zooms out,\" and the final interpretive clause, \"enhancing the mood and sense of place, with the setting itself as the primary point of interest,\" should be removed as it is subjective and redundant.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video presents an interior shot of a dimly lit room, where the camera zooms out to reveal the full scene. The central focus is a dark wooden door featuring a small, central peephole. The door is slightly ajar, allowing a sliver of light to shine through the gap between it and the frame. To the left of the door, the wall has a light switch and a small, framed picture. Below this, a wooden side table holds a red, ornate lamp with a giraffe silhouette, a small framed photo, and a green bowl. To the right of the door, a larger framed artwork hangs on the wall, and below it, the wooden slats of a piece of furniture, possibly a crib, are visible.",
