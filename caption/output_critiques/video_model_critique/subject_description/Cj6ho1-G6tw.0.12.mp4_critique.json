    "pre_caption": "This is a tranquil cityscape scenery shot capturing a massive, illuminated suspension bridge spanning a wide body of water at dusk. The bridge's long deck is lined with evenly spaced lights, and its towering support structures are also lit, all casting a warm, golden reflection on the calm surface of the water below. In the foreground, the dark, wet silhouette of a rocky or muddy shoreline is visible, while the sky above fades from a deep, dusky orange and blue near the horizon to complete darkness. The video lacks a specific main subject, as the static, wide composition is intended to capture the serene atmosphere and the grand scale of the architectural marvel against the twilight sky. The focus is on the peaceful interplay between the man-made lights and the natural environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on the caption. Here is a detailed breakdown of its performance based on the provided instructions.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the main feature as an illuminated suspension bridge at dusk, spanning a body of water. The descriptions of the lights, their reflections, the dark shoreline in the foreground, and the colors of the twilight sky are all precise and true to the video content.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe description is very complete. It covers all the significant visual elements of the scene. It correctly follows the specific instruction for scenery shots by explaining why there is no single main subject and instead describing the overall environment, atmosphere, and scale.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption adheres to most of the instructions very well, but there is one key area for improvement.\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   It correctly identifies the video as a scenery shot and provides the required explanation for the lack of a main subject.\n    *   It uses a single, coherent paragraph and avoids terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   It describes the visual attributes of the scene (the bridge's lights, the water's reflection, the sky's gradient) with specific, descriptive language.\n    *   The structure is logical, starting with the most prominent element (the bridge) and then describing the surrounding environment.\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The main issue is the violation of the rule: \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption includes several such words:\n        *   \"**tranquil** cityscape\"\n        *   \"**serene** atmosphere\"\n        *   \"**peaceful** interplay\"\n    *   **Subjective Assessment:** The phrase \"**architectural marvel**\" is also a subjective judgment rather than a neutral, objective description.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is excellent in its descriptive accuracy and completeness, and it correctly applies the specific rule for scenery shots. However, its use of subjective and emotional language (\"tranquil,\" \"serene,\" \"peaceful,\" \"architectural marvel\") directly contradicts a key negative constraint in the instructions. To be fully compliant, these subjective terms should be removed and replaced with more neutral, descriptive language.",
