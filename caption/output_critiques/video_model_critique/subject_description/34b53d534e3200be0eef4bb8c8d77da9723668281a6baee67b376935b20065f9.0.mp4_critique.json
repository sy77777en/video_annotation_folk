    "pre_caption": "The video reveals a scene along a path covered with yellow leaves. Initially, the focus is on the leaves and a hedge with small yellow flowers. As the scene unfolds, a woman is shown sitting on the ground, leaning against the hedge. She has medium-length dark hair and is wearing a dark jacket and black pants with white stripes. Nearby, a man is crouching, facing her. He has short hair and is wearing a white shirt and dark pants. He appears to be holding a yellow umbrella, which is partially open. The setting suggests a quiet, outdoor area lined with hedges and a fence, with a red car visible in the distance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the subject is revealed through either subject movement or camera movement.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption inaccurately describes the hedge as being \"covered with yellow leaves that have fallen onto it\"; it is a flowering hedge with yellow flowers, and the ground is covered with fallen petals. The description of the woman's top as a \"dark jacket\" is imprecise; \"dark long-sleeved top\" would be more accurate. The caption omits several key details: the woman is wearing black high heels, and the man in the white shirt is crouching and has a backpack on. The description of the men as \"facing her\" is vague; it should specify that the man in the white shirt is crouching in front of her, appearing to take a photo. The final sentence about the setting is partially redundant and should be removed to improve conciseness.",

As the scene pans out, a woman with medium-length dark hair is seen sitting on the ground, leaning against the hedge. She is wearing a dark, long-sleeved top, black pants with white stripes, and black high heels. A man wearing a white shirt, dark pants, and a backpack is crouching in front of her, appearing to take her photograph. The setting is an outdoor path alongside a chain-link fence, with parked cars visible in the distance.",
