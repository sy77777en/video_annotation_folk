Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption is a good attempt, but it has some issues regarding adherence to the instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description of the video as a \"cityscape scenery shot\" featuring a \"red brick and glass building\" is accurate. The details about the urban environment and surrounding structures are also correct.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption captures the general essence of the video, focusing on the architecture and urban setting.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid subjective adjectives\":** The caption uses the words \"dynamic\" and \"immersive feel.\" These are subjective descriptions of the viewing experience and convey a feeling, which directly violates the instruction to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" You should describe the objective visual elements that *create* this feeling (e.g., the changing camera angle, the upward movement) rather than the feeling itself.\n*   **Inaccuracy regarding the subject:** The caption states the focus is on the environment \"rather than concentrating on a specific object or subject.\" This is not entirely accurate. The red brick building is a very specific and primary object of focus throughout the video. While the video is a scenery shot, the building is the central element that the camera follows and explores. A more accurate description would frame the building as the main subject within the broader cityscape context.\n\n**Feedback Summary:**\n\nThe caption correctly identifies the video's content as a cityscape and accurately describes the main building's appearance. However, it fails to adhere to the instructions by including subjective, emotional language (\"dynamic,\" \"immersive feel\"). Additionally, its claim that the video does not concentrate on a specific object is inaccurate, as the red brick building is the clear focal point. The description should be revised to remove subjective terms and more accurately represent the building's role as the primary subject within the scenery shot.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video features a wide-angle, point-of-view shot that follows the exterior of a tall, red brick and glass residential building. The camera starts with an upward-looking view from a lower level and then ascends along the building's facade. As it moves, the perspective shifts and rotates, showing the building's balconies and windows against a twilight sky. In the background, other city buildings and construction cranes are visible. The shot concludes by looking down the length of the building from a high vantage point.",
