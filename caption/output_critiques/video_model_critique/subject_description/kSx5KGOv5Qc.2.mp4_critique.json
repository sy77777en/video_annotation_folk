    "pre_caption": "This video presents a panoramic cityscape and seascape scenery shot, offering a high-angle, sweeping view of a historic coastal city. The city, distinguished by its dense collection of terracotta-roofed buildings, is entirely enclosed by formidable stone walls and situated on a peninsula that extends into the deep blue sea, with a small, verdant island visible in the background. The shot is taken from a rocky, green hillside in the foreground, which includes part of a cable car structure, enhancing the sense of elevation. There is no main subject, as the composition is designed to capture the grand scale and picturesque atmosphere of the location, focusing on the relationship between the ancient architecture and its stunning natural surroundings rather than any single element.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption uses the subjective adjectives \"formidable,\" \"picturesque,\" and \"stunning,\" which should be replaced with more neutral, descriptive terms to adhere to the instruction to avoid subjective language. For example, \"formidable stone walls\" could be \"high stone walls.\" The term \"sweeping view\" is slightly inaccurate as it can imply camera movement, which is not present in this static shot; \"wide\" or \"expansive\" would be more precise. Additionally, the phrase \"enhancing the sense of elevation\" is an interpretation of the shot's effect and should be removed to maintain objectivity. Finally, the last sentence is slightly wordy and could be condensed for better conciseness.",
