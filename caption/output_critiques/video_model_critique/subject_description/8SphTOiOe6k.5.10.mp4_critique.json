    "pre_caption": "The video features a bustling street scene with various subjects. A red bicycle with a basket is parked next to a vending machine displaying colorful charts. Several people are walking nearby, including a woman in a tan jacket and black shorts, and another person in a white outfit. A group of individuals, some wearing casual dark clothing, are gathered near a traditional storefront with hanging lanterns and signs. The scene captures a lively urban environment with a mix of modern and traditional elements.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects with no clear main focus**. Because it does not emphasize any specific subject, please briefly describe the types of subjects without going into too much detail. You may also describe the subjects collectively as a group.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption includes some relevant details but misses several key visual attributes and contains inaccuracies. It does not mention the prominent display case filled with plastic food models, which is a major subject in the video. The description of the vending machine is incorrect; it is actually a fortune-telling board with colorful charts, not a vending machine. The caption references a group of people and a traditional storefront, but it should specify that there are two women—one in a tan jacket and black shorts, and one in a white shirt dress with a black belt and black boots—both wearing masks, as well as a man in a dark shirt and pants, also masked, and several other casually dressed individuals, some in white shirts. The caption should clarify that the scene transitions from a close-up of the bicycle and fortune-telling board to a wider view of the storefront and people walking by. The mention of a \"bustling street scene\" and \"lively urban environment\" is too general and subjective; the focus should be on the specific subjects and their visual attributes. To improve, the caption should accurately identify the fortune-telling board, describe the display case of food models, provide more precise details about the people and their clothing, and clearly explain the transition in the video.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with a close-up of a red bicycle with a basket parked next to a fortune-telling board adorned with colorful charts. Nearby, a prominent display case filled with plastic food models captures attention. The scene transitions to a wider view, revealing a traditional storefront with hanging lanterns and signs. In front of the storefront, two women wearing masks are visible: one in a tan jacket and black shorts, and the other in a white shirt dress with a black belt and black boots. A masked man in a dark shirt and pants stands nearby, along with several other casually dressed individuals, some in white shirts. The video captures a dynamic urban setting, highlighting the mix of modern and traditional elements through these specific subjects and their visual attributes.",
