    "pre_caption": "The video features a man standing near a row of subway turnstiles. He is wearing a long, dark coat and a hat, with his back turned slightly towards the camera. The man appears to be interacting with the turnstile, possibly preparing to pass through. The setting is a subway station, indicated by the signage for the \"Red Line trains\" above the turnstiles. The lighting is dim, casting shadows around the area.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your instructions, here is detailed feedback on the provided caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption's description of the action is inaccurate. It states the person \"appears to be interacting with the turnstile, possibly preparing to pass through.\" However, the video clearly shows the person successfully walking through the turnstile and disappearing behind it. The action is completed, not just prepared for.\n*   Identifying the subject as a \"man\" is an assumption. Due to the bulky coat, hat/hood, and the person's orientation away from the camera, their gender is not discernible. Using a neutral term like \"person\" would be more accurate.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is incomplete because it omits the most significant action in the video: the person's movement through the turnstile. It describes a static moment at the beginning but fails to capture the brief narrative of entry and disappearance that follows.\n*   While it mentions the dark coat and hat, it omits other visible details like the person's white shoes, which contrast with their dark clothing.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   The caption does not fully \"combine details from the frames\" to describe the subject's action over time. It focuses only on the initial state.\n*   It violates the rule to \"avoid describing what you are unsure about\" by labeling the subject a \"man.\"\n*   Most importantly, it fails to follow the instruction to describe subjects that are \"disappearing\" and to \"describe the transition in detail.\" The person's passage through the turnstile is a key transition that is completely missed.\n*   The description of the setting and lighting is good and follows the instructions well, but the description of the main subject and their action is flawed.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a dimly lit subway station with a greenish tint, a person wearing a long, dark coat and white shoes walks toward a bank of turnstiles. A prominent red sign above reads \"Red Line trains.\" The person approaches the leftmost turnstile, walks through it, and disappears from view behind the gate's structure. The camera then slowly pans right across the empty, stainless steel turnstiles.",
