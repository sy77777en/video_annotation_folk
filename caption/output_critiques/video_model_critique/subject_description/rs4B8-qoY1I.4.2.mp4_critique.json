    "pre_caption": "The video features a pixelated, retro-style scene with a green and black color scheme. A small, humanoid figure with a blocky appearance and a green outfit is visible, moving around a room with brick walls. The figure interacts with a tall stack of blocks and a small table. An archway is present, and a ghostly face appears near it. The scene includes a scroll-like interface at the bottom, displaying numbers and symbols, adding to the vintage game aesthetic.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly states the figure is \"interacting with\" the table; the video only shows the figure stopping next to it. The phrase \"adding to the vintage game aesthetic\" is a subjective interpretation and should be removed. The description of the interface is incomplete; it should mention the specific visible elements, such as the person icon with the number \"04\" on the left and the word \"day\" in the center. Finally, the description of the sun \"becoming visible\" could be more precise by stating that it appears on the left side of its frame before moving to the right.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is a clip from a pixelated, retro video game presented in an isometric view with a green-on-black color scheme. The scene depicts a room with brick-textured walls, an archway, a tall pillar of blocks with a chest at its base, and a small table. A small, green humanoid figure walks from the left side of the screen, past the pillar, and stops next to the table on the right. The interface at the bottom of the screen is framed by green scrolls. On the left, a person icon is shown next to the number \"04\". The word \"day\" is in the center. On the right, inside a red-bordered frame, a yellow sun icon appears on the left side and then moves to the right.",
