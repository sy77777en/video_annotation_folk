    "pre_caption": "The video depicts a dimly lit urban street scene with multiple subjects. Two people, both wearing dark clothing and hooded jackets, walk along the wet sidewalk. One person is slightly ahead, while the other follows closely behind. The street is lined with buildings featuring illuminated signs, including a recognizable fast-food logo and a pub sign. A few pigeons are visible on the ground, adding to the urban atmosphere. The overall scene conveys a typical city street with pedestrians and ambient lighting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects with no clear main focus**. Because it does not emphasize any specific subject, please briefly describe the types of subjects without going into too much detail. You may also describe the subjects collectively as a group.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption provides a decent general overview of the scene's atmosphere but fails on several key instructions, particularly regarding the accurate and complete description of the main subjects and their actions over time. It misrepresents the number of people and the sequence of events, which are crucial details.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\n\n*   **Inaccurate Subject Count and Action:** The caption states, \"Two people, both wearing dark clothing and hooded jackets, walk along the wet sidewalk.\" This is incorrect. The video begins with a single person walking away from the camera, carrying a closed umbrella. A few seconds later, two other people in dark, hooded jackets enter the frame from the left and walk in the same direction. The caption conflates these three individuals into two and misses the initial action.\n*   **Misleading Relationship:** The sentence \"One person is slightly ahead, while the other follows closely behind\" accurately describes the two people who enter later, but it completely ignores the first person who is much further ahead of both of them. This creates a misleading picture of the scene's composition.\n\n**Completeness:**\n\n*   **Omission of the Main Subject:** The caption completely omits the first person who is the central focus at the start of the video and remains visible throughout. This is a significant omission.\n*   **Missing Key Object:** It fails to mention the closed umbrella being carried by the first person, which is a distinct visual attribute.\n*   **Order of Appearance:** The description does not follow the temporal order of events. The instruction states, \"If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear.\" The caption fails to do this, instead presenting a static, and incorrect, summary.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Subject Description:** The caption fails to \"clearly identify each subject\" and \"distinguish them using unique appearance traits... or actions.\" It groups three distinct subjects into a single, inaccurate description of two.\n*   **Subjective Language:** The phrase \"adding to the urban atmosphere\" is a minor violation of the rule to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" While not strongly emotional, it is an interpretation of the pigeons' role in the scene rather than a direct visual description. A more neutral description would simply state their presence.\n*   **Conciseness vs. Information:** While the caption is concise, it sacrifices essential information and accuracy to achieve that brevity, failing the \"informative\" part of the instruction.\n*   **Positive Adherence:** The caption correctly uses a single paragraph, avoids meta-terms like \"video\" or \"frame\" (after the first sentence), and correctly identifies the setting as an urban street with illuminated signs.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is **not good** because it is factually inaccurate and incomplete regarding the primary subjects. It fails to follow the crucial instruction to describe subjects as they appear and to distinguish between them, leading to a description that does not match the visual evidence in the video.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "On a dimly lit, wet city street, a person in a dark jacket walks away from the camera down the sidewalk, carrying a closed umbrella. The street is lined with buildings, including a McDonald's and a bar with a glowing red sign for \"MILLER'S PUB\". A moment later, two more people wearing dark, hooded jackets enter from the left and proceed in the same direction. A few pigeons are visible on the wet pavement, which reflects the glow from streetlights and building signs.",
