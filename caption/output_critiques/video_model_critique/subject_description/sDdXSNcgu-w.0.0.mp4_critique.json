    "pre_caption": "A sequence of simple, black-and-white line drawings appears against a plain white background. The first is a stylized human figure with a round head, slanted eyebrows, and a straight mouth, giving it an angry expression. This is followed by a drawing of a sitting cat with pointed ears and a small smile. Next, a character resembling a crewmate from the game *Among Us* is shown, with its characteristic bean-like shape and large oval visor. Subsequently, a cartoonish Tyrannosaurus Rex appears, depicted with a large head, sharp teeth, and small arms. This is followed by a drawing of a short, grinning skeleton wearing a hooded jacket with its hands in the pockets. After that, a small, cloaked figure with a horned head and large, black, circular eyes is displayed. Then, a flower with a wide, sinister grin and black eyes in its center is shown. The final distinct character is a plant-like creature with a large, toothed mouth and wide eyes.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption omits two distinct character transformations. After the Tyrannosaurus Rex, a second, smoother dinosaur-like creature with a smiling expression appears before transforming into the skeleton. Additionally, after the skeleton appears, it briefly transforms into a winking version of itself with a glowing eye and a horn-like tuft of hair before changing into the cloaked figure. The description of the final transformation where the plant-like creature \"splits apart and then reassembles\" is inaccurate; it simply morphs back into the human figure. To improve conciseness, the redundant description of the initial human figure at the end of the caption should be removed. For greater precision and consistency with the identification of the *Among Us* character, the caption should also identify the other characters by their common names and game origins, such as the skeleton as Sans from *Undertale*, the cloaked figure as The Knight from *Hollow Knight*, the flower as Flowey from *Undertale*, and the plant-like creature as a Piranha Plant from the *Mario* series.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A sequence of simple, black-and-white line drawings appears against a plain white background, continuously morphing from one character to the next. The first is a stylized human figure with an angry expression. This figure transforms into a sitting cat, which then becomes a crewmate from the game *Among Us*. The crewmate morphs into a cartoonish Tyrannosaurus Rex, which then smooths into a different, smiling dinosaur-like creature. This creature changes into Sans from the game *Undertale*, a short, grinning skeleton in a hooded jacket. Sans briefly winks with a glowing eye and sprouts a horn-like tuft of hair before transforming into The Knight from the game *Hollow Knight*. The Knight then becomes Flowey from *Undertale*, a flower with a sinister grin. Next, Flowey morphs into a Piranha Plant from the *Mario* series. Finally, the Piranha Plant transforms back into the initial angry human figure, completing the loop.",
