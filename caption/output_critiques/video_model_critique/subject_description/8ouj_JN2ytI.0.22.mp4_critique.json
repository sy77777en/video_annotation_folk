    "pre_caption": "On a green football field, a player in a black jersey with yellow details, yellow pants, and a yellow helmet runs with a football. Another player, wearing a yellow jersey with black details, black pants, and a black helmet, runs nearby. A referee in a black and white striped shirt and black pants stands observing. Several other players in blue and white uniforms are also on the field, some involved in a tackle. A large crowd, mostly in yellow attire, fills the background stands.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

Here is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the criteria:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the main subject as a football player running with the ball and accurately describes his uniform (black jersey with yellow details, yellow pants, yellow helmet).\n*   It correctly describes the second player's inverted uniform (yellow jersey, black pants, black helmet).\n*   The description of the referee's attire and the opposing players' blue and white uniforms is also precise.\n*   The observation that the crowd is large and mostly wearing yellow is correct.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is very complete. It captures all the salient subjects and actions within the short video clip: the ball carrier, his teammate running alongside, the observing referee, the other players engaged in a tackle, and the crowd in the stands.\n*   It provides enough detail on the visual attributes of each subject (especially their clothing) to clearly distinguish them.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The description is a single, clear, and coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It uses precise terms like \"player\" and \"referee\" and distinguishes between them effectively using their clothing and actions.\n*   **Visual Attributes:** It provides specific details about clothing color and style for all human subjects, as instructed.\n*   **Focus:** It correctly focuses on the salient subjects (the players) while briefly mentioning the background (the crowd) for context, which is appropriate.\n*   **Objectivity:** The caption avoids subjective adjectives and speculation, describing only what is visually present.\n*   **Structure:** It correctly prioritizes the most central action (the player running with the ball) before describing other elements on the field and in the background.\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single paragraph with no introductory text or markdown, as required.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is a perfect example of what was requested. It is accurate, comprehensive, and strictly adheres to all the detailed instructions provided. There are no necessary improvements.",
