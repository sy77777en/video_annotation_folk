    "pre_caption": "The video initially focuses on a wine cabinet in the background, filled with various bottles arranged on shelves. As the focus shifts to the foreground, it reveals half of a wine glass containing light blue wine on the left side. Next to the glass, there is a white-grey colored food item, likely cheese, placed in the middle. The scene transitions from the detailed view of the wine cabinet to highlighting the wine glass and cheese, emphasizing the change in focus from background to foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Clearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nKeep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Only mention the background or motion if necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. Avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. Use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. Avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Return only the description.\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video begins with the wine cabinet in focus in the background. A rack focus then shifts the attention to the foreground, revealing half of a wine glass with light blue wine on the left and a white-grey colored food item, possibly cheese, in the middle.**",

  "generated_critique": "### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe caption is excellent. It is accurate, well-structured, and adheres closely to all the provided instructions. It effectively captures the essence of the video, which is the transition of focus from a background element to foreground subjects.\n\n**Detailed Breakdown:**\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the initial subject (wine cabinet), the subsequent subjects (wine glass, food item), their key attributes (light blue wine, white-grey color), and their placement. The description of the video's primary action—the focus shift—is also precise.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is comprehensive. It covers all the salient subjects and the dynamic change that occurs. The use of \"likely cheese\" is a perfect example of how to handle ambiguity without making definitive but unproven claims, which aligns perfectly with the instructions.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is concise while providing enough detail to be informative. The language is simple and natural.\n    *   **Subject Identification:** It uses precise terms like \"wine cabinet\" and \"wine glass\" and appropriately qualifies the \"food item.\"\n    *   **Describing Transitions:** The caption excels at describing the focus pull. Phrases like \"initially focuses on,\" \"As the focus shifts,\" and \"The scene transitions from... to...\" clearly explain the video's progression without referring to specific frames.\n    *   **Avoiding Speculation:** The use of \"likely cheese\" is a model example of following this rule.\n    *   **Structure and Flow:** The paragraph is a single, coherent unit that follows the temporal flow of the video, starting with the initial view and moving to the final one.\n\n**Suggestion for Minor Improvement:**\nThe final sentence (\"The scene transitions from the detailed view...\") is slightly redundant because the preceding sentence (\"As the focus shifts...\") has already described the transition. While it effectively summarizes the action, the caption could be made even more concise by integrating this summary or removing it.\n\n**Example of a slightly more concise version:**\n\n\"The video initially focuses on a tall wine cabinet in the background, filled with bottles on its shelves. The focus then shifts to the foreground, revealing a partial view of a glass containing a light blue liquid on the left, and a white-grey, crumbly food item, likely cheese, on a dark surface next to it.\"\n\nThis alternative is not necessarily better, but it demonstrates how the same information can be conveyed with slightly fewer words. However, your original caption's explicit summary is also a valid and clear way to describe the action.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nYour caption is very well-written and serves as a great example of how to follow the given instructions. It is ready to be used as is.",
