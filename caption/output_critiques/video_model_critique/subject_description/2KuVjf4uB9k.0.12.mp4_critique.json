    "pre_caption": "The video features a black sports car with prominent branding, including \"Royal Purple\" and \"Achilles\" on its body. The car is engaged in a drifting maneuver on a paved track, producing a significant amount of white smoke from its rear tires. The car's sleek design and dynamic motion are highlighted as it navigates a curved section of the track, showcasing its agility and power. The setting appears to be an open, arid landscape, enhancing the focus on the car's performance and the dramatic effect of the drifting action.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is good. It accurately and clearly identifies the main subject and its primary action. However, it violates a key instruction by including subjective and interpretive language.\n\n**Feedback Breakdown:**\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subject as a \"black sports car,\" notes the visible branding (\"Royal Purple,\" \"Achilles\"), and accurately describes the action of drifting on a paved track while producing white smoke. The description of the setting as an \"open, arid landscape\" is also correct.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is complete. It focuses on the single, salient subject (the car) and its action, which is the entire point of the video. It appropriately omits minor, out-of-focus details like the distant people on the hill.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Strengths:**\n        *   The caption is a concise, single paragraph.\n        *   It correctly identifies the subject type (\"sports car\").\n        *   It describes key visual attributes (color, branding).\n        *   It describes the subject's action (\"drifting maneuver\").\n        *   It avoids terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n\n    *   **Areas for Improvement:**\n        *   **Violation of \"No Subjective Adjectives\":** The primary issue with the caption is its use of subjective and interpretive language. The instructions state, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\"\n            *   \"**sleek** design\": \"Sleek\" is a subjective term related to aesthetics. A more objective description would focus on the car's form, such as \"a low-profile black sports coupe.\"\n            *   \"showcasing its **agility** and **power**\": \"Agility\" and \"power\" are inferred qualities, not directly visible attributes. The description should state the observable action, such as \"The car turns sharply at speed,\" rather than interpreting the performance characteristics it implies.\n            *   \"**dramatic** effect\": \"Dramatic\" describes an emotional impact and is subjective. The description should stick to the facts, such as \"producing a large cloud of white smoke.\"\n        *   **Interpretation vs. Description:** The final sentence, \"...enhancing the focus on the car's performance and the dramatic effect of the drifting action,\" analyzes the compositional effect rather than simply describing the scene. The instructions ask for a description of what is visible, not an interpretation of the filmmaker's intent or the scene's impact.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption successfully describes the factual content of the video but fails to adhere strictly to the rule against subjectivity. To be fully compliant, it should be revised to remove interpretive words like \"sleek,\" \"agility,\" \"power,\" and \"dramatic,\" and focus purely on objective, observable details.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A black sports coupe, with \"Royal Purple\" and \"Achilles\" branding visible on its side, performs a drifting maneuver on a paved track. As the car slides sideways through a wide turn, its rear tires generate a large cloud of white smoke. The scene takes place on a racetrack in an open, arid landscape with low hills in the background.",
