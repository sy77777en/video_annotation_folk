    "pre_caption": "In a very dark, blue-lit scene, the face of a light-skinned woman is shown in a close-up. Her head is tilted, resting on a surface, and she looks upward with wide, dark eyes. Her expression is tense, with a slight frown and her mouth slightly open. Her hair is dark and partially visible around her face.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is excellent feedback. The caption is well-written and captures the essence of the video, but there's one specific point where it deviates from the instructions.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subject as a light-skinned woman in a close-up, the dark and blue-lit environment, her tilted head position, her upward gaze with wide eyes, and the specific details of her facial features (slight frown, open mouth, dark hair).\n\n**Completeness:** The description is very complete, covering all the salient visual information available in the dark scene. It effectively describes the subject's pose, key facial attributes, and the overall lighting without speculating on details that are obscured by shadow.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres to almost all instructions perfectly. It is a concise, single paragraph, uses simple language, avoids forbidden terms, and focuses on the primary subject. However, it violates one specific rule:\n\n*   **Violation:** The instruction states, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption uses the word **\"tense\"** to describe her expression. While this is an accurate interpretation of her look, \"tense\" is a subjective term describing an emotional or physical state. The caption does a great job of following this up with objective descriptions (\"a slight frown and her mouth slightly open\"), which are the correct way to convey the visual information without interpretation. To be fully compliant, the word \"tense\" should be removed.\n\n**Overall Assessment:** The caption is very good but could be perfected by removing the single subjective adjective to fully align with the provided guidelines.",
