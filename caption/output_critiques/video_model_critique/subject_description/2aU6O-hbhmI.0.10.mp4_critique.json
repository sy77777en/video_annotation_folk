    "pre_caption": "The video is an urban cityscape scenery shot. It captures the dynamic and expansive view of a construction site within a city environment. The focus is on the scale and complexity of the urban landscape, highlighting the intricate network of cranes, buildings, and construction materials. The sweeping angles and vibrant colors emphasize the bustling atmosphere and the ongoing development, rather than concentrating on a specific object or subject. The emphasis is on the environment and the sense of movement and progress within the city.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

    "initial_feedback": "I would say that the camera focuses on the crane in the center of the frame, instead of \"the scale and complexity of the urban landscape\". And I would not say \"sense of movement\" because there is no moving subject in the shot.",
    "gpt_feedback": "The camera primarily focuses on the crane positioned at the center of the frame, rather than on the overall scale and complexity of the urban landscape. Additionally, I would not describe the video as conveying a \"sense of movement,\" as there is no moving subject within the shot.",

The vibrant colors emphasize the bustling atmosphere and ongoing development, with an emphasis on the environment rather than a specific moving subject.",
    "gpt_caption_prompt": "Given a video caption and user feedback, please provide an improved version of the caption that addresses the feedback.

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly describes the video as capturing \"intricate details,\" which is inaccurate due to the rapid, blurry motion. It also uses the subjective phrase \"bustling atmosphere,\" which should be avoided. The most significant omission is the failure to describe the video's defining characteristic: a fast-paced, spinning, first-person-view dive over the scene. The description of a \"central focus on a crane\" is also misleading, as the focus is on the overall dynamic movement through the environment. The caption should be revised to describe the video as a fast-paced aerial or point-of-view shot of an urban construction site at sunset or sunrise, mentioning the rapid diving and spinning motion. It should objectively note the presence of multiple cranes and buildings against a colorful sky, and state that the focus is on the dynamic perspective of the environment rather than a specific subject.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This fast-paced, first-person-view video captures a rapid, spinning dive over an urban construction site at sunset or sunrise. From a dynamic aerial perspective, the camera plunges downwards, revealing multiple cranes and buildings against a colorful sky. The focus is on the thrilling sense of movement and the unique point-of-view through the environment, rather than on a specific subject.",
