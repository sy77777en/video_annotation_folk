The focus is on the scale and complexity of the urban landscape, highlighting the intricate network of cranes, buildings, and construction materials. The sweeping angles and vibrant colors emphasize the bustling atmosphere and the ongoing development, rather than concentrating on a specific object or subject. The emphasis is on the environment and the sense of movement and progress within the city.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

It successfully explains *why* there is no main subject, as per the instructions, by stating that the focus is on the \"scale and complexity of the urban landscape\" and the \"sense of movement and progress.\"\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Scenery Shot Protocol:** The caption flawlessly follows the specific instructions for scenery shots. It identifies the type of scenery and provides a clear, concise explanation for the absence of a salient subject.\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The language is simple, natural, and clear.
