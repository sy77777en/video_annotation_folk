    "pre_caption": "The video features an abstract scene with numerous circular light patterns resembling bokeh effects. These circles vary in size and intensity, displaying warm hues of gold, orange, and yellow. The lights are scattered across the frame, creating a sense of depth and movement. The overall composition is dynamic, with the glowing circles appearing to float and overlap, contributing to a visually rich and textured appearance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "**Feedback on the Caption:**\n\nThe provided caption is excellent and adheres to all the instructions.\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the visual elements as \"circular light patterns resembling bokeh effects\" and accurately describes their attributes, including their varying sizes, intensity, and warm colors (gold, orange, yellow). The mention of depth, movement, and overlapping is also a precise observation of the video's content.\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is comprehensive. It covers all the essential visual information without being overly detailed. It successfully captures the abstract and dynamic nature of the scene.\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **No Salient Subject:** The caption correctly follows the guideline for scenery/abstract shots by describing the overall scene and its atmospheric qualities rather than focusing on a non-existent main subject.\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The description is a single, coherent paragraph written in clear, simple English.\n    *   **Objectivity:** It avoids subjective, emotional language and uses descriptive terms like \"dynamic,\" \"warm hues,\" and \"visually rich\" in an objective, technical sense.\n    *   **Visual Attributes:** It effectively details the key visual attributes of the light patterns (color, size, intensity, arrangement).\n    *   **Formatting:** It avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame\" and is presented as a single paragraph without extra formatting.\n\nThe caption is a model example of how to describe an abstract video according to the given rules.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This abstract video showcases a dynamic display of circular light patterns, reminiscent of bokeh. Varying in size and intensity, these glowing orbs float and overlap in warm hues of gold, orange, and yellow. Scattered across the dark background, the lights create a sense of depth and a visually rich, textured appearance.",
