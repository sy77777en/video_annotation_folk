    "pre_caption": "The video is a nighttime cityscape scenery shot, featuring a quiet, empty road illuminated by a series of evenly spaced streetlights that cast pools of light onto the pavement and sidewalk. The darkness of the sky and the absence of vehicles or pedestrians emphasize the stillness and solitude of the urban environment, while the gentle curve of the road and the subtle glow from the lamps create a sense of depth and calm. There is no main subject in this video, as the focus is on capturing the tranquil atmosphere and expansive emptiness of the city at night rather than highlighting any specific object or individual.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption violates the instruction to avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions by using the words \"quiet,\" \"stillness,\" \"solitude,\" \"calm,\" and \"tranquil.\" These terms describe the atmosphere and feeling of the scene rather than its objective visual characteristics. The description should be revised to focus only on what is visually present. For example, instead of mentioning \"stillness and solitude,\" the caption should state the \"absence of vehicles or pedestrians.\" Additionally, the instruction for scenery shots calls for a concise explanation of why there is no main subject. The current paragraph is slightly long; it could be condensed by integrating the explanation more directly into the description of the scene rather than stating it as a separate, concluding thought.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is a nighttime scenery shot of an empty road illuminated by a series of streetlights that cast pools of light onto the pavement and sidewalk. The sky is dark, and there is an absence of vehicles or pedestrians. The shot lacks a specific main subject, as the focus is on the overall composition of the illuminated, curving road within the dark, unoccupied urban environment.",
