    "pre_caption": "The video features a woman with curly brown hair, wearing a beige coat, holding a fluffy, light brown dog. The dog has a blue patterned bandana around its neck. The woman is seen from different angles, with her hair partially tied back. In the background, two men are visible; one is wearing a white shirt and jeans, and the other is in a green jacket and jeans. They appear to be engaged in conversation. The setting includes outdoor seating and greenery, suggesting a casual, outdoor environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of your caption:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy: Good**\n*   The description of the main subjects—the woman with curly brown hair in a beige coat and the fluffy, light brown dog—is accurate.\n*   The detail about the dog's \"blue patterned bandana\" is correct.\n*   The description of the first man in the background (\"white shirt and jeans\") is accurate.\n*   **Correction:** The description of the second man is inaccurate. He is wearing a green jacket, but his pants are reddish or burgundy, not jeans.\n\n**Completeness: Good**\n*   The caption successfully identifies and describes the primary subject (the woman and dog) and the secondary subjects (the two men).\n*   It includes key visual attributes like clothing color, hair, and accessories (the bandana).\n*   **Minor Omission:** You could have mentioned the small clip holding the woman's hair back, but its absence doesn't significantly detract from the description.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions: Needs Improvement**\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   The caption is a single, coherent paragraph.\n    *   It correctly prioritizes the main subject (the woman and dog) before moving to the background subjects.\n    *   It uses precise subject types (\"woman,\" \"dog,\" \"men\").\n    *   It avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   **Describing the Background:** The instruction states, \"Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects.\" The final sentence, \"The setting includes outdoor seating and greenery, suggesting a casual, outdoor environment,\" violates this rule as this information is not needed to describe the subjects themselves.\n    *   **Avoiding Subjectivity and Inference:** The phrase \"suggesting a casual, outdoor environment\" is an interpretation of the atmosphere, not a direct description of a subject. The instruction is to \"avoid subjective adjectives\" and \"describing what you are unsure about.\" Similarly, \"They appear to be engaged in conversation\" is an inference about their action. A more compliant description would focus on their observable posture, such as \"standing near each other.\"\n    *   **Conciseness:** The phrase \"The video features...\" is unnecessary introductory text. The instructions ask for the description itself, which should start directly with the subject (e.g., \"A woman with...\").\n\n### Revised Caption Example\n\nHere is an example of a revised caption that more closely follows all instructions:\n\nA woman with curly brown hair partially tied back walks while holding a fluffy, light brown dog over her shoulder. The woman wears a beige coat, and the dog has a white bandana with a blue and red pattern around its neck. In the background, two men stand; one wears a white shirt and blue jeans, while the other wears a green jacket and reddish pants.",
