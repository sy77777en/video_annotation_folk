    "pre_caption": "This is a forest scenery shot depicting a paved, two-lane road curving through a dense redwood forest. Massive, ancient redwood trees with thick, dark trunks tower over the scene, their immense scale creating a cathedral-like atmosphere as sunlight filters through the high canopy, casting bright patches and deep shadows across the road and the lush green undergrowth. A dark-colored sedan drives along the road, its presence highlighting the vastness of the surrounding trees. There is no single main subject, as the focus is on capturing the majestic and immersive atmosphere of the ancient forest. The composition emphasizes the scale of the natural environment rather than any specific object within it. The car acts as a point of reference, underscoring the grandeur of the landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is overly long and contains redundant information. The final three sentences (\"There is no single main subject... The composition emphasizes... The car acts as a point of reference...\") are repetitive and should be condensed into a single sentence to adhere to the instruction to \"briefly explain why there is no main subject... using one to three sentences.\" The caption also omits a distinct object: a yellow and black striped hazard marker sign on the right side of the road next to a large tree. Finally, the use of subjective words like \"majestic\" and \"grandeur\" should be avoided. The description should be revised to include the sign and condense the repetitive explanation at the end.",

Tall redwood trees with thick, dark trunks tower over the scene as sunlight filters through the high canopy, casting bright patches and deep shadows across the road and the lush green undergrowth. A dark-colored sedan drives along the road. On the right, a yellow and black striped hazard marker is posted next to a large tree. There is no single main subject; instead, the composition uses the car as a point of reference to emphasize the scale of the surrounding forest.",
