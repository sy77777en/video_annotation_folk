    "pre_caption": "The video features a person standing confidently on a wooden ramp in an indoor setting. This individual has short, light-colored hair and is wearing a light-colored tank top and pants, suggesting a casual style. The person appears to be focused and poised, with a relaxed posture. Surrounding them are various skateboards mounted on the wall, adding a dynamic and sporty atmosphere to the scene. The lighting casts distinct shadows, enhancing the visual depth and highlighting the person's presence in the space.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.",

  "generated_critique": "An evaluation of the provided caption is as follows:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe description is factually accurate. The video does show a person with short, light-colored hair in a tank top and pants, standing on a wooden ramp indoors. The presence of skateboards on the wall and the distinct shadows from the lighting are also correctly identified.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption successfully identifies the main subject and the most relevant objects in their immediate vicinity (the ramp and skateboards). However, it omits a few noticeable details, such as the bright blue neon sign on the wall that reads \"BRING ON THE NIGHT\" and the large, out-of-focus green object in the immediate foreground. While not the main focus, the neon sign is a significant visual element that contributes to the scene's character.\n\n**Adherence to the Given Instruction:**\nThe caption fails to adhere to several key instructions, primarily regarding objectivity.\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions\":** The caption uses multiple subjective and interpretive words. Phrases like \"standing confidently,\" \"appears to be focused and poised,\" and \"relaxed posture\" describe the person's internal state or mood, which cannot be known from the visual information alone.\n*   **Violation of describing the scene's \"atmosphere\":** The phrase \"adding a dynamic and sporty atmosphere to the scene\" is a subjective interpretation of the mood, which goes against the instruction to stick to objective visual facts.\n*   **Interpretive Language:** The statement \"The lighting casts distinct shadows, enhancing the visual depth and highlighting the person's presence in the space\" moves from description to analysis. While the lighting does cast shadows, describing its effect as \"enhancing\" or \"highlighting\" is an interpretation of the cinematographer's intent rather than a direct description of what is visible. A more compliant description would be \"Strong light from above casts long shadows across the ramp.\"\n\nIn summary, while the caption is factually accurate and describes the main subject, it heavily relies on subjective and interpretive language, which directly violates the core instructions to remain objective and avoid describing emotions or atmosphere. It also misses a prominent visual detail in the neon sign.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a dimly lit, industrial-style room, a person with short, light-colored hair stands on a wooden ramp. They are wearing a light-colored tank top and pants. To the left, a blue neon sign on the wall reads \"BRING ON THE NIGHT\". Behind the person, several skateboards are mounted on the wall. Light from a grated ceiling casts long shadows across the scene, including the shadow of the person on the ramp. In the immediate foreground, a large, out-of-focus green object is visible on the right side of the frame.",
