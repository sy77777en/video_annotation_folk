    "pre_caption": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing a vibrant urban environment. The focus is on the bustling street lined with modern buildings, showcasing a mix of architectural styles. The scene includes a variety of elements such as trees, street signs, and vehicles, contributing to the dynamic atmosphere. The presence of pedestrians and moving cars adds to the lively city vibe. The emphasis is on the overall environment and the interaction of urban elements, rather than a specific object, highlighting the scale and energy of city life.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption generally captures the cityscape focus and the presence of urban elements, but it misses key requirements from the instruction. The video features several salient human subjects: a man in a white t-shirt and dark pants walking while holding a phone to his ear, a woman with light skin and dark hair holding a white umbrella and wearing a light brown top and khaki pants, and a construction worker in a blue shirt and white helmet standing near a building. These individuals should be described with their visual attributes and actions, as they are clearly visible and identifiable. The caption should also specify the types and colors of vehicles (such as white trucks and cars) and note the presence of construction activity. The current caption is too general, lacks specific subject descriptions, and uses subjective terms like \"vibrant\" and \"dynamic,\" which should be avoided. To improve, the caption should concisely describe each visible person and their key attributes, as well as the types of vehicles and any notable objects, while omitting unnecessary adjectives and focusing on clear, factual details.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a bustling urban street scene with a focus on several identifiable human subjects. A man in a white t-shirt and dark pants is seen walking while holding a phone to his ear. Nearby, a woman with light skin and dark hair holds a white umbrella and wears a light brown top with khaki pants. A construction worker in a blue shirt and white helmet stands near a building, indicating ongoing construction activity. The street is lined with modern buildings and features various vehicles, including white trucks and cars. The presence of pedestrians and moving cars contributes to the lively atmosphere, highlighting the interaction of urban elements.",
