    "pre_caption": "This is a cityscape scenery shot, looking down a narrow, empty street flanked by towering buildings. On the left, an older, light-colored building with classical architectural details and numerous windows stretches into the distance. On the right, a modern structure with a reflective glass and steel facade dominates the view. The perspective suggests the camera is moving upwards, possibly from within an elevator or on an escalator, as evidenced by the visible reflections on the glass through which the scene is viewed. There is no main subject; instead, the focus is on the urban environment, the contrasting architectural styles, the imposing scale of the buildings, and the atmosphere of a quiet city canyon.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

This detail should be added to the beginning of the description to accurately represent the shot's composition.",

On the left, an older, light-colored building with classical architectural details stretches into the distance, while a modern structure with a reflective glass and steel facade dominates the right side. The perspective suggests an upward movement, as if from an elevator or escalator, with reflections visible on the glass.
