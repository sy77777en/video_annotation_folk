    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dynamic landscape scenery shot, flying low and fast across the surface of a vibrant, turquoise glacial lake. In the background, a massive, rugged mountain rises steeply, its lower slopes a mix of brown and purplish rock, while its peaks are crowned with a thick, white glacier under a clear, deep blue sky. Thin waterfalls of meltwater cascade down the rocky face from the glacier's edge, feeding the lake below. The shot lacks a single main subject, as its purpose is to immerse the viewer in the vast, pristine, and powerful alpine environment. The focus is on capturing the majestic scale and raw beauty of the natural scene rather than highlighting a specific person or object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption violates the instruction to avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions by using words like \"dynamic,\" \"vibrant,\" \"massive,\" \"rugged,\" \"majestic,\" \"pristine,\" \"powerful,\" and \"raw beauty.\" The final two sentences, which explain the lack of a main subject, are also redundant and overly long. The instruction asks for a brief, one-to-three-sentence explanation, and this could be accomplished more concisely. For example, the explanation could be condensed into a single, more direct sentence like, \"The shot lacks a main subject, focusing instead on the scale of the alpine environment.\" Furthermore, the caption could be more specific by mentioning the brown scree slope along the left shoreline of the lake.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This low, fast-moving aerial shot flies over a turquoise glacial lake toward a large, rocky mountain topped with a glacier. A brown scree slope is visible on the left shoreline, and meltwater waterfalls run down the mountain face. The shot lacks a main subject, focusing instead on the scale of the alpine environment.",
