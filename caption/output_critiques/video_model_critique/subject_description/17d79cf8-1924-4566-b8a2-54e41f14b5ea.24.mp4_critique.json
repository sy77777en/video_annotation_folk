    "pre_caption": "The video features a person engaged in bricklaying. The individual, whose arms and hands are visible, wears a light-colored long-sleeve shirt and patterned shorts. They are handling bricks, which are reddish-brown and rectangular, and are seen placing them on a partially constructed wall. The person is also wearing sandals. A trowel is visible, suggesting they are applying mortar to secure the bricks. The scene is viewed from an overhead perspective, focusing on the construction process.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good for this video.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the main subject as a \"person engaged in bricklaying.\" All the described visual details are present in the video: the light-colored shirt, patterned shorts, sandals, reddish-brown rectangular bricks, a partially constructed wall, and a trowel. The description of the action—handling and placing bricks—is also correct.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption effectively captures the most essential information. It focuses on the primary subject and their activity, which is the central theme of the video. It includes key objects directly involved in the action (bricks, trowel, wall) and relevant details about the subject's appearance (clothing, visible body parts). It also correctly notes the unique \"overhead perspective,\" which is a significant visual characteristic of the video.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption successfully follows all the given instructions:\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a clear and succinct summary of the video's content without unnecessary words.\n*   **Subject-focused:** It centers on the person and the objects they are interacting with.\n*   **No Speculation:** It describes only what is visible. The phrase \"suggesting they are applying mortar\" is a reasonable and direct inference based on the presence of a trowel in a bricklaying context, which is acceptable.\n*   **Proper Language:** It uses simple, natural English and avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **Precise Terminology:** It uses specific subject types like \"person\" and \"bricks.\"\n*   **Detailed Attributes:** It describes the color and style of clothing, as well as the color and shape of the bricks.\n*   **Focus:** It correctly prioritizes the main subject and their action, providing a clear and logical description.",
