    "pre_caption": "The video features a bird with dark plumage flying low over a calm body of water. The bird's wings are outstretched, and it appears to be in motion, skimming the surface. The water is reflective, with small ripples and scattered light debris visible. In the background, a fallen tree trunk lies along the water's edge, partially submerged, with some greenery visible beyond it. The bird's movement creates a subtle disturbance in the water, leaving a trail of ripples behind.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on this caption. It is well-written and adheres to most of the instructions. Here is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies a dark bird flying low over water, the reflective quality of the water, and the fallen tree in the background.\n*   The description of the bird's action as \"skimming the surface\" and creating a \"subtle disturbance\" is generally correct, but it understates the key event in the video. The bird doesn't just skim; it actively dips into the water, creating a very distinct splash before flying out again.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The description covers all the key visual elements: the primary subject (bird), its action, the immediate environment (water), and the background (shoreline with a log).\n*   However, it could be more complete by describing the most dynamic part of the action more precisely—the splash. The current description focuses more on the general state of flying low rather than the specific interaction with the water that is the focal point of the clip.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   The caption is a single, coherent paragraph.\n    *   It uses simple, natural English and avoids subjective or emotional language.\n    *   It correctly avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   It accurately identifies the subject types (\"bird,\" \"tree trunk\").\n    *   It correctly prioritizes the main subject (the bird) before describing the background elements.\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   The description of the action could be more specific. The instruction asks to combine details from the frames, and the most significant detail is the bird dipping into the water and splashing, not just \"skimming.\" A more dynamic description would better capture the essence of the video.\n    *   The phrase \"it appears to be in motion\" is redundant, as \"flying\" and \"skimming\" already imply motion. The instructions call for conciseness, and removing this would strengthen the caption.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is very good but could be improved by being more specific and dynamic in its description of the bird's action. While it accurately describes the scene, it misses the opportunity to capture the most engaging moment—the splash—which is the central event of the video.\n\n**Example of a more dynamic description:**\n\n\"A bird with dark plumage flies low across a calm body of water, dipping down to hit the surface and create a prominent splash before continuing its flight. Small ripples and light debris are visible on the reflective water. In the blurry background, a large, fallen tree trunk rests on the shore.\"",
