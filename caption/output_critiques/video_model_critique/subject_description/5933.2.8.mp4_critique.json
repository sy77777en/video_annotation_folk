    "pre_caption": "The video reveals a person standing in a field of tall, dry grass. The individual is wearing a brown jacket and beige pants, complemented by dark green rubber boots. The person is facing away, with their lower body visible among the dense grass, which is a prominent feature throughout the scene. The video begins with an obscured view, gradually revealing the subject as the camera or subject moves, focusing on the interaction between the person and the natural environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the subject is revealed through either subject movement or camera movement.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption is well-structured and captures the overall mood and composition of the scene. However, there are a few key areas where it can be improved for accuracy and adherence to the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed feedback on your caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **Action:** The caption states the person is \"standing,\" but the video clearly shows them walking forward. Their legs and feet are in motion, lifting and moving through the grass. This is a critical detail of the subject's action that has been misidentified.\n*   **Visible Details:** You mention the person is wearing a \"brown jacket.\" However, the video only shows the person from the knees down. The jacket is not visible, and describing it violates the instruction: \"You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\"\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption does a good job of describing the visible clothing (pants, boots) and the environment (tall, dry grass).\n*   It successfully notes the \"reveal\" aspect of the shot, starting from an obscured view.\n*   It misses the low-angle perspective of the shot, which is a significant stylistic choice that emphasizes the person's movement through the dense grass.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Positives:** The caption correctly avoids subjective language, uses a single paragraph, and focuses on the main subject. It also effectively describes the transition from an obscured view to a clearer one.\n*   **Areas for Improvement:** The primary violation is describing an unseen item (the jacket). The secondary issue is misidentifying the subject's action (standing vs. walking).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is a good attempt but fails on two key points of accuracy: the subject's action and the description of an item that is not visible. To improve, the caption should be corrected to state the person is **walking** and the mention of the **jacket** should be removed entirely.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with an obscured view through tall, dry grass, which then clears to reveal the lower body of a person walking forward. Filmed from a low angle, the shot follows the individual's legs and feet as they move through the dense, brown vegetation. The person is wearing beige pants tucked into dark green rubber boots, which crunch over the dry stalks covering the ground.",
