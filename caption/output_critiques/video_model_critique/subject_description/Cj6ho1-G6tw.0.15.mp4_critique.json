    "pre_caption": "This is a coastal scenery shot that presents a layered view of the sea from a rocky shoreline. A large, dark rock with patches of yellow lichen dominates the right foreground, creating a natural frame for the scene beyond. The midground features the dark, choppy sea, with several smaller, seaweed-covered rocks breaking the surface. In the distance, a prominent, pale, dome-shaped island sits on the horizon beneath a cloudy, overcast sky. The video lacks a distinct main subject; instead, the focus is on the overall atmosphere and the grand scale of the natural environment. The static composition emphasizes the rugged texture of the rocks, the vastness of the water, and the imposing presence of the distant island.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is overly long and contains redundant information. The final sentence, \"The static composition emphasizes the rugged texture of the rocks, the vastness of the water, and the imposing presence of the distant island,\" should be deleted. This sentence is redundant as it repeats descriptive elements already mentioned in the preceding sentences (the rocks, the water, the island). It also offers an analysis of the composition (\"emphasizes\") rather than a direct description of the subjects, which is not required by the instructions. Removing this sentence will make the caption more concise while still fully adhering to all instructions.",
