    "pre_caption": "The video features a close-up of a person's hands holding a small notepad and sketching with a pen. The hands have a light skin tone and are focused on drawing a detailed sketch of a lighthouse on the notepad. The sketch includes the lighthouse structure with surrounding lines indicating the landscape or additional features. The pen is actively moving, suggesting the drawing is in progress. The notepad is spiral-bound at the top, and the scene emphasizes the act of drawing and the intricate details of the sketch.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on this caption. It is well-written, detailed, and closely follows the provided instructions. Here is a breakdown of the feedback:\n\n### Feedback\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate in its description of the scene's components and action. It correctly identifies the close-up on the hands, the act of sketching, the type of notepad, and the nature of the pen's movement. The only point of potential inaccuracy is identifying the drawing as a \"lighthouse.\" While it is a tower-like structure, it also strongly resembles a crane or an oil derrick, especially with the visible support beams and what appear to be cables. A more neutral term like \"tower-like structure\" or \"crane\" might be more precise.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is very complete. It successfully captures all the key subjects and their relevant attributes: the person's hands (light skin tone), the notepad (small, spiral-bound), the pen (in motion), and the sketch itself (detailed, framed within the page). It effectively conveys the entire visual content of the short clip.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres to the instructions exceptionally well.\n    *   It is a single, coherent paragraph written in natural English.\n    *   It focuses on the salient subjects and their visual attributes without getting distracted by the blurry background.\n    *   It avoids subjective emotional language and refrains from mentioning non-visible elements or making unsupported assumptions (with the minor exception of the \"lighthouse\" interpretation).\n    *   It correctly identifies subject types and describes their key features.\n    *   It correctly notes the action (\"sketching,\" \"pen is actively moving\") which is central to the video.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThis is an excellent caption that meets all the core requirements of the prompt. The description is clear, concise, and provides a thorough visual summary. The only minor area for improvement would be to use a more general or arguably more accurate term for the object being sketched to avoid potential misinterpretation. Otherwise, it's a perfect example of how to follow the given instructions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features a close-up of a person's hands holding a small notepad and sketching with a pen. The hands have a light skin tone and are focused on drawing a detailed sketch of a tall, tower-like structure, resembling a crane or derrick, on the notepad. The sketch includes the structure's framework with support beams and cables, framed within a rectangle on the page. The pen is actively moving, suggesting the drawing is in progress. The notepad is spiral-bound at the top, and the scene emphasizes the act of drawing and the intricate details of the sketch.",
