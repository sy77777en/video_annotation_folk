    "pre_caption": "This video presents a sweeping aerial cityscape scenery shot of Venice, Italy, captured during a golden sunset. The camera glides down the Grand Canal, moving towards the iconic, white stone Rialto Bridge with its distinct arches. The city's dense architecture, characterized by buildings with red-tiled roofs, is bathed in the warm, low-angled light of the setting sun. On the dark green water of the canal, several long, white water buses (vaporettos) are docked or moving, alongside smaller motorboats and gondolas. There is no single main subject in this shot. The focus is instead on conveying the grand scale and atmospheric beauty of the entire urban landscape, emphasizing the unique interplay of historic architecture, water, and light that defines the city.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is mostly accurate but contains subjective language that violates the instructions. The terms \"iconic,\" \"warm,\" \"atmospheric beauty,\" and \"unique interplay\" are subjective or interpretative. The final sentence, while correctly explaining the lack of a main subject, is overly descriptive and should be more concise and objective. To improve, remove \"iconic\" from the description of the Rialto Bridge. In the final sentence, replace \"conveying the grand scale and atmospheric beauty of the entire urban landscape, emphasizing the unique interplay of historic architecture, water, and light that defines the city\" with a more direct explanation, such as \"the focus is on the scale of the urban landscape and the relationship between its architecture, water, and light.\"",
