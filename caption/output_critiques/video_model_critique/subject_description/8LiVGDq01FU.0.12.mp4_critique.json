The suit includes a backpack-like apparatus, suggesting space exploration or a similar environment. The man is oriented sideways, appearing to be in a confined or narrow space, possibly maneuvering or inspecting something.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption is very well-written and provides a strong description of the video content. Here is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the provided instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subject as a man in a spacesuit and accurately describes his visible features, such as his focused expression and the clear visor on his helmet. The description of the suit as \"dark\" and \"bulky\" with a \"backpack-like apparatus\" is also precise.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe description is comprehensive, covering the most salient aspects of the video. It details the subject's attire, his orientation, and the context implied by his gear. It successfully captures the essence of the scene without getting lost in minor, insignificant details.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Subject Identification & Attributes:** You correctly identify the subject as a \"man\" and provide excellent detail on his visual attributes (\"dark, bulky spacesuit,\" \"helmet that has a clear visor,\" \"backpack-like apparatus\").\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is a single, coherent paragraph written in clear and natural English, as requested.\n*   **Focus on Subject:** The description remains focused on the main subject. The mention of the \"confined or narrow space\" is used effectively to contextualize the man's posture, which aligns with the instructions.\n*   **Objectivity:** The caption does a good job of avoiding overly subjective or emotional language. \"Focused expression\" is a good, neutral descriptor of his look.\n*   **Avoiding Prohibited Elements:** The caption successfully avoids using terms like \"image\" or \"frame\" and does not refer to specific moments in time.\n\n**Area for Minor Improvement:**\n*   The phrase \"suggesting space exploration or a similar environment\" and the final sentence about the lighting \"emphasizing the technical and protective nature of his attire\" are minor interpretations. While they are logical and well-supported by the visual evidence, a stricter adherence to the rules would involve stating only what is directly visible. For instance, instead of explaining what the lighting emphasizes, you could simply describe the visual effect, such as \"Strong lighting from the side illuminates his helmet and the shoulder of his suit, leaving the rest in deep shadow.\" However, as written, your caption is more descriptive and engaging, and the inferences are very reasonable.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is excellent. It is accurate, detailed, and follows nearly all instructions perfectly. The minor use of inference adds valuable context without straying into unsupported speculation, making the description both informative and easy to visualize.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A man is shown in profile, wearing a dark, bulky spacesuit with a helmet that has a clear visor. His face is visible inside, showing a focused expression. The suit includes a backpack-like apparatus. He is positioned in a dark, narrow space with vertical lines in the background. Strong lighting from above and to the side illuminates his helmet and the shoulder of his suit, leaving much of his body and the surroundings in deep shadow.",
