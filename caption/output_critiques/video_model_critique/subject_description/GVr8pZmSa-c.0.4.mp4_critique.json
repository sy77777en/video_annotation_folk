    "pre_caption": "The video features a wooden sailing ship navigating through rough, turbulent ocean waters. The ship is characterized by its large, dark sails and detailed wooden structure, including a prominent deck and railings. The vessel appears sturdy, with visible cabins and masts. The ocean is depicted with high, crashing waves, emphasizing the ship's struggle against the elements. The ship's orientation changes from being prominently visible to partially submerged, suggesting a challenging journey through the stormy sea.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on the caption. It is accurate, well-structured, and adheres closely to the provided instructions. Here is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the primary subject as a \"wooden sailing ship\" and the setting as \"rough, turbulent ocean waters.\"\n*   The descriptions of the ship's features (\"large, dark sails,\" \"detailed wooden structure,\" \"deck and railings,\" \"cabins and masts\") and the ocean (\"high, crashing waves\") are precise and match the visuals perfectly.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is very thorough, capturing the essence of the scene. It describes the subject, its key attributes, the environment, and the action of being tossed by the waves.\n*   The only minor detail not mentioned is the small, white, humanoid figure standing on the deck. While this is a small element, including it would make the description even more comprehensive. However, its omission is understandable as the primary focus is the ship's struggle with the sea.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is a single, fluent paragraph that is both concise and easy to understand.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It uses the precise term \"wooden sailing ship\" and avoids vague language.\n*   **Visual Attributes:** The description of the ship's and ocean's visual attributes is specific and detailed, as requested.\n*   **Objectivity:** The caption successfully avoids overly subjective or emotional language. Terms like \"turbulent\" and \"crashing\" are descriptive of the physical state of the water, and \"challenging journey\" is a reasonable inference based on the visual evidence of the ship being partially submerged.\n*   **Structure:** It correctly combines details from across the video into a cohesive summary without referring to specific frames. It also accurately notes the change in the ship's state over time (\"partially submerged\").\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is excellent. It provides a clear, detailed, and objective description that perfectly aligns with the video content and the instructions. The only potential improvement would be to mention the small figure on deck for absolute completeness, but as it stands, the caption is a high-quality example of what was requested.",
