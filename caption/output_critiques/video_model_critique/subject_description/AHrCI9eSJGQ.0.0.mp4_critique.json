    "pre_caption": "This video captures a dramatic seascape scenery shot from the perspective of a large container ship sailing on the open ocean. There is no single main subject, as the composition is designed to emphasize the immense scale of the environment and the atmospheric conditions rather than a specific object. The foreground is filled with stacks of shipping containers, which lead the eye out to a vast, calm sea that stretches to the horizon. Above, the sky is a breathtaking canvas of soft pinks and purples near the horizon, suggesting either sunrise or sunset, which transitions into a deep teal higher up, all under a blanket of scattered, wispy clouds and a more formidable cloud bank to the right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption violates the instruction to avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions by using the words \"dramatic\" and \"breathtaking.\" The description of the containers \"effectively direct[ing] the viewer's gaze\" is also an interpretation of compositional effect rather than a direct visual description. Furthermore, the instruction for scenery shots suggests a concise description of one to three sentences, and the current four-sentence paragraph is overly descriptive. The caption should be revised to remove subjective language and be condensed into a more concise, objective description of the scene.",
