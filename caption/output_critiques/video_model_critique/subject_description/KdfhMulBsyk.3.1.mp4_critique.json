    "pre_caption": "This video presents a cityscape scenery shot of a London street at night during a rain shower. The wet, dark pavement glistens, creating vivid, elongated reflections of the bright lights from street lamps and closed storefronts, which line the sidewalk. In the distance, the headlights of cars, including classic black London taxis, cut through the darkness, while a traditional red postbox stands prominently in the foreground. The focus remains on the overall environment and moody atmosphere, with the camera moving steadily down the sidewalk to capture the scale and ambiance of the rainy urban setting rather than highlighting a specific subject.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly classifies the video as a scenery shot without a salient subject, and as a result, it completely omits the description of the person walking with an umbrella who is the initial focus of the shot. The instruction states that if salient human subjects are present, the description should focus on them. The caption also makes a factually incorrect claim that the video does not highlight a specific subject, when the camera clearly follows the person for the first few seconds. Additionally, the caption uses the subjective adjective \"moody,\" which should be avoided. The description should be rewritten to begin with the person, detailing their dark clothing, umbrella, and the bag they are carrying, before briefly describing the setting of the wet, reflective London street, the cars, and the red postbox.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video begins by focusing on a person in a dark jacket walking along a city sidewalk at night, holding a black umbrella and carrying a bag. The camera follows them for a few moments before continuing down the sidewalk. The setting is a London street during a rain shower, where the wet pavement glistens with elongated reflections from street lamps and storefronts. In the background, cars, including black London taxis, are visible on the street, and a red postbox stands in the foreground.",
