    "pre_caption": "In a dimly lit room, a person wearing a light-colored, loose-fitting shirt gets into a bed positioned on the right. The bed is made with light green sheets and a matching pillow. The person pulls a patterned, dark green blanket over their body, obscuring themselves from view. To the left, a lit lamp with a white, trapezoidal shade and a dark, curved base sits on a dark nightstand with a greenish-blue top, casting a focused pool of light onto the wall behind it. A small, dark, cylindrical object is also visible on the nightstand next to the lamp.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows a person getting into bed and covering themselves with a blanket in a bedroom setting. On the left side of the frame, there is a prominent lamp, while the bed occupies 70% of the frame's width on the right. After getting into bed and pulling the blanket over themselves, most of the person's body is obscured under the blanket.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on this caption. It is a well-crafted, detailed, and accurate description that adheres closely to all the provided instructions.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is perfectly accurate. Every detail mentioned—the dimly lit setting, the person's light-colored shirt, the action of getting into bed, the light green sheets, the patterned dark green blanket, the description of the lamp and nightstand, and the small cylindrical object—is a precise reflection of the video's content.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe description is exceptionally complete. It successfully identifies and describes all the key subjects and their actions. It captures the primary action of the person getting into bed and disappearing, and it also provides a thorough description of the static but visually important elements, like the lamp that serves as the scene's only light source.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption follows the instructions flawlessly:\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It strikes an excellent balance, providing rich detail without being overly wordy.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** It correctly focuses on the person as the main subject and the lamp/nightstand as the key secondary subjects.\n*   **Avoids Speculation:** You correctly identify the main figure as a \"person\" (since gender is not clear) and the item on the nightstand as a \"small, dark, cylindrical object\" without guessing its function. This is a perfect application of the rule to avoid describing what is uncertain.\n*   **Describes Action and Transition:** The description of the person getting into bed and then being obscured by the blanket is clear and effectively conveys the main action and transition in the scene.\n*   **Formatting and Language:** The caption is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English, with no introductory text or markdown, as requested.\n*   **Attribute Detail:** The level of detail is excellent, particularly in describing the lamp's \"white, trapezoidal shade\" and \"dark, curved base,\" and the nightstand's \"greenish-blue top.\"\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThis is an exemplary caption that demonstrates a complete understanding of the instructions. It is accurate, comprehensive, and well-written. No improvements are needed.",
