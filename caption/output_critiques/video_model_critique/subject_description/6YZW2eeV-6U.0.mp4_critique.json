    "pre_caption": "The video, filmed from a first-person POV, follows three people walking through an ancient structure. Initially, two people are fully visible. The first person, wearing a white hat, a striped shirt, and denim shorts, carries a red backpack and walks ahead. The second person, dressed in a black outfit with a red cap, walks beside the first. Later, a third person appears from the left, showing only his upper body, wearing a blue and white jacket. The people occupy only half the frame's height, emphasizing the ancient stone walls and pathway surrounding them.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **This video is filmed from a first-person POV and follows three people walking through an ancient structure. In the beginning,  two people are fully visible in the frame. Later, a third person in blue shows up from the left, showing only his upper body. The people take up only half the frame's height, leaving more content to emphasize the surroundings.**\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **Partially Accurate:** The caption correctly identifies that the video is filmed from a first-person POV and follows people walking.\n*   **Inaccurate:** The description of the second person is incorrect. He is wearing a blue t-shirt, not a \"black outfit,\" and the cap is dark, but calling it \"red\" is an unsubstantiated guess.\n*   **Inaccurate:** The third person appears on the right side of the frame, not \"from the left.\"\n*   **Slightly Inaccurate:** The first person's shorts are patterned, not clearly \"denim shorts.\"\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption does a good job of describing the main subject (the man with the red backpack) and identifying the other subjects.\n*   It effectively captures the context by mentioning the \"ancient structure\" and the scale, which is a key part of the scene.\n*   It could be slightly more complete by mentioning the prominent long shadows cast by the people, which is a strong visual element due to the low sun angle.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Good Adherence:** The caption is a single, coherent paragraph, uses simple English, and avoids subjective emotional adjectives. It correctly identifies subject types (\"people\") and attempts to describe their visual attributes. It also avoids terms like \"image\" or \"video.\"\n*   **Needs Improvement:** The caption violates the rule \"You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about\" by making incorrect statements about the second person's clothing and the third person's entry point. These factual errors are the most significant issue.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is a good attempt but fails on the critical point of accuracy. It correctly structures the description and follows most formatting rules, but the factual errors regarding the subjects' clothing and positions make it a poor description of the video content. To be a good caption, it must be factually correct.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a first-person perspective, the view follows people walking along a brick pathway through a passage between massive, carved stone walls. A person in the center wears a white hat, a striped shirt, patterned shorts, and a red backpack. Another person in a blue t-shirt and a dark cap is briefly visible beside them. On the right side of the frame, the back of a third person wearing a blue and white jacket is visible. The low sun casts long, dark shadows of the people onto the pathway ahead.",
