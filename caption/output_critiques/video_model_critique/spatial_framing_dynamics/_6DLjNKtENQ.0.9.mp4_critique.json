    "pre_caption": "In this close-up, over-the-shoulder shot, the back of a man's head and shoulder occupies the left foreground. In the center middle ground, another man is framed from the chest up, looking toward the left of the frame. The background is dark and out of focus. The camera remains static and positioned at the subjects' eye level throughout the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A middle-aged, light-skinned man with short, dark, graying hair and a short beard is shown in a close-up, looking toward the dark-skinned man in the foreground. He wears a dark suit jacket, a white collared shirt, and a dark tie, and has a small white bandage on his right forehead. In the foreground, only the back of the dark-skinned man's head is visible as he looks downward toward the center of the frame.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a dimly lit interior characterized by predominantly cool, blue colors, with the exception of yellowish tube lights hanging from the ceiling. An out-of-focus figure is positioned in the foreground, creating a perspective that looks toward the main subject. The background is dark and indistinct, featuring only the ceiling and the hanging tube lights. In the mid-ground, a man with a salt-and-pepper beard is shown wearing a dark suit, a white collared shirt, and a dark tie. A small, white bandage is visible on his right temple.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
