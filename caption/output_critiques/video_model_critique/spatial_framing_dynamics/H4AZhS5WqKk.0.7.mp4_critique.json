    "pre_caption": "The scene is framed with a close-up of a large, gray-blue cat's head positioned in the left foreground. In the right middle ground, a smaller, red cat is shown in a full-body shot, hovering on a small white cloud against a background of a dark brick wall. The red cat moves from the right middle ground into the left foreground, momentarily occupying the same depth as the gray-blue cat. After yellow sparkles flash in the foreground on the left, the red cat retreats to its initial position in the right middle ground, standing on the cloud. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout this sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two cartoon-style animated cats. On the left is a close-up of the head of a large, gray-blue cat with a white muzzle, yellow eyes, and long black whiskers; its expression changes from initially angry to shocked after being punched, and then it becomes even angrier. To the right, a much smaller, full-bodied cat, identical in facial structure but entirely red, is dressed as a devil in red shorts with a pointed tail and red shoes. This red cat, holding a red trident, is positioned on a small white cloud and faces the larger cat with a menacing expression.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a nighttime urban setting, two animated cats are set against a realistic backdrop featuring a dark brick wall and a blurry dark structure with blurred white lights. A small, white, fluffy cloud hovers in the air beneath the red cat, and right after the red cat punches the gray-blue cat, yellow, triangular, cartoon-style sparkle effects flash near the gray-blue cat's nose. The scene's lighting is dim, suggesting it takes place after dark.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features two cartoon-style animated cats. The gray-blue character on the left is shown in a close-up of its head, while the red character on the right is shown in full body.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly describes two separate shots, which are divided by a hard cut, as a single continuous scene. It also misidentifies the 3D position of the red cat as being in the foreground when it is in the middle ground. The description should be restructured to address the two distinct shots. The first shot features an extreme close-up of the large cat's head on the left, with the smaller red cat in a full shot, mid-air, in the upper-right middle ground. After the hard cut, the second shot is a close-up of the large cat on the left, now with a different expression, while the red cat is standing on a cloud in the right middle ground against a different background. The caption fails to mention these changes in the subjects' actions, positions, and the background environment.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The first shot is an extreme close-up of a large, gray-blue cat's shocked face on the left. In the upper-right middle ground, a smaller, red cat in a devil costume, holding a trident, lunges forward mid-air, surrounded by yellow sparkles. A small white cloud is positioned below him against a dark, blurry background. Following a hard cut, the scene changes to a close-up of the large, gray-blue cat, still on the left, but now with an angry and determined expression. The small, red devil cat is now standing firmly on the white cloud in the right middle ground, confronting the larger cat against a new background of a dark brick wall at night.",
