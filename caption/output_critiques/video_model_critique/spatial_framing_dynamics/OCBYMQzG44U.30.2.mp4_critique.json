    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot, using a first-person perspective to navigate the environment. The sequence begins with a high-angle shot looking down into the entrance of a red water slide, which is positioned in the center foreground of a white-tiled room. The camera then moves forward and down, entering the slide, and the frame transitions to a tight shot from within the dark, red, tubular structure. A bright light appears in the center distance, creating depth as the camera travels toward it. The perspective emerges into a low-angle, water-level wide shot of a long, flooded hallway. The murky water occupies the foreground, with colorful pool floats scattered across the surface from the foreground to the middle ground. The hallway's white-tiled walls line the left and right sides of the frame, receding into the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a surreal indoor scenery shot, capturing a disorienting journey through a liminal space. The sequence begins in a sterile, green-lit room with white tiled walls, looking down the mouth of a vibrant red water slide. The perspective then plunges into the dark, enclosed tube of the slide, a tight, reddish-brown tunnel that opens toward a bright light. The camera emerges at water level into a long, narrow, flooded hallway, also lined with white tiles and small, high windows. The murky green water is populated by several colorful, abandoned-looking pool floats, including a yellow, purple, cyan, and two orange rings. The video lacks a main subject, instead using the first-person perspective to immerse the viewer in the strange and unsettling atmosphere of the environment itself.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, begins by looking down the entrance of a red, enclosed water slide situated in a room with white tiled walls and floors. The perspective travels down the dark red, tubular slide, emerging from the end into a body of water. The view is now at water level in a long, narrow, flooded hallway, also lined with white tiles, featuring a large ceiling light. Small windows are visible high up on the walls, and several colorful inflatable pool floats—including a yellow ring, a purple tube, and an orange animal shape—drift on the surface of the murky green water.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption's opening, \"This video presents a wide scenery shot,\" is an oversimplification, as the shot size changes from a wide shot to a tight shot and back to a wide shot. This introductory phrase should be removed, and the description should begin directly with the first scene's framing. Additionally, the phrase \"a level, water-level wide shot\" is redundant; it should be condensed to \"a water-level wide shot\" for improved conciseness. The rest of the caption accurately describes the spatial framing, camera movement, and positioning of elements as instructed.",
