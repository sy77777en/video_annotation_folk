    "pre_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of a man, capturing him from the chest up. Initially, he is positioned slightly off-center to the right in the frame, with his head turned towards the left. The folder he holds is in the foreground, closer to the bottom left of the frame. As he opens the folder, his hands move slightly, bringing the folder into clearer view in the middle ground. After examining the contents, he shifts his gaze upward and places the folder at the top left corner of the frame, moving it from the foreground to the background. The man remains in the same general area throughout the sequence, with the camera maintaining a steady position at his eye level. The background consists of dimly lit, indistinct shapes, suggesting a confined indoor space. The lighting emphasizes the man and the folder while keeping the background subdued. There are no significant changes in the camera angle or height during the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man with a medium skin tone and short dark hair, who has a beard and mustache. He is wearing a dark leather jacket and is seen holding a folder-like item, which he opens to view its contents. His expression is focused as he examines the folder briefly. After inspecting it, he looks up and places the folder at the top left of the frame. The lighting casts shadows on his face, highlighting his features.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting with dim, moody lighting, creating a shadowy atmosphere. The environment appears to be a confined space, possibly a room with dark walls. The time of day is indeterminate due to the low light, but the scene suggests an evening or nighttime setting. Notable visual elements include a person holding an object, possibly food, with a focused expression. The person is wearing a dark leather jacket, adding to the subdued color palette. The lighting casts soft shadows, highlighting the texture of the jacket and the person's features. The overall scene conveys a sense of quiet introspection within a confined, dimly lit space.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Feedback:**\n\nThe caption successfully identifies the shot size as a close-up and correctly describes the man's initial 2D position (off-center right) and the 3D position of the object he holds (foreground). However, it contains significant inaccuracies regarding the action, the object's movement, and the camera's height.\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description of the action is incorrect. The man does not \"open the folder\" or \"place the folder at the top left corner.\" Instead, he clenches his fist and crushes the paper-like object in his hand. Consequently, the description of the object moving \"from the foreground to the background\" is also inaccurate; the object remains in his hand in the foreground throughout the clip. Furthermore, the caption states the camera is at \"eye level,\" but it is clearly positioned below the subject, creating a low-angle shot looking up at him.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption fails to describe the most significant movement in the scene: the man crushing the object. It also misinterprets his upward glance as happening *after* an action that doesn't occur.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption violates the core instruction to provide an accurate description of spatial dynamics and movement. By misrepresenting the central action and the camera's height, it fails to be a factual representation of the video. The phrase \"After examining the contents\" is also a slight over-interpretation of his mental state, where a more objective description like \"after looking at the object\" would be more appropriate.\n\nIn summary, while the caption starts with a correct assessment of the initial framing, it falters by describing actions and spatial changes that do not happen in the video and by misidentifying the camera angle. The description needs to be revised to accurately reflect the man's action of crushing the object and the low-angle perspective of the shot.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video presents a low-angle, close-up shot of a man, capturing him from the chest up. He is positioned in the right half of the frame, with his head in profile, looking towards the left. In his hands, located in the foreground towards the bottom left, he holds a paper-like object. He then clenches his fist, crushing the object in his hand. As he does this, his expression intensifies, and he shifts his gaze upward. The crushed object remains in his hand in the foreground. The camera is static throughout the clip. The background is dark and indistinct, with the lighting focused on the man's face and hands, keeping the surroundings in shadow.",
