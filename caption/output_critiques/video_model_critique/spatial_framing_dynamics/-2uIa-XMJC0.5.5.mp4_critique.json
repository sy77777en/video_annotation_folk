    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a woman on a skateboard, positioned in the top right of the frame and in the middle ground, with the camera looking down at her from above. A cityscape occupies the background. She skateboards towards the center and launches into the air, at which point the camera follows her, reframing her in a full shot at the center of the frame, now at her height, with the city visible in the distant background. The camera then dynamically follows her descent, briefly showing a motion-blurred perspective as she lands on another rooftop. The sequence concludes with the woman stationary in the center foreground, with the camera now positioned below her, looking up at her against the city skyline in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with fair skin is shown skateboarding. She is dressed in all-white attire, consisting of a tank top, pants, and a beanie. A prominent feature is her prosthetic left leg, which is visible from the knee down and has an intricate, mechanical design. She rides a skateboard that has a wooden deck.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene unfolds in a sprawling, modern city during a clear day, with the action taking place across various rooftops. The urban landscape is characterized by a dense collection of skyscrapers and buildings of varying architectural styles, situated alongside a wide body of water. A person dressed in white clothing, including a beanie, rides a wooden skateboard, performing aerial maneuvers between buildings. The perspective dynamically follows the skateboarder as they launch from ramps, soar high above the city against a blue sky with light clouds, and land on different rooftops, some of which are covered in solar panels. The sun casts distinct shadows across the concrete and metal surfaces of the urban environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is now above the woman. As she jumps, the camera moves to the same height as the woman, and then to the bottom of the woman.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly describes the subject's initial position and movement; the video begins with a high-angle shot where the woman is in the upper-right of the frame, moving down a slope towards the lower-left, not from the center moving to the right. The description of the airborne shot is also inaccurate; it is a wide shot where she is a small figure in the center-left of the frame, with the camera looking up at her from below, not a full shot at her height. Additionally, the caption omits the brief shot that follows her from behind as she lands on the second rooftop before the final static shot. The sentence structure describing the launch is also confusing and should be clarified to describe the sequence of shots more distinctly.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with a high-angle shot of a woman on a skateboard in the upper right of the frame, moving down a sloped rooftop towards the lower left, with a cityscape in the background. As she launches into the air, the scene cuts to a wide, low-angle shot of her as a small figure in the center-left of the frame, high above the distant city. The camera then follows her descent with a motion-blurred perspective, followed by a brief tracking shot from behind as she lands on a second rooftop. The sequence concludes with a static, low-angle shot looking up at the woman, who is now stationary in the center foreground against the city skyline.",
