    "pre_caption": "The video captures a wide shot of an urban street scene, emphasizing the entire breadth of the sidewalk and road. The camera remains stationary, providing a consistent view of the environment. On the left side of the frame, modern buildings with glass and concrete facades occupy the foreground and middle ground, extending into the background. The sidewalk, lined with trees and bordered by small bushes, runs parallel to the road and occupies the lower portion of the frame. In the middle ground on the right, a white truck is parked near the curb, with orange traffic cones placed around it. Vehicles move along the road in the background, adding dynamism to the scene. The sky, visible at the top of the frame, is clear and blue, indicating pleasant weather. The camera's height is at eye level, offering a natural perspective of the street and its surroundings. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial position throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing a vibrant urban environment. The focus is on the bustling street lined with modern buildings, showcasing a mix of architectural styles. The scene includes a variety of elements such as trees, street signs, and vehicles, contributing to the dynamic atmosphere. The presence of pedestrians and moving cars adds to the lively city vibe. The emphasis is on the overall environment and the interaction of urban elements, rather than a specific object, highlighting the scale and energy of city life.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, walking along a city street during the day. The setting is outdoors, featuring a wide sidewalk lined with trees and modern buildings. The sky is clear and blue, suggesting pleasant weather. On the left, buildings with a mix of glass and concrete facades rise, while the right side shows a road with several vehicles moving away from the camera, including a white truck parked at the roadside. Pedestrians walk along the sidewalk, and there are signs with Japanese text mounted on poles. The sidewalk is a mix of gray tiles and textured concrete, bordered by small, neatly trimmed bushes. The scene conveys a sense of urban life with its clean, organized environment and steady flow of traffic and pedestrians.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption generally follows the instruction but misses some key spatial details and contains minor inaccuracies. It does not specify the camera height, which is at approximately eye level with pedestrians. The caption should mention that the shot size is a wide shot, with the sidewalk and street occupying the center and right of the frame, and the buildings on the left. It should also note that the main human subjects—pedestrians—move from the foreground to the background or vice versa, with one person initially in the bottom right foreground exiting the frame, and another with an umbrella entering from the background and passing into the foreground right. The parked white truck is in the middle ground right, and another truck is further back in the background right. The caption should clarify that the camera moves steadily forward, causing foreground elements to exit the frame while new elements enter from the background, and that the spatial arrangement remains consistent with the sidewalk and road running parallel from foreground to background. The mention of the sky and weather is unnecessary per the instruction and should be omitted. The caption should be more concise and focus strictly on spatial framing, shot size, subject positions, and movement.",
