    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide, slightly high-angle view of a foggy harbor. A stone quay occupies the foreground at the bottom and left of the frame. In the middle ground, several large boats are moored from the center to the right, with a small blue boat positioned just left of the center. A row of buildings lines the quay in the middle ground on the left. In the distant background, the silhouettes of a bridge and a building are centered and obscured by fog. A pair of hands holding a black camera then enters from the bottom of the frame, rising to occupy the bottom-center foreground. The hands lift the camera, framing the scene, with the camera's rear screen becoming visible as it partially obscures the boats.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person perspective, the video opens on a foggy harbor scene. Several traditional wooden boats with dark hulls, yellow prows, and red markings, some bearing the name \"CRUZ,\" are moored at a pier next to a small, simple blue boat. On the left, old, multi-story buildings line the stone quay. In the distance, the silhouettes of a bridge and another large building are barely discernible through the thick, grey fog. A pair of light-skinned hands enters the view, holding a black digital camera and raising it to frame a photograph of the misty scene. The camera's rear screen is visible, showing a live view of the boats on the calm water.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a foggy morning along the Douro River in Porto. Thick white fog blankets the scene, partially obscuring a distant bridge and buildings on the far bank. Several traditional Rabelo boats with dark hulls, red and white cabins, and distinctive yellow rudders are moored at a stone quay next to the calm, dark water. A small, simple blue boat is also moored to the quay. On the left, multiple multi-story buildings with numerous windows line the street along the edge of the harbor. A pair of hands raises a black camera into the view, framing a photograph of the boats against the misty backdrop.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
