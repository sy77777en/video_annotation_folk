    "pre_caption": "A close-up shot focuses on the lower right portion of a cylindrical container, which is positioned in the middle ground. The base of the container is centered in the frame, with a leak visible on its upper edge. Below the base, support structures extend toward the bottom of the frame. In the background, a dark, gridded floor is visible on the left and bottom, establishing the scene's depth. The camera is positioned at the level of the container's base. The only movement is the downward fall of liquid droplets from the leak in the center of the frame, while the camera and the container remain static.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A close-up view shows a cylindrical container with a translucent, teal-colored upper section and a light gray, opaque base. A clear liquid is leaking from the seam where the two sections meet. The liquid pools on the curved rim of the base, and multiple droplets are depicted falling from the pool. A structure with a texture similar to the base and another cylindrical structure with a translucent, white texture are visible below the base.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a simulated environment with a dark, gridded floor marked by white and pink lines, a close-up shot focuses on the base of a cylindrical object. The object consists of a glossy, teal-colored upper section and a matte, light-grey lower section. A clear liquid is shown leaking from the seam between these two parts, pooling along the edge before the droplets fall.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains a contradiction regarding movement. It first states, \"The camera performs a slight downward movement and tilts upward,\" and then immediately follows with, \"The only movement is the downward fall of liquid droplets.\" This should be corrected to accurately describe all movements without contradiction. Additionally, the caption omits the camera's height relative to the subject; it should specify that the camera is positioned at a low angle, looking up at the container, which is implied by the upward tilt. Finally, the phrase \"establishing the scene's depth\" is an interpretation of the visual effect and should be removed to maintain a purely descriptive and concise tone focused on spatial framing.",
