    "pre_caption": "The video commences with a medium close-up, framing a man in a yellow and green shirt in the left foreground and a woman in a blue hoodie and cream beanie in the right foreground. In the center midground, another woman wearing a green baseball cap is visible, with a man in a dark cap to her right in the midground. Several other individuals are positioned in the background, further up a reddish-brown incline. The shot then transitions to a medium full shot, during which the woman in the blue hoodie bends forward slightly, causing her to move lower and slightly to the right within the frame. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with short brown hair, wearing a bright yellow and green long-sleeved shirt featuring a prominent \"TLD\" logo and a colorful neck gaiter, stands smiling. Beside him, a woman with long blonde hair, wearing a cream-colored knit beanie with a pom-pom and a bright blue zip-up hoodie over a black top, also smiles. In the midground, another woman is visible wearing a green baseball cap, dark sunglasses, a dark top, light-colored pants, and a dark backpack. To her left, a man wears a dark baseball cap, dark sunglasses, a dark t-shirt, and carries a backpack. To the right of the woman wearing a green baseball cap, there is another woman with long hair. Several other people are seen in the distant background on a reddish-brown incline.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors on a dirt path winding through a hilly, arid landscape characterized by reddish-brown soil and sparse, low-lying green vegetation. In the background, larger red rock formations rise against a pale sky. Several people are visible on and around the path, some further up the hillside. The lighting suggests daytime.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly states that the shot transitions to a \"full shot\"; it actually widens from a medium close-up to a medium shot, as the subjects are never shown from head to toe. Additionally, the man in the dark cap is not visible at the start of the video but is revealed in the right midground as the shot widens. The description of this change should be more precise, for example, by stating \"the shot then widens\" instead of \"the shot then transitions\" to better reflect the continuous camera movement.",
