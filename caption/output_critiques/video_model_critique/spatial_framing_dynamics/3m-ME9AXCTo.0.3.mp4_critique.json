    "pre_caption": "A man and a woman are framed in a medium close-up shot, positioned in the center of the frame throughout the scene. The camera circles them counter-clockwise as they slow dance, initially capturing the woman's face over the man's right shoulder. As the camera moves, it reveals the man's profile, then his back, and eventually returns to a view of their faces as they kiss. In the background, large, soft red lights are visible at the top of the frame, while shiny, star-shaped decorations hang from the ceiling. A cluster of smaller, colorful lights also appears in the background, shifting position from left to right as the camera orbits the central couple. The camera remains at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dimly lit and hazy setting with colorful lighting, a man and a woman are slow dancing. The man has light skin and long, curly, blonde hair. He is wearing a light-colored suit jacket over a ruffled shirt, a dark bowtie, and a boutonniere with a light pink flower. The woman has light skin and long, straight, blonde hair. She is wearing a light-colored top and has a corsage on her wrist. They hold each other closely, with their hands clasped, and at one point, they look into each other's eyes before sharing a kiss.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor setting, a couple slow dances under hanging, shiny, star-shaped decorations. The scene is enveloped in a hazy, atmospheric glow, dominated by several large, soft red lights that rotate in and out of the frame as the camera moves around the couple. A rotating array of three lights—yellow, blue, and white—adds to the ambiance, positioned close together in the background. The camera gracefully circles the couple as they sway gently in the center of the space.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The description of the subjects' framing during the camera's movement is inaccurate. The caption states the shot \"initially [captures] the side of both the man and the woman\" and then \"reveals the man's back, then his profile.\" In the video, the shot actually begins from behind the man, showing his back and the woman's profile. The subsequent description of the movement is also incorrect. To fix this, the sentence should be revised to more accurately describe the continuous orbital motion and the changing perspectives. For example: \"The camera circles them counter-clockwise, beginning with a view from behind the man that shows his back and the woman's profile. As the camera continues its orbit, it reveals the man's right profile, then his back again as the couple turns, and finally his left profile as they lean in to kiss.\"",
