    "pre_caption": "The video features a wide shot of a bird, likely an egret, positioned in the center of the frame, standing in shallow water. The bird is in the middle ground, with its body oriented upright and slightly moving, causing gentle ripples in the water. Its position remains relatively stable throughout the video. To the left of the bird, in the middle ground, there is a small lump of dark mud. The water, which occupies the entire frame, serves as the background, with its calm surface disrupted only by the bird's movements. The camera is positioned above the bird, providing a clear view of the scene from a higher vantage point.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a bird, likely an egret, standing in shallow water. The bird has a distinctive appearance with a gray body, black and white wings, and a predominantly yellow beak with a noticeable black tip at its pointed end. Its head is light gray, and it appears to be wading or moving slightly in the water. The bird's posture is upright, and it seems to be engaged in a natural behavior typical of its environment. The water around the bird is calm, with slight ripples indicating gentle movement.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows a bird with grey, white, and black plumage and a distinct yellow beak and facial marking, standing and bathing in shallow, murky brown water during the daytime. The water has gentle ripples caused by the bird's movements as it splashes. A small lump of dark mud is visible near the bird on the left side of the scene. The setting is outdoors, focused entirely on this small section of the muddy water body.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "This caption is not good because it contains significant inaccuracies and fails to adhere to key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the issues:\n\n*   **Accuracy of Description:** The caption's description of the action is highly inaccurate. It states the bird is \"slightly moving, causing gentle ripples,\" when the video clearly shows the bird vigorously and rapidly splashing, dipping, and shaking its body in the water. This is the central action of the clip, and the caption completely misrepresents it.\n*   **Shot Size:** The caption identifies the shot as a \"wide shot,\" which is incorrect. It is a medium shot, as the bird is the clear subject and occupies a significant portion of the frame, with the focus being on its actions rather than the wider environment.\n*   **Speculative Language:** The caption uses the phrase \"likely an egret,\" which violates the instruction to \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'.\" The species is also misidentified.\n*   **Description of Elements:** Describing the water as only the \"background\" is an oversimplification. The water constitutes the entire setting, existing in the foreground, middle ground, and background. Stating its surface is \"calm\" is also incorrect, as it is actively being churned by the bird's bathing.\n\nIn summary, the caption fails by misidentifying the shot size, using forbidden speculative language, and most importantly, providing a factually incorrect description of the subject's primary movement and its effect on the environment. It does not accurately describe the spatial dynamics of the scene as instructed.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is a medium shot of a grey and white bird with a yellow beak and facial markings bathing in the center of the frame. The bird is in shallow, muddy water that fills the scene. It vigorously dips its body and head, flapping its wings and shaking, which sends water splashing and creates ripples across the surface. To the left of the bird is a small clump of mud. The camera is positioned at a high angle, looking down at the scene.",
