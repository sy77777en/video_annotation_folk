    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a man standing in the center-middle ground on a city street corner. A large black pole occupies the left foreground. The man, seen from behind, holds a clown mask in his left hand and a blue duffel bag over his right shoulder. Buildings and pedestrians are visible in the middle ground and background on both sides of the frame. The camera then moves in, reframing the subject into a medium shot. In this closer view, the man remains in the center, with the clown mask now positioned in the bottom-left of the frame and the duffel bag on the right. As the shot tightens, a white van enters from the left and moves across the middle ground. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man, viewed from behind, stands on a city street corner. He is dressed in a dark suit jacket and matching trousers. Slung over his right shoulder is a large, blue, rectangular duffel bag. In his left hand, he holds a white clown mask with red-rimmed eyes, a red nose, and blue markings on the forehead and cheeks. In the midground, a white van with a black lower section drives past from left to right at the edge of the frame. Several other pedestrians are visible walking on the sidewalks in the background.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set on a wide city street corner under bright, clear daylight. The paved road, marked with white lines, is flanked by sidewalks and tall, multi-story buildings constructed from light-colored stone and brick. In the background, taller skyscrapers and an elevated train track are visible. A thick black pole stands in the foreground, and various signs, including a green \"P\" for parking and a \"PAYDAY LOANS\" storefront, are seen along the street. A person in a dark suit, viewed from behind, stands on the corner holding a clown mask and a blue duffel bag, as other pedestrians walk in the distance and a van passes by.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly identifies the initial shot size. The video begins with a long shot, where the subject is visible from head to toe but appears small relative to the frame, not a full shot, which would typically have the subject filling more of the vertical space. Therefore, in the first sentence, replace \"full shot\" with \"long shot\". The rest of the caption is accurate and well-written.",
