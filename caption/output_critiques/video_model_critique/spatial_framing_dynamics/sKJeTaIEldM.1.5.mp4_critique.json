    "pre_caption": "This video starts with a medium close-up shot of a man from behind, who is positioned in the center foreground. In the background, a dimly lit and out-of-focus hall is visible. The camera then slowly moves closer to the man, transitioning the shot into a close-up that frames his head and the top of his shoulders. Throughout this movement, he remains in the center of the frame. As the camera advances, the background, revealing a large hall with an audience, becomes slightly more discernible but stays out of focus. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows the back of a man with neatly styled, reddish-brown hair. He is wearing a dark blue suit jacket over a white collared shirt. On his head, he wears a pair of large, vintage-style black headphones with metallic components.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The camera starts with a focus on the back of a man in the foreground, smoothly moving forward while zooming out. He has reddish-brown, styled hair and wears a dark blue suit jacket over a white collared shirt, along with large, vintage-style headphones. Initially, the shallow depth of field makes the background very blurry, but as the camera zooms out, it becomes faintly discernible that he is in a large, dimly lit hall with numerous audience members behind him, surrounded by scattered points of light in a dark, cavernous environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is mostly accurate but can be improved for conciseness and precision. The phrase \"that frames his head and the top of his shoulders\" is redundant after stating the shot transitions into a \"close-up\" and should be removed. Additionally, the description of the background \"revealing a large hall with an audience\" is an overstatement. The background remains heavily out of focus; it only becomes slightly more discernible, suggesting the presence of people rather than clearly revealing them. The wording should be adjusted to reflect this subtlety.",
