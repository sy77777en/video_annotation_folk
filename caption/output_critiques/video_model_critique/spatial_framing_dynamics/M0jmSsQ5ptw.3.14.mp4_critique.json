    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot where a long, white, cylindrical object is suspended in the middle ground, stretching from the upper-left to the center of the frame. A yellow structure is positioned in the middle ground on the right, next to a black barrier that extends toward the center. The paved ground occupies the foreground and bottom half of the frame. The camera then tilts upward and pans left, transitioning to a low-angle wide shot focused on a different subject. In this new framing, a light-colored support post occupies the foreground, rising from the bottom-center of the frame. A sloped channel is visible at the top of the post, and a black spherical object rolls down it from the top-center toward the upper-left. The background shifts from a distant landscape to primarily the cloudy sky.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video opens on a long, white, cylindrical object suspended horizontally on a thin cable that stretches across a paved area. In the middle ground to the right, a yellow metal structure, which appears to be a winch or launch mechanism with pulleys, is positioned next to a tall black barrier and moves leftward. The handheld camera unsteadily moves left, dynamically tracking a large yellow metal frame connected to a cable system, while slightly panning left. The camera then shifts focus to a close-up of a different part of the apparatus. This new view shows a light-colored vertical post supporting a sloped metal channel, within which a black spherical object is rolling downward. A black cable is also visible, attached to the side of the post with a silver carabiner.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Set outdoors on a large, paved expanse under a partly cloudy sky, the scene features a long cable stretched across the area. A white, cylindrical object is suspended from this cable. To the right, a yellow metal structure and a light-colored wooden post with a chain mechanism act as supports, positioned next to a long black wall. In the middle ground, a field of dry grass serves as a separator between the paved area and the distant buildings and mountain range. The handheld camera moves unsteadily to the left, dynamically tracking a large yellow metal frame connected to the cable system, while also slightly panning left. The perspective follows the cable to the top of the support post, revealing a closer view of the pulley system against the sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a wide shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and below the subject when the second subject is in focus.",

  "generated_critique": "The description of the camera movement and the subsequent shot framing contains several inaccuracies. The caption states the camera \"moves left, dynamically tracking a large yellow metal frame,\" but the camera actually moves rapidly forward and tilts upward, moving past the yellow structure to follow the cable system. Furthermore, the change in view is not a \"scene transition\" but a continuous, rapid camera movement. This movement results in a low-angle close-up or medium shot of a different, light-colored support post, not a \"low-angle wide shot\" as the caption claims. The description should be corrected to reflect that the camera dollies forward and tilts up, reframing the scene from a wide shot into a close-up of the second support structure.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with a wide shot of an outdoor area, likely an airfield, under a cloudy sky. A long, white, cylindrical object is suspended on a cable in the middle ground. To the right, a yellow metal structure stands next to a long black barrier on the paved ground. The camera then dollies forward and tilts upward rapidly, moving past the yellow structure to reframe the scene. This continuous movement results in a low-angle close-up of a different, light-colored support post. At the top of this post, a black spherical object is seen rolling down a sloped channel from right to left.",
