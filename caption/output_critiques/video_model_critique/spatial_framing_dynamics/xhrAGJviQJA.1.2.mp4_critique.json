    "pre_caption": "This wide shot is captured from a high-angle, top-down perspective, with the nose cone of a rocket positioned in the foreground at the bottom center of the frame. A camera is mounted centrally on this nose cone. Initially, a cloud of smoke is visible in the middle ground, directly below the rocket in the center of the frame, with the desert ground and other launch structures forming the background. As the rocket ascends, the camera moves vertically away from the ground. This movement causes the background elements—including the smoke cloud, a dirt road, and the surrounding landscape—to recede and shrink within the frame, transitioning the view from a close-up of the launch site to a high-altitude aerial shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A white rocket with orange V-shaped markings on its pointed nose cone is shown from a bird's eye perspective. A black, boxy action camera is mounted near the tip of the nose cone, pointing vertically upward towards the sky. A large, dense cloud of white smoke and dust billows out from the base of the rocket. In the vicinity on the ground, there are several other launch structures, each consisting of a white, triangular base and a long, thin, dark-colored pole extending outwards at an angle.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot from a camera mounted on the nose of a rocket captures its ascent from a desert launch site. As the rocket lifts off, a large cloud of white dust and smoke erupts on the sandy ground below. The arid landscape, characterized by sparse green scrub, a dirt road, and other launch structures casting long shadows, rapidly shrinks from view. The body of the white rocket, marked with an orange V-shape, is prominently visible in both the foreground and middle ground, with the black camera clearly mounted on its tip.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly states that the rocket's nose cone is in \"both the foreground and middle ground\"; it is exclusively in the foreground at the bottom of the frame. The description of the shot size transition from a \"wide shot to an extreme wide shot\" is slightly inaccurate; the shot begins as a medium shot of the ground directly below and rapidly becomes an extreme wide shot. Finally, the concluding phrase, \"emphasizing the size contrast between the rocket and the expansive scene,\" is an interpretation of the visual effect. It is redundant, as the preceding clause already describes the background elements receding and shrinking, and it should be removed to maintain a purely descriptive tone.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This high-angle, top-down shot is captured from a camera mounted on the nose cone of a rocket, which is visible in the foreground at the bottom of the frame.
