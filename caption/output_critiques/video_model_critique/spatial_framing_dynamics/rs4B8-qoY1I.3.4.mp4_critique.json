    "pre_caption": "A wide shot from a tilted overhead angle shows a video game level that scrolls diagonally from the top right to the bottom left. The player's ship begins in the bottom left foreground and moves across the lower half of the frame, navigating a maze on the dark blue floor in the foreground and middle ground. A low, grey brick wall extends from the bottom left into the middle ground, while a taller, light blue wall occupies the background. Stationary elements, including green ground turrets and red barrels, are positioned in the middle ground. Flying enemy aircraft enter from the top right background and move diagonally toward the bottom left. A translucent blue energy barrier periodically appears vertically in the middle ground. The frame includes fixed overlays: a score at the top left, a vertical altitude meter on the left, and a heads-up display at the bottom.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video showcases gameplay from a vintage arcade game with an atypical isometric perspective. The player's vehicle is a small fighter jet with yellow wings and a pink tail, which casts a distinct black shadow on the surface below. Various enemy objects appear, including stationary green ground turrets, flying orange aircraft, and red-and-white striped barrels. The environment features obstacles such as grey, rock-like formations and translucent, blue, cross-hatched energy barriers that stand vertically within the light grey, brick-textured corridors of a fortress.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person isometric (2.5D) gaming video shows a retro arcade game level set within a walled area. The environment features a dark blue floor with a lighter blue maze-like pattern, enclosed by low, gray brick walls. Throughout the level, red and white barrels, green ground turrets, and gray debris are scattered. A small, colorful spaceship flies above the ground, shooting at targets, which results in yellow and red explosions. A blue, grid-like energy barrier periodically appears as an obstacle. The scene includes several overlays: two score displays at the top left, a vertical altitude meter on the left, and a heads-up display at the bottom showing a fuel gauge, lives, an enemy counter, and a \"© SEGA 1982\" copyright notice in the lower right corner.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately describes the isometric view, scrolling direction, and the positions of various game elements. However, it can be improved by incorporating more specific spatial terminology as required by the instructions. First, specify the shot size as a medium shot of the gameplay area. Second, use 3D depth terms to clarify the spatial layers; for example, state that the HUD elements are fixed in the foreground, while the gameplay action occurs in the middle ground. Most importantly, the caption omits the crucial spatial dynamic of the player's ship changing altitude. While it mentions the altitude meter, it should explicitly state that the ship moves vertically (up and down) in the 3D space to navigate over ground-based obstacles like the energy barriers, which is a primary aspect of its movement.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A medium shot from a tilted overhead, isometric angle shows a video game level that scrolls diagonally from the top right to the bottom left. The gameplay action occurs in the middle ground, where the player's ship begins in the bottom left and moves across the lower half of the frame. The ship navigates a maze on the dark blue floor and also moves vertically up and down to fly over ground-based obstacles, such as a low, grey brick wall and a translucent blue energy barrier that periodically appears. Other stationary elements, including green ground turrets and red barrels, are positioned on the floor, while flying enemy aircraft enter from the top right background and move diagonally toward the bottom left. A taller, light blue wall occupies the background. Fixed in the foreground, overlays include a score at the top left, a vertical altitude meter on the left, and a heads-up display at the bottom.",
