    "pre_caption": "The video, captured with a fisheye lens, opens with a full shot of a skateboarder positioned in the center-left foreground, riding towards the right on a light-colored paved surface. As he navigates a curved path across the foreground, the framing shifts to a wide shot. A large, dark grey, multi-tiered monument with bronze statues is prominent in the right middle ground, becoming more central as the skateboarder moves. Behind the monument, a substantial brown brick building with cylindrical towers stands in the background, initially to the right and then more centrally. Additional multi-story buildings and green trees are visible in the far left and far right background, with a partly cloudy sky occupying the top background. The camera maintains the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man skateboarding. He is wearing a maroon long-sleeve shirt and black pants. His hair is short and dark. The man is actively skateboarding, performing tricks and maneuvers on a paved area. His movements are dynamic, and he is oriented towards the camera at different angles throughout the video.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, shot with a fisheye lens creating a circular, distorted perspective, captures an outdoor urban plaza during the daytime. In the mid-ground, a skateboarder moves across a light-colored, smooth paved surface. Dominating the scene is a large, dark grey, multi-tiered monument made of stone, featuring several bronze statues of figures in what appear to be historical or military attire; one prominent statue stands atop a tall pedestal. The monument has \"EMANVELE FILIBERTO DVCA D'AOSTA\" inscribed on its side. Behind this, a substantial, old, brown brick building with cylindrical towers, resembling a castle or fortress, is visible. Further in the background, other multi-story buildings with windows can be seen, along with green trees. The sky is partly cloudy, with patches of blue visible between white clouds.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subject’s framing (shot size) is not stable** throughout the video, so the description should emphasize this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption omits two key spatial details. First, it fails to mention that the video is filmed with a fisheye lens, which significantly distorts the spatial framing, curving the horizon and exaggerating the sense of space. Second, it does not describe the final action where the skateboarder performs a trick, jumping into the air. This is a notable vertical movement where the skateboard briefly occupies the foreground before the clip ends. The description of the background elements shifting is accurate, but it could be clarified that this shift is a result of the camera tracking the skateboarder's movement from left to right.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video, captured with a fisheye lens that distorts the perspective by curving the horizon and exaggerating the sense of space, opens with a skateboarder in the center-left foreground. He rides towards the right on a light-colored, paved surface, navigating a curved path. As the camera tracks his movement from left to right, the background elements shift; a large, dark grey, multi-tiered monument with bronze statues and a brown brick building with cylindrical towers move from the right side of the frame toward the center. The clip concludes with the skateboarder performing a trick, executing a vertical jump as the skateboard flips beneath his feet, its underside briefly occupying the foreground.",
