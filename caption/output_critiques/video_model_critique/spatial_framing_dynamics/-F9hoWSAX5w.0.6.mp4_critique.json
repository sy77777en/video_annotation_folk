    "pre_caption": "The video captures a wide shot of an outdoor basketball court enclosed by a chain-link fence. The camera remains stationary throughout, offering a consistent view of the scene. The basketball court occupies the center of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground. The fence forms the immediate foreground, with its gate slightly ajar, positioned centrally along the bottom edge of the frame. Bare trees line the background, stretching across the top left and top right sections of the frame, while tall buildings appear further back in the distance, situated towards the upper middle part of the scene. Puddles on the court surface are scattered across the middle ground, reflecting the overcast sky above. The camera's height is level with the fence, providing a direct view of the court and surrounding elements without any noticeable elevation or angle change. There are no significant shifts in shot size or spatial positioning throughout the video, maintaining a steady perspective on the environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a landscape scenery shot. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere, highlighting the open space and natural elements like trees and the overcast sky. The absence of a specific main subject emphasizes the mood and setting rather than any particular object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot of an outdoor basketball court surrounded by a chain-link fence. The setting is a park-like area with bare trees, suggesting late autumn or winter. The court is wet, indicating recent rain, and puddles are visible on the ground. In the background, there are tall buildings, hinting at an urban environment. The sky is overcast, contributing to a muted, gray atmosphere. The scene is devoid of people, emphasizing the stillness and quiet of the setting.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on this caption. It is highly accurate, well-structured, and closely follows the provided instructions. Here is a detailed breakdown of feedback:\n\n### Strengths:\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption perfectly adheres to the core requirements. It focuses strictly on spatial framing, avoids subjective language, and is formatted as a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **Accuracy:** The description of the scene is very accurate. It correctly identifies the shot size as a \"wide shot,\" notes the stationary camera, and accurately describes the 2D and 3D positions of the main environmental elements (fence, court, trees, buildings).\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand. It effectively conveys the spatial layout of the scene without unnecessary jargon or flowery descriptions.\n*   **Completeness:** The caption successfully covers the major components of the scene and their relationships to one another and the camera, including the camera's height.\n\n### Areas for Improvement:\nWhile the caption is very strong, it could be made even more comprehensive by including a few more specific, visible elements, as per the instruction to \"analyze as many elements as possible.\"\n\n*   **Missing Elements:** The description omits a few distinct objects that contribute to the scene's composition:\n    *   The **fallen leaves** in the immediate foreground at the bottom of the frame.\n    *   The **basketball hoops**, with one visible on the left and another on the right side of the middle ground.\n    *   A single orange **traffic cone** sitting in the center of the court in the middle ground.\n    *   A **brick building** in the right background.\n*   **Wording Precision:** The gate is described as \"slightly ajar,\" but it appears to be fully open. Using the word \"open\" would be more precise.\n\n### Revised Example for Comparison:\nHere is an example of how the caption could be revised to incorporate this feedback, making it more complete:\n\n\"The video presents a static wide shot of an outdoor basketball court. In the immediate foreground, a chain-link fence spans the frame, with fallen leaves scattered at the bottom and an open gate in the center. Through the gate, the wet basketball court occupies the middle ground, featuring an orange cone at its center and basketball hoops on the left and right sides. Puddles are visible across the court's surface. The background is composed of bare trees on the left and right, a brick building on the right, and taller city buildings visible in the distant center. The camera is positioned at the height of the fence, providing a direct, level view of the scene with no changes in framing or perspective.\"",
