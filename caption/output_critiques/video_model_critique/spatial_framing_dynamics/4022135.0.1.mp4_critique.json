    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a high-angle wide shot from the stadium stands, capturing the football field in the middle ground, which extends from the bottom to the center of the frame. The stands on the opposite side fill the background across the top half of the frame, with a cloudy sky visible above. Initially, the back of a spectator's head is in the bottom right foreground. The camera then pans to the right, revealing more of the stadium. This movement brings the right end zone and a goalpost into the middle ground on the right side, while a building labeled \"RYAN FIELD\" enters the frame in the background on the far right. Simultaneously, more spectators in the immediate foreground are revealed at the bottom right, including a man in a cap shown in profile, as the initial spectator's head shifts toward the bottom center of the view.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a wide shot of a crowded football stadium during a game. The stands are packed with numerous spectators, predominantly dressed in purple and yellow. On the vibrant green field, marked with white yard lines and a large white \"N\" logo at the center, football players in white uniforms and helmets are positioned for a play. Another group of players in similar white uniforms stands along the sideline. As the camera pans to the right, a few spectators in the foreground become more prominent. We see the back of a person's head with short brown hair, wearing a red visor. To their right, a man with short, graying hair is seen in profile, wearing a dark baseball cap and a gray hooded sweatshirt, looking out at the field. Partially visible further away from him is a woman with long blonde hair.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A level-angle, panning shot captures a wide view of a crowded American football stadium, Ryan Field, on an overcast day. The green turf is marked with white yard lines, a large white \"N\" logo at midfield, and the word \"WILDCATS\" in the end zone. Football players in white and dark uniforms are positioned on the field. The stands are packed with thousands of spectators, many wearing purple. Beyond the stadium, a line of green trees and distant buildings are visible beneath a grey sky. Tall light towers with bright lights are on. As the camera pans to the right, it reveals more of the stadium's architecture, including a tan building with \"RYAN FIELD\" inscribed on its side. The back of a spectator's head is visible in the foreground at the bottom of the view.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an open-air stadium during a game, with the stands filled with spectators. The camera is positioned in the stand, initially showing the field and the stands opposite. It then pans to the right, showing some people in the foreground at the frame's right corner, along with parts of the field and distant stands.",

  "generated_critique": "### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the initial framing, the camera movement (a pan to the right), and the resulting changes in the composition of the shot. All described elements—the field, stands, sky, foreground spectators, goalpost, and the \"RYAN FIELD\" building—are present and their spatial positions and movements are described correctly.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is very complete. It effectively covers all aspects requested in the instructions:\n*   **Shot Size & Angle:** Correctly identified as a \"high-angle wide shot.\"\n*   **Spatial Position (2D & 3D):** It successfully maps out the scene by placing elements in the foreground, middle ground, and background, and also specifies their location within the frame (e.g., \"bottom right,\" \"top half,\" \"far right\").\n*   **Dynamics & Movement:** The pan is clearly described, along with how it affects the visibility and framing of every major element in the scene, from the foreground spectators to the background building.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption perfectly adheres to the provided guidelines.\n*   It is a single, concise, and coherent paragraph.\n*   The language is simple, natural, and objective, avoiding emotional or speculative terms.\n*   It focuses strictly on the spatial framing and dynamics as requested.\n*   It systematically breaks down the scene into its spatial layers and describes the changes logically.\n\n**Overall Assessment:** This is an excellent caption. It demonstrates a thorough understanding of the instructions and provides a precise, detailed, and well-structured spatial analysis of the video clip. There are no necessary corrections or improvements.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens on a high-angle wide shot from the stadium stands, showing the football field in the middle ground, with packed stands and a cloudy sky in the background. Initially, the back of a spectator's head is visible in the bottom right foreground. The camera then pans to the right, bringing the right end zone, a goalpost, and a building labeled \"RYAN FIELD\" into view on the right side of the frame. This pan also reveals more spectators in the foreground at the bottom right, including a man in a cap, as the initial spectator's head shifts toward the bottom center.",
