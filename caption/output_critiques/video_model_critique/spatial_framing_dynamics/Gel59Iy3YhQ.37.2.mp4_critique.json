    "pre_caption": "This video is presented from a fixed, first-person perspective, split into two horizontal sections. The top section shows a top-down view of a border crossing in the background, with a queue of figures on the left and guards on the right. The main, lower section depicts the inspector's booth. A man is visible in the center-left middle ground, behind a counter that occupies the foreground. On the right side, an \"M.O.A. CITATION\" is fixed in the foreground, while a \"WANTED\" poster is positioned in the middle ground. In the center, a key and a drawing hang on the back wall in the middle ground. Throughout the clip, a mouse cursor moves various documents onto the desk in the foreground: a red passport appears in the bottom left, followed by a yellow certificate to its right, and finally, a white entry visa is placed in the center, partially covering the other documents. Speech bubbles also appear and disappear near the man in the center-left.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with green-tinged skin, a bald head with green hair on the sides, and a red shirt is depicted from the chest up behind a desk. On the desk and surrounding interface, several documents are displayed. These include a red passport with a gold emblem, a yellow \"Certificate of Vaccination\" for \"JORJI COSTAVA,\" a white \"M.O.A. CITATION\" with purple text indicating a protocol violation, and a white \"ENTRY VISA\" featuring a photo of a bald, bearded man. To the right, a \"WANTED\" poster shows three headshots. Above this scene, a top-down, pixelated view shows a border crossing with a long queue of black figures on the left and several blue figures on the right. Speech bubbles with text such as \"Papers, please.\" and \"Hello Jorji.\" appear near the man. A large, golden key hangs on the wall next to a small, framed drawing of a red stick figure labeled \"Arstotzka Hero.\"**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A screen recording of a software interface depicts a pixel-art border checkpoint from inside a guard's booth. The top portion of the screen shows an overhead view of a bleak, gray checkpoint with a long queue of silhouetted figures on the left and several guards on the right. The main, lower portion is the inspector's workspace, featuring a wooden desk and counter where a green-skinned character in a red shirt is visible through the window. On the desk, a mouse cursor moves various documents, including a red passport, a yellow Certificate of Vaccination, and an Entry Visa. Overlays are present on the screen, including speech bubbles from the character, a \"Papers, Please.\" title in the top left, and a \"WANTED\" poster on the right. A prominent white overlay window for an \"M.O.A. CITATION\" details a protocol violation and a warning.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is mostly accurate but can be improved by adding more specific spatial details as required by the instructions. The shot size for the man is not specified. While the perspective is mentioned, the camera height relative to the subject (eye-level) is omitted. The 3D depth of the elements in the main booth view could be more clearly defined using terms like foreground and middle ground. For example, the desk and documents are in the foreground, while the man and the back wall are in the middle ground. Additionally, the caption fails to mention the movement of a single figure walking from left to right in the top-down view.",

On the back wall behind him, a key and a child's drawing are visible. To the far right, a \"WANTED\" poster is also in the middle ground. The foreground is occupied by the counter.
