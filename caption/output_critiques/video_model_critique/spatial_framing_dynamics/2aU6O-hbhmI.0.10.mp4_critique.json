    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of an urban construction site during twilight, captured from a drone's perspective. Initially, the crane dominates the frame, positioned in the top right quadrant in 2D space and in the foreground in 3D space. As the camera moves, the crane transitions towards the center, maintaining its prominence. The construction site occupies the middle ground, spreading across the lower portion of the frame, with materials and equipment scattered throughout. Surrounding buildings appear in the background, framing the site on the left and right sides. The sky, transitioning from blue to orange, fills the upper part of the frame, indicating the time of day. The camera maintains a high vantage point, consistently positioned above the crane and the construction site, providing an expansive view of the entire scene. The camera movement is smooth, gradually shifting the crane's position while keeping the construction site and surrounding buildings within the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases an urban cityscape with a central focus on a crane positioned prominently in the frame. It captures the intricate details of the construction site within the city environment, highlighting the network of cranes and buildings. The vibrant colors emphasize the bustling atmosphere and ongoing development, with an emphasis on the environment rather than a specific moving subject.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a drone POV, presents an aerial view of an urban construction site during twilight. The scene features a large crane with a metallic structure, its long arm extending across the frame. The sky transitions from a soft blue to a warm orange, indicating the time of day as sunset. Below, the construction site is bustling with activity, showcasing various materials and equipment scattered across the area. Buildings surround the site, with some partially constructed, displaying a mix of concrete and steel. The overall atmosphere is dynamic, with the drone capturing the intricate details of the construction process and the vibrant colors of the evening sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "This is not a good caption for the video.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is highly inaccurate in describing the most critical aspect of the video: the camera movement. It states the movement is \"smooth\" and \"gradual,\" but the video clearly shows an extremely fast, spinning, and diving motion, characteristic of an FPV (First-Person View) drone.\n*   The description of the initial framing is also incorrect. The crane does not \"dominate\" the frame initially; the sky and a building on the left are more prominent. The crane becomes dominant only as the camera dives toward it.\n*   The statement that the camera \"maintains a high vantage point\" is misleading. While it stays high relative to the ground, its orientation changes dramatically from looking toward the horizon to looking straight down, which is a crucial dynamic the caption misses.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption fails to describe the primary spatial dynamic of the shot, which is the rapid transition from a wide, horizon-level view to a fast-moving, top-down, bird's-eye view of the construction site.\n*   It does not mention the disorienting, spinning nature of the camera movement or the wide-angle lens distortion that is apparent throughout the clip.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   While the caption correctly identifies the subjects and attempts to describe their positions, it fails to \"describe the spatial framing and dynamics\" accurately. The dynamics are the most significant feature of this video, and the caption completely misrepresents them.\n*   It fails to describe how the spatial position \"changes\" correctly, describing a slow shift instead of a rapid dive and reorientation.\n\nIn summary, the caption describes a slow, observational drone shot, but the video is a fast-paced, acrobatic action shot. The description of the movement is the opposite of what is shown, making the caption fundamentally flawed and unsuitable.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video presents a fast-paced, first-person view (FPV) shot of a construction site at sunset, characterized by extreme and disorienting camera movement. Initially, the wide-angle frame captures the vibrant sunset sky, with a tall building visible on the far left. The camera then executes a rapid, spinning dive, causing significant motion blur and perspective distortion. This acrobatic maneuver dramatically shifts the view from the horizon to a direct top-down, bird's-eye perspective. As the camera plummets, a large crane and the construction site below transition from being elements in the wider scene to becoming the central focus, filling the frame as the camera spirals directly towards them. The shot maintains this high-speed descent, ending with a dizzying view looking straight down onto the crane.",
