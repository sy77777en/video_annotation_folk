    "pre_caption": "This is a close-up shot focusing on a woman positioned slightly left of center in the middle ground. In the foreground, the edge of a surface is visible in the bottom right. The background features a wall with red lights towards the top left and center, and a circular sign on the right. During the clip, the woman turns slightly to the right. The camera remains static at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a woman with wavy, shoulder-length hair and a light skin tone. She is wearing glasses and a dark-colored jacket with a green trim. Her expression is cheerful, and she is lifting her glasses upward, suggesting she might be in a social setting. The lighting casts a warm glow, highlighting her features and creating a lively atmosphere.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an indoor setting, likely a dimly lit diner or bar, characterized by warm, ambient lighting with red and yellow hues. The environment features a counter with typical diner elements like condiment bottles. The walls are adorned with retro-style decor, including a prominent logo or sign. The atmosphere suggests a casual, relaxed vibe, with the lighting creating a cozy, intimate feel. The scene remains consistent throughout, maintaining its focus on the interior's nostalgic and inviting ambiance.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The description of the camera movement is inaccurate and contradictory. The caption states the camera is \"panning left and moving to the right,\" but the video shows the camera only pans to the right to follow the subject as she turns her head. The phrase should be corrected to accurately reflect this by stating that the camera pans to the right.",
