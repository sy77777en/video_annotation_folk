    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a boy in the center foreground, suspended in the air with his arms outstretched. Directly below him in the middle ground is a large blue and yellow inflatable object, surrounded by dark green water that fills the background. As the boy is launched higher, the camera, mounted on his head, tilts upward, briefly revealing a background scene with a dock and people in the top right, an inflatable slide in the top left, and a tree-lined shore across the top. The shot then transitions to a medium shot as the camera tilts down, framing the boy's torso in the top center and his legs in the center foreground, with the water and various canoes in the middle ground rushing up to meet him.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young boy with fair skin is launched into the air. He wears a red life vest with grey straps buckled over a sleeveless top, along with grey, white, and turquoise plaid swim trunks. On his head is a black helmet, to which the camera is attached, and a pair of green and blue swimming goggles. As he flies through the air, his arms are outstretched to his sides, and a large blue and yellow inflatable object is visible below him.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot from a helmet-mounted camera captures the experience of being launched into the air from a large, blue and yellow inflatable blob on a body of water. The scene is set on a lake during a sunny day, with a shoreline of dense green trees in the background. Visible in the surrounding water are other recreational items, including canoes, various small buoys, and a large white inflatable slide near a wooden dock where several people are gathered. The water is a calm, dark green, reflecting the clear sky above.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subject’s framing (shot size) is not stable** throughout the video, so the description should emphasize this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is mostly accurate but could be improved for clarity and precision. The opening phrase \"full point-of-view shot of a boy\" is slightly contradictory; it should be rephrased to clarify that it's a POV shot from the boy's perspective that also frames parts of his body, for example, \"a point-of-view shot from a camera on a boy's head, framing his body from the chest down in the center foreground.\" Additionally, when the camera tilts up, the caption could explicitly state that the shot changes to a wide shot of the background scene. Finally, the description of the boy's body in the last sentence, \"framing the boy's torso in the top center and his legs in the center foreground,\" is slightly awkward and could be simplified to \"reframing the boy's torso and legs in the foreground\" for better readability.",
