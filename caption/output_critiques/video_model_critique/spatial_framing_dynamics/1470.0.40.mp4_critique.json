    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot of a man, capturing him from the waist up. Positioned in the foreground and slightly off-center to the left, he holds a blue corded phone to his ear with his right hand while his left hand rests on the door frame. The man stands in the middle ground, with a light wood-colored door directly behind him. To the left of the frame, a vintage-style, light blue wall-mounted telephone is mounted on the wall, adding a retro touch. The background includes a narrow hallway with pale-colored walls and a partially visible room with blinds letting in natural light. As the video progresses, the man closes the door, moving out of the frame. The shot then shifts to a static view of the closed door, now centered in the frame, with the wall-mounted telephone remaining in the same position on the left side. The camera maintains its level position throughout, staying at the subject's height initially and then focusing solely on the door and surrounding area after the subject exits.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man with light skin and short hair, wearing a mustard yellow jacket and dark pants. He is holding a blue corded phone to his ear, standing in a doorway with one hand on the door frame, appearing to be engaged in a conversation. In the background, there is a woman with a towel wrapped around her head, wearing light-colored clothing. As the video progresses, the man closes the door, making him not visible in the frame.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting, specifically a narrow hallway with a light wood-colored door at the end. The environment features pale-colored walls and a vintage-style, light blue wall-mounted telephone with a coiled cord, adding a retro element to the scene. Initially, the door is open, allowing a view of the blinds in the room beyond, with natural light filtering through and casting soft shadows. A man interacts with the telephone and subsequently closes the door, transitioning the scene to a quieter, empty hallway.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects disappearing from the frame**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subject. Then the subject disappears.\n\nBefore the subject disappears, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good for this video. It contains several significant factual inaccuracies and fails to adhere strictly to the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the issues:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **Subject's Position:** The caption states the man is \"Positioned in the foreground and slightly off-center to the left.\" This is incorrect. The man is in the **middle ground**, viewed through a foreground doorway. He is also positioned slightly to the **right** of the center of the frame, not the left.\n*   **Object Interaction:** The caption claims the man \"holds a blue corded phone to his ear.\" This is a major error. The blue phone is mounted on the wall in the foreground/middle ground. The man is holding a different, light-colored (likely beige or white) telephone receiver.\n*   **Hand Usage:** The caption says he holds the phone with his \"right hand.\" In the video, he is clearly holding the receiver to his ear with his **left hand**.\n*   **Spatial Description:** The description of the hallway and room is slightly confusing. The camera is in a hallway looking through a doorway at the man, who is standing in another doorway that leads to a room with blinds. The caption's description of this layout is not clear.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Subjective Language:** The phrase \"adding a retro touch\" is a subjective interpretation, which the instructions explicitly ask to avoid.\n*   **Completeness of Framing:** The caption fails to mention the most important framing element: that the entire scene is viewed through a foreground doorway, which creates a frame-within-a-frame effect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is fundamentally flawed due to multiple, easily verifiable errors regarding the subject's position, actions, and the objects he interacts with. It also violates the instruction to avoid subjective language. Therefore, it is not a good or accurate description of the video.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with a medium shot, viewed from a hallway through a doorway, creating a frame-within-a-frame effect. In the middle ground, a man in a yellow and brown sweater stands in a second doorway, positioned slightly to the right of the frame's center. He holds a light-colored telephone receiver to his left ear with his left hand. To the left, on a pale green wall, a blue, wall-mounted corded telephone is visible. Behind the man, a room with light filtering through window blinds can be seen. The man then closes the door he is standing in, moving out of sight. The shot ends on a static view of the now-closed, light-colored door, with the blue wall-mounted phone remaining on the left. The camera stays stationary and level throughout.",
