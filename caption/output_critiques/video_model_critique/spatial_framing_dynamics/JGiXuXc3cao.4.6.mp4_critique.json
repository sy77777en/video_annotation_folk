    "pre_caption": "A static, high-angle wide shot shows a single, irregularly shaped rock positioned in the center of the frame. The rock rests in the middle ground on a dark, textured surface that extends across the entire frame, from the foreground to the background. The camera remains stationary throughout the shot, maintaining a fixed perspective from above the subject.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A single, light gray, irregularly shaped rock rests in the center of a dark gray, textured surface resembling lunar regolith. The rock is lumpy and somewhat rectangular, with a smooth but contoured surface featuring several indentations and protrusions. The surrounding ground is a darker shade of gray, with a fine, dusty texture and subtle, uneven features. Light appears to be cast from the bottom right, creating shadows that accentuate the three-dimensional form of the rock.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An objective, high-angle shot captures a desolate, monochromatic landscape. The ground is a dark gray, dusty surface, marked by subtle bumps, depressions, and faint linear tracks. Positioned centrally is a single, light-gray object with a smooth, irregular, and lumpy form. The scene is cast in a diffuse light that creates soft shadows and faint, broad light bands across the terrain.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately describes the high-angle shot and the central positioning of the rock. However, the description of the movement could be more specific. While it correctly notes that the camera \"moves slightly,\" it omits the significant visual effect of this movement: a distinct band of light that sweeps across the surface from left to right. A more complete description would mention that the camera slowly tracks sideways, causing this band of light to move across the scene and alter the shadows on the rock.",

The camera slowly tracks sideways, causing a distinct band of light to sweep across the scene from left to right. As the light passes over the rock, it alters the shadows on its surface, emphasizing its bumps and indentations.",
