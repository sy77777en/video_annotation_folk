    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective at eye level, a firearm occupies the foreground at the bottom center and right of the frame. Initially, a dark wall is positioned in the middle ground on the right, with a multi-story building in the middle ground on the left and trees in the background between them. A heads-up display is overlaid, with a mini-map in the bottom left, status indicators in the bottom right, and orange diamond-shaped markers near the center. The view pans to the left, causing the dark wall to move off-screen to the right. Simultaneously, a person lying on the ground comes into view, settling in the bottom left quadrant in the middle ground, while the orange markers shift across the screen in correspondence with the camera's movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person viewpoint, a black, boxy firearm is held, pointing forward. As the camera pans left, a person in military-style camouflage comes into view, lying on their back. A graphical overlay is present, featuring a small, square map with blue and green icons in the lower-left corner. In the lower-right corner, several lines of green letters and numbers are displayed adjacent to the map. Blue text at the center of the frame shows the count of enemies eliminated. Orange, diamond-shaped markers with numbers move across the screen as the camera shifts, apparently tracking specific objects in the video.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a first-person POV, as if through the character’s eyes, the scene is set in a sunlit, outdoor urban area next to a multi-story, predominantly white concrete building with gray on the lower half of the first-floor walls. Instead of large open windows, corridors are visible. The ground is dusty and scattered with rubble, where a figure in combat attire lies. In the background, green, leafy trees, including palms, stand under a bright sky. To the right is a dark, possibly metal, wall with the white stenciled text \"7208-JITE.\" A video game heads-up display (HUD) is overlaid on the scene, featuring a mini-map in the lower left corner, orange diamond-shaped icons near the center, and various status indicators in blue boxes at the lower right corner, including ammunition count and player information. A black firearm is visible in the lower portion of the view.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly describes the initial spatial positions of the main environmental elements. It states the dark wall is on the left and the building is on the right, when the video clearly shows the dark wall is on the right and the building is on the left. Additionally, the caption inaccurately claims the person lying on the ground \"comes into view\" during the camera movement; this person is visible from the start of the video, positioned in the middle ground just left of the center, and then shifts to the bottom left. The description of the wall's movement is also confusing as a result of the initial positioning error. It should state the wall begins on the right and moves off the right edge of the frame as the camera pans left.",
