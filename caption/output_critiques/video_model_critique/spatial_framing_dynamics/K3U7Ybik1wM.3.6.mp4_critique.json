    "pre_caption": "This is a static, wide scenery shot of an attic bedroom, captured from a low camera height with a wide-angle lens, creating a broad and slightly distorted perspective. The sloped ceiling with a dark wooden beam occupies the top left of the frame, leading the eye toward a central skylight in the upper background. In the left background, a bed is partially visible. A wall of white closets is positioned in the center background. In the right middle ground, a wooden desk sits against the wall, with a chair placed in front of it. The scene is framed on the far right by a dark door in the foreground, which enhances the sense of depth, extending from the shadowed foreground to the more distant, illuminated elements of the room.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an interior scenery shot of a dimly lit attic bedroom, characterized by its rustic and cozy atmosphere. The video lacks a main subject, as the static, wide-angle view is intended to capture the overall environment and architectural character of the space. The room features a sloped white ceiling with exposed dark wooden beams and a large, central skylight that provides the main source of natural light, revealing a glimpse of green foliage outside. To the left, a bed with a black metal frame is softly illuminated by a warm bedside lamp. In the background, a wall of simple white closet doors stands opposite a small wooden desk and chair in the right midground, creating a sense of a quiet, lived-in space.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A wide shot captures an attic bedroom with a sloped, white ceiling supported by exposed wooden beams. In the center of the ceiling, a large skylight reveals a glimpse of green foliage against a bright sky. The room has light beige-colored carpeting and white walls. On the left, a bed with a black metal headboard and a small nightstand are slightly blurred. Against the back wall stand tall, white closet doors with simple wooden knobs. To the right, a small wooden desk and a matching chair with a green and yellow patterned cushion are positioned against the wall, next to a white radiator. The room is dimly lit, with a warm glow emanating from the left side, while the right side, including a dark wooden door, remains in shadow.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
