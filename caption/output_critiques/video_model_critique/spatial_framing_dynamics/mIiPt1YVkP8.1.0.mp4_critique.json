    "pre_caption": "A full shot shows a white passenger airplane positioned in the top center of the frame and in the middle ground. Below the aircraft, an illuminated airport runway is located in the bottom center of the frame, stretching into the background. To the left of the runway, in the bottom left background, are the lit buildings of the airport terminal. The scene is viewed from a rear, level perspective relative to the airplane. The shot remains static throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A white passenger airplane is depicted from a rear, slightly elevated perspective against a solid black background. The aircraft has its landing gear extended, showing two sets of wheels beneath its wings, and two engines are visible, one under each wing. Below the plane, an airport is illuminated at night. A long, brightly lit runway, marked with white and green lights, extends into the distance. To the left of the runway, a complex of lit buildings, representing the airport terminal and surrounding structures, is visible. The entire scene is viewed from the air, positioning the airplane as if it is on its final approach for landing.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a rear perspective, a white passenger airplane with its landing gear down descends through a black, starless night sky. Below, an airport runway is brightly illuminated with white lights, creating a clear path for landing. The surrounding airport complex, including taxiways and terminal buildings, is visible as a grid of yellowish and white lights against a vast, dark, and unlit landscape or body of water. The aircraft is positioned centrally, aligned perfectly with the runway as it continues its approach.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly describes camera movement, stating that the camera \"smoothly tracks,\" \"moves forward,\" \"rolls,\" and \"ascends.\" The video is a static shot with no camera movement; it is the airplane that moves away from the stationary camera. The caption also misidentifies the airplane's position in depth, placing it in the \"foreground\" when it is in the middle ground, moving toward the background. The phrase \"enhancing the visual experience\" is subjective and should be removed. To correct this, the description should state that the shot is static and that the airplane moves away from the camera, decreasing in size as it approaches the airport in the background. The airplane should be described as being in the middle ground.",
