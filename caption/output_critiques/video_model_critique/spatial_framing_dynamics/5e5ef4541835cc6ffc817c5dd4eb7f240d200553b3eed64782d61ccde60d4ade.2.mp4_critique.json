    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a full shot of a wolf, capturing its entire body as it lies on a patch of grass. Initially, the wolf is positioned in the center of the frame, with its body oriented towards the left side. In the 2D plane, the wolf occupies the central-left portion of the frame, while in the 3D space, it is in the foreground. The surrounding trees form the middle ground and background, with some trees closer to the wolf and others further away. The camera is at the wolf's level, providing a direct side profile view. As the wolf stands up and moves out of the frame, it exits towards the left, leaving an empty space where it was initially positioned. After the wolf disappears, the shot remains static, focusing on the grassy area and the trees. The remaining scene includes the grass in the foreground, spanning across the bottom of the frame, and the trees in the middle ground and background, filling the rest of the frame. The camera maintains its position at the previous subject's level, continuing to capture the forest setting without any movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a wolf with a thick, grayish-brown fur coat, lying on a patch of grass. The wolf is positioned in a forested area, surrounded by tall trees with green and yellow leaves. Its body is oriented to the left, with its head turned slightly in the same direction, giving a side profile view. The wolf appears calm and relaxed. As the video progresses, the wolf disappears from the frame, leaving only the grassy area and trees visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts a serene outdoor forest setting during the daytime, characterized by tall trees with textured bark and a scattering of autumn leaves. The ground is covered with patches of green grass and fallen leaves, suggesting a natural, undisturbed environment. The lighting is soft, indicating a clear day with sunlight filtering through the trees, casting gentle shadows. The scene focuses on the forest floor and the surrounding trees, maintaining a tranquil and observational perspective throughout.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects disappearing from the frame**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subject. Then the subject disappears.\n\nBefore the subject disappears, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains a few factual inaccuracies and redundancies. First, the wolf is sitting, not lying, at the start of the video. Second, its initial position is on the right side of the frame, not in the center. The phrase 'capturing its entire body' is redundant as 'full shot' already conveys this. Finally, the last two sentences are repetitive and can be significantly condensed; stating that the shot remains static on the scene with grass in the foreground and trees in the background is sufficient, as the camera position and element placement have already been established or are implied by the static nature of the shot.",

It is in the foreground, with trees forming the middle ground and background. The camera is positioned at the wolf's level, capturing a side profile view. The wolf stands up, walks towards the left, and exits the frame. The shot then remains static, showing the empty grassy area in the foreground against the backdrop of the trees.",
