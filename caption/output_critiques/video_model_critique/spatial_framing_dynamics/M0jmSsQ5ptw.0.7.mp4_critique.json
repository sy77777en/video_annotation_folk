    "pre_caption": "This wide shot, filmed from a low angle at the subject's level, captures an outdoor scene with several structures. In the foreground, a low platform with a white ramp extends from the bottom center towards the right, holding a small white ball. A large, A-frame structure is positioned in the middle ground on the left, while a single vertical post stands in the middle ground center, and a large blue backdrop is on the middle ground right. A taut white string initially connects the A-frame structure to the central post. The scene's action begins as the string is released, becoming slack and flying through the center of the frame, while the white ball simultaneously disappears from its position on the ramp in the foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In an outdoor setting, a large, A-frame wooden structure resembling a catapult, with some blue-painted beams, stands on the left. To the right is a translucent dark cloth that allows the blue sky and white clouds to be seen through it. In the foreground, a low structure covered in green artificial turf has a visible layered cross-section of white and tan materials. A white, semi-circular ramp, holding a small white ball, extends from this structure. A single, vertical wooden post rises nearby, connected to the catapult by a taut white string. The white ball rolls down the ramp until it reaches the bottom and strikes a white line, causing the line to loosen and the string to fly loosely through the air, indicating a launch has occurred.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Shot from a low angle, the scene unfolds on a vast, paved expanse under a bright blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds, with distant mountains on the horizon. In the immediate foreground, a ramp made of white pipe leads up to a small platform topped with green artificial turf. A central wooden post supports a white string that is initially taut before it snaps loose and flies through the air. To the left stands a large, A-frame wooden structure with blue-painted elements, and to the right is a large rectangular backdrop, colored blue and orange, with a small red flag at its peak.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly describes the action in the video. It states that a white ball rolls down a ramp and triggers a string to release, but in the video, the ball remains stationary at the top of the ramp throughout the clip. The primary action is the taut white string, stretched from the left structure to the central post, suddenly releasing and becoming slack. The description of the ball's movement and its role in triggering the event is factually inaccurate and should be corrected to describe only the release of the string while noting that the ball on the ramp remains in its initial position.",
