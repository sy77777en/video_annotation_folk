    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot, a female character is positioned in the bottom left foreground, running up a hill toward the center. A tall pillar stands in the center middle ground, with a large, fiery, floating structure in the top right background and mountains spanning the background. The camera, initially at the character's level, follows her as she moves. Upon reaching the crest of the hill, the character jumps forward into the air, moving toward the center of the frame. The camera's perspective shifts to a high angle, looking down on the character as she descends toward the ground in the middle ground, with the base of the pillar directly behind her.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A female video game character with a slender build wears a red and black top, dark pants, and a red headpiece over her dark hair. A long, thin weapon is visible on her back. From the knees down, her legs have an atypical appearance, glowing with a light blue light and appearing to be made of a crystalline substance. Also present is a tall, slender, beige-colored pillar with horizontal brown bands and carved details. A large, floating, fiery structure, resembling an inverted mountain made of orange and yellow crystal, hangs in the sky.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person 3D game video is set in a fantastical, hilly landscape with reddish-brown ground and a forest of red, orange, and green trees. In the background, snow-capped mountains are visible beneath a dramatic, cloudy, turquoise-blue sky. A tall, slender, beige stone tower with carved markings stands prominently in the scene, while a massive, fiery, volcanic landmass floats upside down in the sky, with a blue beam of light extending from it toward the ground. Various white and red targeting icons appear in the environment. The scene includes several overlay elements from a heads-up display: a white horizontal bar and an icon with the number \"2\" are at the bottom of the screen. **\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately describes the character's initial position in the \"bottom left foreground\" and her movement \"toward the center.\" However, the phrase \"moving toward the center of the frame\" after she jumps is redundant, as she has already reached the horizontal center of the frame by that point. Her movement during the jump is primarily forward in depth, from the foreground to the middle ground. A more precise description would be: \"Upon reaching the crest of the hill in the center of the frame, the character jumps forward into the air...\" This change would more accurately reflect her spatial transition without redundancy.",
