    "pre_caption": "This video uses a medium close-up shot, focusing on a man positioned in the center foreground. Behind and above him, a group of silhouetted figures occupies the top center background. Bare tree branches are visible in the top left background. The scene is captured from a low angle, looking up at the main subject. The man leans slightly forward and gestures near his face during the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man with a deep brown skin tone, wearing a dark jacket with bold white text and a light-colored shirt underneath. He has a closely shaved head and a slight mustache. The man is looking directly at the camera with a neutral expression. Above him, a group of people is visible, silhouetted against the sky, standing on a ledge or balcony. The scene suggests an outdoor setting and the individuals in the group are not clearly distinguishable due to the lighting and distance. **\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor urban setting during the day, featuring a group of people gathered on an elevated platform or bridge. The sky is overcast, with bare tree branches visible, suggesting a cool or transitional season. The scene is observed from a low angle, emphasizing the height of the platform and the people silhouetted against the sky. The individuals are dressed in casual attire, with one person prominently in the foreground wearing a black and white jacket with bold black text. The environment conveys a sense of urban architecture.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "**Feedback on the Caption:**\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the shot as a medium close-up, the man's position as center foreground, the silhouetted figures as top center background, and the tree branches as top left background. The description of the low-angle shot and the man's movement (leaning forward, gesturing) is also precise.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is very complete. It successfully covers all the required aspects: shot size, the 2D and 3D positions of all key subjects and elements, the camera's height relative to the subject, and the spatial movement within the shot.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption perfectly follows all instructions. It is a single, concise paragraph written in simple, natural English. It avoids subjective language and speculation, focusing entirely on the objective spatial framing and dynamics of the scene.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is excellent. It is a clear, accurate, and comprehensive description of the video's spatial composition and movement, fully adhering to all the provided guidelines. No changes are needed.",
