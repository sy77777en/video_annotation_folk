    "pre_caption": "A wide shot shows the interior of a greenhouse from a static, low-level perspective. In the foreground and middle ground, dark soil fills the bottom half of the frame, with several black irrigation hoses running horizontally from left to right across the scene. A few wooden planks are placed on the soil, with one in the bottom right foreground and another in the center middle ground. In the background, a large mass of green plants with large leaves occupies the top portion of the frame, stretching from the left to the right side. The arched structure of the greenhouse is visible at the top and sides of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Inside a long, tunnel-shaped greenhouse with a translucent covering, a large patch of lush, green plants with very large, heart-shaped leaves grows at the side away from the camera. These plants have thick vines that spread out from a central point. In the foreground and middle ground, the dark, tilled soil is arranged with several parallel black irrigation hoses running horizontally across the width of the greenhouse. A few flat, light-brown wooden planks are placed intermittently on the soil, perpendicular to the hoses.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A high-angle view from inside a long greenhouse shows a bed of dark soil stretching into the distance. At the far end, a large, sprawling plant with very large, green leaves and thick vines dominates the space. Running horizontally across both the foreground and middleground of the soil bed are several parallel black irrigation hoses. A few flat, light-brown wooden planks are placed intermittently on the soil, perpendicular to the hoses. The structure of the greenhouse, with its arched, translucent covering, is visible at the top of the scene.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is mostly accurate and follows the instructions well. However, the description of the plants could be more precise. Instead of \"a large mass of green plants,\" which suggests multiple individual plants, it should be described as \"a large, vining plant,\" as the video shows a single, extensive vine system dominating the background. Additionally, while the caption mentions \"a few wooden planks,\" it omits the long planks that run along the far left and right sides of the soil bed, framing the central growing area.",
