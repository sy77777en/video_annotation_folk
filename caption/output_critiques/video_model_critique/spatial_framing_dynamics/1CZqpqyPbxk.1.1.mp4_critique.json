    "pre_caption": "The video displays a static screen recording of a video editing software interface. The central area of the frame contains a video clip with a green tint, showing a person holding a camera in profile view. This person is positioned slightly off-center towards the left side of the frame, in the foreground. The camera they hold is also in the foreground, close to their face. The editing software's interface surrounds the video clip, with various controls and tools occupying the top, bottom, and sides of the screen. The color wheels and scopes are located at the bottom, while the timeline and playback controls are situated along the top and bottom edges. There are no changes in the spatial positioning or movement of the elements within the frame throughout the video. The camera angle remains fixed, providing a direct view of the software interface and the video clip being edited. The camera's height relative to the subject cannot be determined from this screen recording.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a screen recording of an image editing app interface, showcasing the editing process of a photograph. The image being edited features a person with short hair, viewed in profile, holding a camera close to their face. The person appears to be concentrating on taking a photograph, with their head slightly tilted forward. The camera is held with both hands, and the person's facial features are partially visible due to the lighting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows a recording of a computer screen with visible UI elements, likely from video editing software. The interface includes various controls and color grading tools, such as color wheels and scopes, displayed prominently at the bottom. The main section features a video clip with a green tint, possibly night vision, showing a person holding a camera. The software interface provides a structured and technical setting. The overall color scheme is dark, with the green-tinted video clip contrasting against the darker interface. The screen's brightness and the software's dark theme suggest a focus on clarity and detail.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on your instructions, here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is mostly accurate in its description of the scene as a static screen recording of video editing software.\n*   The description of the video clip's content (a person in profile with a camera and a green tint) is correct.\n*   The statement, \"The timeline and playback controls are situated along the top and bottom edges,\" is inaccurate. The timeline and playback controls are located in the bottom half of the screen, below the video preview window, not at the top edge.\n*   The claim that \"The camera's height relative to the subject cannot be determined\" is incorrect. While the \"subject\" could be interpreted as the screen itself, the more salient subject is the person in the video clip. The camera that filmed that person is clearly positioned at their eye level. The instructions ask you to describe this if possible, and in this case, it is.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully identifies the main elements (software interface, video clip, controls) and their general placement.\n*   It fails to specify the **shot size** of the person in the video clip (e.g., a close-up), which is a required component of the instructions.\n*   The description of the software layout is too general and, as noted, partially inaccurate. It could be more specific by mentioning the node editor on the right and the media/stills panel on the left.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Spatial Framing:** The caption attempts to describe the spatial framing but creates ambiguity by not clearly distinguishing between the frame of the screen recording and the frame of the video clip being edited (e.g., \"positioned slightly off-center towards the left side of the frame\"). It should specify that the person is positioned this way *within the video clip*.\n*   **Shot Size:** This required element is missing.\n*   **Camera Height:** The caption fails to follow the instruction to describe the camera height relative to the subject, instead incorrectly stating it cannot be determined.\n*   **Dynamics:** The caption correctly identifies and describes the static nature of the video, adhering to this part of the instructions.\n*   **Objectivity:** The caption successfully avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language.\n*   **Format:** The caption adheres to the single-paragraph format without introductory text.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption provides a decent but flawed overview. Its primary weaknesses are the factual inaccuracy regarding the interface layout, the failure to describe the camera height for the person in the clip, the omission of the shot size, and a slight ambiguity in its description of spatial positioning. To be a good caption, it needs to be more precise in its description of the interface and fully address all components of the prompt, particularly shot size and camera height.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A static screen recording shows the interface of the DaVinci Resolve video editing software. In the central preview window, a paused video clip displays a close-up of a person in profile, positioned slightly off-center to the left within their frame. This person is holding a camera up to their face, and the entire clip has a strong green tint to simulate a night vision effect. The camera that filmed the person is at their eye level. Surrounding the preview window are various editing panels: a media and stills panel is on the left, and a node editor is on the right. Below the video preview are the timeline and playback controls, and at the very bottom of the screen are the Color Wheels and Scopes, including a Waveform monitor. The entire view of the software interface remains completely still throughout the video.",
