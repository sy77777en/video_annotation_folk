    "pre_caption": "This video is a scenery shot. The video begins with a wide shot of a Venetian canal, with the water occupying the center and foreground and extending into the background. Buildings line the left and right sides of the frame in the middle ground. The camera, positioned at a low angle close to the water, pans to the left. As the camera moves, a docked vaporetto in the middle ground enters the frame from the right and moves toward the center. The pan concludes by revealing a large church with a wide staircase, which occupies the left side of the frame from the foreground to the middle ground, while the docked vaporetto is now positioned in the right middle ground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a cityscape scenery shot capturing the iconic Grand Canal in Venice on an overcast day. The camera pans left across the choppy, green water, revealing a panorama of historic, multi-story buildings with terracotta roofs lining the canal banks. Various boats populate the scene, including a white and light yellow vaporetto (water bus) labeled \"Actv 26\" carrying passengers, and a smaller wooden motorboat navigating the waterway. The view also includes a grand, ornate white church with wide stone steps leading down to a dock where other water buses are moored. There is no single main subject, as the shot is designed to immerse the viewer in the unique atmosphere and architectural scale of the Venetian environment, emphasizing the city's reliance on its canals.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a scene on the Grand Canal in Venice under an overcast sky. The choppy, greenish water is flanked by historic, multi-story buildings with reddish-brown brick and plaster facades and tiled roofs. On one side, a large, ornate white church with wide steps descends toward the water. Various boats navigate the canal, including a prominent white and light yellow vaporetto, or water bus, with \"Actv 26\" on its side, carrying passengers. Another smaller, classic water taxi is visible further down the canal. People can be seen on the boats and along the waterfront docks.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work. The caption is well-written and adheres closely to the instructions. Here is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is highly accurate in its description of the overall scene, camera movement, and composition.\n*   The identification of the shot as a \"wide shot\" of a \"Venetian canal\" is correct.\n*   The description of the camera's \"low angle close to the water\" and its \"pan to the left\" is precise.\n*   The final framing of the church on the left and the vaporetto on the right is also correct.\n*   There is one minor point of inaccuracy: The phrase \"a docked vaporetto... enters the frame from the right and moves toward the center\" is slightly confusing. The vaporetto is stationary on the left bank of the canal. As the camera pans left, the vaporetto is revealed and appears to move across the frame from right to left relative to the frame's edges. A clearer description might be: \"As the camera pans left, it reveals a docked vaporetto on the left, which then moves across the frame towards the right as the pan continues.\"\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is very complete. It successfully describes the shot size, the 2D and 3D positions of key elements (water, buildings, church, vaporetto), the camera's height and movement, and the change in composition resulting from the pan.\n*   It effectively captures the initial, transitional, and final states of the scene's spatial framing.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   The caption perfectly follows the stylistic and structural guidelines.\n*   It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown.\n*   It uses simple, natural, and objective language, avoiding emotional or speculative terms.\n*   It focuses entirely on the spatial framing and dynamics as requested.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe caption is excellent and demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions. It provides a clear, concise, and accurate spatial description of the video. The only area for minor improvement is clarifying the relative motion of the vaporetto as the camera pans.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a wide shot of a Venetian canal, with the water occupying the center and foreground and extending into the background. Buildings line the left and right sides of the frame in the middle ground. The camera, positioned at a low angle close to the water, pans to the left. As the camera pans, it reveals a stationary vaporetto docked on the left bank; due to the camera's movement, this boat appears to enter the frame from the right and move across it. The pan concludes by revealing a large church with a wide staircase, which occupies the left side of the frame from the foreground to the middle ground, while the docked vaporetto is now positioned in the right middle ground.",
