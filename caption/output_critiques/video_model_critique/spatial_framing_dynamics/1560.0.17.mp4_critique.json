    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot capturing a young man walking through a snowy park. Initially, the man is positioned slightly off-center to the left in the foreground, moving towards the right side of the frame. As he progresses, his position shifts closer to the center, maintaining a consistent distance from the camera. The man remains in the foreground throughout the video, while the background features a row of hedges and leafless trees lining the path. Two individuals dressed in dark clothing are seated on a bench located in the middle ground, positioned towards the right side of the frame. The buildings with arched doorways are situated in the background, spanning the width of the scene. The camera maintains a steady height at the subject's level, ensuring the man and surrounding elements remain clearly visible. There are no significant changes in shot size or camera angle, keeping the spatial composition stable and focused on the man's movement across the snowy path.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a young man walking through a snowy park. He has light skin and short hair, and he is wearing a brown jacket, blue jeans, and brown shoes. He carries a black backpack on both shoulders. The man is walking along a path lined with leafless trees and a hedge. Not far away, there are two people dressed in dark clothing seated on a bench. The setting is serene, with snow covering the ground and the branches of the trees.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor winter scene in a park-like setting, featuring snow-covered ground and bare trees with a light dusting of snow on their branches. The environment includes a row of hedges and light brown multi-story buildings in the background, with numerous arched doorways on the ground floor. The sky is overcast in daytime, with diffused lighting creating a soft, muted atmosphere. A few benches are placed along a path, and the snow adds a uniform white layer across the landscape. The scene is calm, with minimal movement, as one individual walks along the path, dressed in winter clothing.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe caption is very good. It is well-structured, detailed, and adheres closely to the instructions. It successfully describes the spatial framing, subject movement, and composition of the scene in a clear and concise manner.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **Highly Accurate:** The description of the shot size (wide shot), the main subject's movement (walking from left to right), his 2D position (starting left of center, moving towards the center), the camera height (subject's level), and the stability of the shot are all accurate.\n*   **Minor Inaccuracy:** The caption states the \"background features a row of hedges and leafless trees.\" This is slightly inaccurate in terms of depth layering. The hedges and trees are more precisely located in the **middle ground**, along with the bench. The large building behind them is in the **background**. The caption correctly identifies the building's position later, but the initial placement of the hedges is slightly off.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is very complete. It successfully addresses all the required elements from the instructions:\n    *   **Shot Size:** \"wide shot\"\n    *   **Position (2D & 3D):** It correctly identifies the 2D positions (left, right, center) and 3D positions (foreground, middle ground, background) for the main subject, secondary subjects (people on the bench), and key environmental elements (hedges, trees, building).\n    *   **Height:** \"at the subject's level\"\n    *   **Changes/Dynamics:** It describes the man's movement across the frame and correctly notes the lack of significant changes in shot size or angle.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Excellent:** The caption perfectly follows the instructions to be a single, coherent paragraph, use simple and natural English, and avoid subjective language or speculation. It focuses entirely on the spatial and dynamic aspects of the shot as requested.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis is an excellent caption that fulfills almost all requirements of the prompt. The only point for improvement is to be more precise with the depth terminology, specifically by placing the hedges and trees in the middle ground rather than the background. Otherwise, it is a model example of the requested analysis.",
