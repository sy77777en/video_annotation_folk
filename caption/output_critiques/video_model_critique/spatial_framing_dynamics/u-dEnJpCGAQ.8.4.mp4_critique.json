    "pre_caption": "This video features an extreme wide shot of a landscape from a high angle. Initially, the scene is framed by green foliage in the foreground on the left and right sides. A dark-water lake is positioned in the center of the middle ground, surrounded by a dense forest. In the background, a large, forest-covered mountain occupies the top half of the frame. The camera slowly moves forward, causing the foreground elements to gradually shift toward the edges of the frame. This movement opens up the view, making the centrally located lake and the surrounding middle-ground forest more prominent, while the background mountain remains a constant element.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a landscape scenery shot, capturing a serene, dark-water lake nestled within a lush, green forest. The still surface of the lake reflects the sky and the dense foliage that lines its shores, while a large, forest-covered mountain looms in the background under a bright sky. The scene is framed by vibrant green leaves and branches in the foreground, creating a sense of depth and perspective. There is no single main subject, as the focus is intentionally placed on the expansive and tranquil atmosphere of the natural environment, emphasizing the scale and pristine beauty of the remote location.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone moves slowly forward over a lush, green forest, revealing a secluded lake nestled in a valley. The calm, mirror-like water of the lake reflects the sky and the dense, verdant trees that encircle its shores. In the background, a large mountain, also covered in a thick blanket of green forest, rises into the sky, with parts of its slope illuminated by sunlight. The foreground is filled with the vibrant green leaves of various trees and shrubs, framing the view of the tranquil valley and the surrounding trees. Small patches of grassy vegetation are visible along the edges and within the body of the water.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
