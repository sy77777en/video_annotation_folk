    "pre_caption": "A medium shot frames a woman from the waist up, positioned in the center-right of the frame. She stands in the foreground against a large, geometric blue backdrop that fills the background. As she speaks, she takes a small step to her right, shifting her position slightly toward the center-left of the frame. The camera remains static and is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A middle-aged white woman with shoulder-length brown hair and bangs moves towards the left side of the frame as she speaks. She is wearing a dark, patterned, sleeveless V-neck top with a small microphone clipped to the neckline. She accessorizes with a simple necklace, a watch, and a ring on her left hand. She gestures with her hands while talking, holding a small black object, possibly a presentation remote, in her right hand.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A woman stands on a stage in front of a large, geometric backdrop. The background is composed of angular, overlapping planes illuminated in vibrant shades of deep blue. The lighting is focused on the center of the stage, creating a distinct contrast with the dark blue environment. The woman is wearing a dark, sleeveless dress and is gesturing as she speaks.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

In the video, the woman remains in the center of the frame, and the camera shot is static. The caption also omits the camera's height relative to the subject.
