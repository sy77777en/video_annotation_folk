    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide, eye-level scenery shot looking down a hallway. A door is positioned in the center of the frame in the background, at the far end of the corridor. A light fixture is located in the top center, directly above the door, and a window is on the left wall in the middle ground. Initially, the light fixture casts a red glow that illuminates the entire scene. The red light then turns off, leaving the hallway in near-complete darkness, with only a faint light emanating from the window on the left.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents an atmospheric interior scenery shot of a desolate hallway. At the far end, a closed door stands beneath a light fixture that initially bathes the entire corridor in an intense, ominous red glow. This alarming light flickers and then abruptly shuts off, plunging the scene into near-complete darkness. The only remaining illumination is a faint, cool light filtering through a paned window on the left wall, leaving the hallway looking cold and mysterious. The focus is not on a particular subject but on the environment itself, using the dramatic shift from a threatening red to a desolate darkness to build a powerful sense of suspense and unease.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a narrow, dimly lit hallway with light-colored tiled floors and dark, paneled walls. At the far end of the corridor, a single door with a vertical window is positioned centrally. Above this door, a rectangular light fixture casts an intense red glow, illuminating the space and reflecting off the walls. On the left wall, a multi-paned window emits a contrasting cool, white light with a subtle hint of pale blue. The scene transitions as the red light abruptly turns off, plunging the hallway into darkness, with only the faint, cool light from the window remaining.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption omits the dark walls in the foreground that frame the shot, which is a key element of the scene's spatial composition. To improve the description of depth, you should add this detail. For instance, modify the first sentence to: \"This video presents a wide, eye-level scenery shot looking down a hallway, framed by dark walls in the foreground.\" Additionally, the phrase \"leaving the hallway in near-complete darkness\" is slightly subjective. A more objective description would be to state that \"the scene becomes dark,\" so the final sentence should be changed to: \"The red light then turns off, and the scene becomes dark, with only a faint light emanating from the window on the left.\"",
