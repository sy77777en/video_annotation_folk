    "pre_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a landscape, captured from a low-angle perspective moving forward. The cracked asphalt road originates at the bottom of the frame and recedes toward a central vanishing point on the horizon, acting as a leading line. In the background, a range of snow-capped mountains spans the horizon across the upper portion of the frame. The middle ground is occupied by an arid plain on the left and right sides of the road. As the camera advances, the road and the immediate scrubland in the foreground and middle ground move past and out of the frame, while the mountains in the background remain relatively fixed. A yellow road sign briefly appears in the middle ground on the right, and a single car is visible in the middle ground, centered on the road and moving away from the camera. A lens flare is present in the top right of the frame, and the clear sky fills the top third of the composition.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a landscape scenery shot, captured from the perspective of a vehicle moving along a long, cracked asphalt road. The road stretches into the distance, leading the eye toward a majestic range of snow-capped mountains illuminated by the warm, golden light of either sunrise or sunset. The surrounding terrain is an arid plain covered in low, dry brush under a clear blue sky. There is no main subject, as the composition is designed to emphasize the vast scale of the natural environment and evoke the feeling of a journey through an open, expansive landscape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A forward-moving view travels along a straight, two-lane asphalt road through an arid landscape. The road's surface is dark and covered in a network of black, crack-sealing tar lines. On the horizon, a range of tall, jagged mountains with white snow-covered peaks is bathed in an orange glow, illuminated by the warm, golden light set against a clear blue sky. The surrounding terrain is a flat expanse of dry, brown scrubland. A reddish-orange lens flare is visible on the right, and a yellow road sign with a bicycle symbol stands on the shoulder. Evenly spaced roadside poles line both sides of the road, and the highway features white and yellow painted lines. A single car can be seen driving ahead in the distance.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
