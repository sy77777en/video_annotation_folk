    "pre_caption": "This static medium close-up shot is framed from an over-the-shoulder perspective, with the back of a figure's head occupying the right foreground. The main subject, a silver, featureless humanoid figure, is positioned in the center-middle ground, standing behind a counter. To the left of this central figure is a display of chocolate, while to the right are shelves holding candy and other items, all located in the middle ground. A brick wall and additional shelving are visible in the background. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A humanoid figure with a smooth, reflective, silver head devoid of any facial features is shown from the chest up. The figure wears a light blue, collared button-down shirt and a light gray tie. Its hands, which are also silver and metallic, are held up with the palms facing upward in a presentational gesture. To the right, the back of a second figure's head and neck is partially visible, appearing as a dark, indistinct shape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From an over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned in front of one character and behind another, showing the first one's upper body, the second one's back of the head and neck, and the scene ahead, the scene is set inside a small, artificially lit shop. A figure with a featureless, metallic silver head and hands stands behind a wooden counter, wearing a light blue shirt and a white tie. The background features a brick wall and various product displays. On the counter, there are two smaller displays: a turquoise shelf holding boxes of chocolate labeled \"Cacao\" and another display on the right containing colorful boxes of candy. Behind the counter, there are larger displays. An overlay at the bottom-left of the screen displays a white text caption \"[4].\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is mostly accurate but can be improved for clarity. The phrase \"standing in front of a counter\" is ambiguous. To more accurately describe the spatial relationship, it should be changed to \"standing behind a counter,\" as the counter is positioned between the main subject and the viewer's perspective.",
