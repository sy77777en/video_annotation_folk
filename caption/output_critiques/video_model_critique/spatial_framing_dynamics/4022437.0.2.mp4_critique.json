    "pre_caption": "This close-up shot begins with a silver car wheel in the foreground, positioned in the right and center of the frame. To the left, in the middle ground, the black car body and an open rear door are visible, revealing a tan leather seat and a sunroof at the top left. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, slowly trucks left and pushes in, causing the wheel to shift to the far-right edge of the frame. This movement transitions the focus to the car's interior, bringing the open doorway and the tan seat back to the center and left of the frame in the middle ground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a detailed view of the rear left wheel of a car. The large, silver, five-spoke alloy wheel features Mercedes-Benz and AMG badges, and the branding \"CONTINENTAL\" is visible on the black rubber tire. Behind the wheel spokes, a silver brake disc and a darker brake caliper can be seen. Part of the car's roof, including a sunroof, is also visible.  The camera slowly moves upward and trucks to the left, transitioning its focus to the car's interior. The rear passenger door is open, revealing a tan leather interior, specifically the back of a front seat with a storage pocket. **\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video begins with a close-up of the rear wheel, showcasing a silver, five-spoke alloy rim with a Mercedes-Benz center cap on a black tire. As the camera slowly pushes in, the focus transitions smoothly to the car's interior through the open rear passenger door, revealing the tan leather seats, the back of a front seat with a storage pocket, and a sunroof in the ceiling, all set outdoors on an asphalt surface during the day.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption's description of the initial position of the wheel as \"in the right and center of the frame\" is slightly inaccurate; it is more accurately positioned on the right side of the frame. Additionally, the camera height is described as \"at the subject's level,\" which is vague. A more precise description would be \"at a low angle, level with the wheel.\" Finally, the phrase \"transitions the focus to the car's interior, bringing...\" is slightly redundant; simply stating that the movement \"brings the open doorway and the tan seat back to the center and left\" would be more concise and direct.",
