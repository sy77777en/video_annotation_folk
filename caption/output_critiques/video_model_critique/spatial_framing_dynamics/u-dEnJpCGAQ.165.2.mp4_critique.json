    "pre_caption": "This wide shot captures a group of elephants in the middle ground, positioned across the bottom half of the frame from the center-left to the right. The elephants are moving slowly as a group from right to left across the scene. The bottom half of the frame is filled with golden savanna grass that extends from the foreground into the middle ground. In the background, a hazy, distant landscape with a few scattered trees sits on the horizon, while the top half of the frame is occupied by a pale blue sky. The camera is static and positioned at a height slightly above the subjects, looking down on them from a distance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a group of elephants in a grassy savanna. The elephants, varying in size, are dark gray and appear to be grazing. They are walking from right to left across the scene, with the elephant at the very back appearing to be of similar size to the one at the front, while the elephant in the middle seems smaller. The setting is open and expansive, suggesting a natural habitat. The elephants are the primary subjects, and their presence is consistent throughout the video.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a serene outdoor setting in a vast savanna landscape under a clear sky. The time of day appears to be midday, with bright, even lighting illuminating the scene. The expansive grassland stretches into the distance, characterized by tall, golden grasses swaying gently in the breeze. Scattered acacia trees dot the horizon, adding to the open, natural environment. A group of elephants is present, grazing and moving slowly across the terrain, their dark silhouettes contrasting against the lighter grasses. The overall atmosphere is calm and undisturbed, with the elephants' presence adding a sense of life and movement to the tranquil landscape.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
