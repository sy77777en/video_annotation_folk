    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a silver laptop placed on a wooden surface, capturing most of the laptop along with part of the surrounding area. The laptop is positioned in the center of the frame, with its screen displaying a digital map interface. The keyboard is visible in the foreground, while the wooden surface occupies the bottom portion of the frame. As the video progresses, the camera gradually zooms in, transitioning from a medium shot to a close-up shot. This change in shot size focuses more on the laptop screen, which now nearly fills the entire frame. The map on the screen shifts slightly to the right as a sidebar appears on the left side, providing additional information. The camera remains positioned above the laptop throughout, maintaining a consistent angle that captures the screen and keyboard. The wooden surface remains in the background, though less prominent due to the closer framing. There are no significant changes in the camera's height relative to the laptop; it stays above the subject, ensuring a clear view of the screen's content.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases a silver laptop with a sleek design, initially open on a wooden surface. The screen shows the digital map interface with detailed geographical features, including roads, rivers, and green areas representing parks or forests. The map displays various locations and routes, with a blue line indicating a specific path or direction. The keyboard of the laptop is visible initially, but as the camera zooms in, the screen nearly fills the entire frame. The screen also includes a sidebar with additional information such as location details and navigation options, highlighting its use for navigation or route planning.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows an indoor setting with a focus on a laptop placed on a wooden table. The lighting is bright, but it does not specifically indicate the time of day. The laptop screen displays a digital map interface with detailed geographical features like roads, rivers, and urban areas. The map quickly zooms out to reveal a wider view, then a sidebar appears on the left side. After this, a route is prominently highlighted in blue on the map. The laptop is silver with a black keyboard, and the table has a natural wood grain texture. The setting is simple, with minimal additional elements visible, emphasizing the digital map on the laptop screen.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is mostly accurate but can be improved for precision and completeness. The description of the laptop's position as \"in the center\" is imprecise; it is positioned diagonally across the frame. The description of the wooden surface is also confusing, as it is the ground plane for the entire scene, not just in the \"bottom portion\" or \"background.\" The caption omits the notebook visible in the top-left foreground at the start. It also fails to mention all the spatial changes happening on the screen itself, such as the map zooming out and a route being drawn, which are key dynamic elements within the frame. Finally, the last sentence, \"There are no significant changes in the camera's height relative to the laptop; it stays above the subject, ensuring a clear view of the screen's content,\" is redundant, as the camera's consistent high-angle position is already mentioned. This sentence should be removed to improve conciseness.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a medium, high-angle shot of a silver laptop positioned diagonally on a wooden table. In the top-left foreground, a small notebook and pen are also visible. The camera gradually zooms in, transitioning to a close-up that focuses on the laptop's screen, which displays a digital map of the Portland, Oregon area. As the zoom continues, the map on the screen itself zooms out to reveal a wider geographical area. A context menu appears on the map, followed by a sidebar on the left side of the screen. A route is then plotted from \"Northeast Portland\" to \"Mt Hood Village,\" and a blue line is drawn on the map to illustrate the path, with travel details appearing in the sidebar. The camera maintains its high-angle perspective throughout the shot.",
