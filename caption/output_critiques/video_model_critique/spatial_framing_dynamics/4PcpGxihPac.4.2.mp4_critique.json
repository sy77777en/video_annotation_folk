    "pre_caption": "In a static close-up shot, a woman's face occupies the top-right portion of the frame, positioned in the foreground. Her head is tilted, resting on a surface that extends across the bottom of the frame. The left side of the frame is entirely dark and empty. The camera is positioned at her level, capturing her from a slightly low angle as she looks toward the top-left.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a very dark, blue-lit scene, the face of a light-skinned woman is shown in a close-up. Her head is tilted, resting on a surface, and she looks upward with wide, dark eyes. Her expression is tense, with a slight frown and her mouth slightly open. Her hair is dark and partially visible around her face.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a nearly black environment, a person's face is partially illuminated by a strong blue light, creating an atmosphere reminiscent of a lightning storm with alternating light and darkness. The individual is lying on a soft, textured surface that is mostly obscured by shadow, and the scene is characterized by its dark, monochromatic blue color scheme.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work. The caption is highly accurate, complete, and adheres perfectly to all instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n- The description of the shot as a \"static close-up\" is precise.\n- The placement of the woman's face in the \"top-right portion of the frame\" and in the \"foreground\" is correct.\n- The detail about her head being \"tilted, resting on a surface\" and the surface extending \"across the bottom of the frame\" is accurate.\n- The observation that the \"left side of the frame is entirely dark and empty\" correctly describes the use of negative space.\n- The analysis of the camera position (\"at her level, capturing her from a slightly low angle\") and her gaze (\"looks toward the top-left\") is spot-on.\n\n**Completeness:**\n- The caption successfully addresses all required elements: shot size, 2D position, 3D depth, camera height/angle, and the absence of movement.\n- It provides a comprehensive spatial understanding of the scene within a single, concise paragraph.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n- The caption is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English.\n- It strictly avoids emotional or subjective language (e.g., \"scared,\" \"eerie\") and speculative statements.\n- It focuses entirely on the objective spatial framing and composition as requested.\n\nThe caption is an exemplary execution of the provided guidelines.",
