    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium close-up shot of a man walking through an industrial or greenhouse-like environment. The subject occupies the central portion of the frame, with his upper body and face clearly visible. He moves forward steadily, remaining in the foreground while the background consists of glass walls, metal structures, and overhead piping. The camera maintains a consistent position at the subject's eye level, capturing his movement from the front. As he walks, his position shifts slightly within the frame, but he remains centered. The background elements, such as the glass ceiling and metal framework, stay static, providing a sense of depth and context to the scene. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or camera angle throughout the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man with a medium build and light skin tone, wearing a dark blue suit, a white dress shirt, and a striped tie. He has short, gray hair and a full beard. His expression is neutral, and he is walking purposefully through a large, industrial-looking space with a glass ceiling and visible metal structures. The setting suggests a modern, possibly industrial or greenhouse environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an indoor setting within a modern greenhouse or industrial facility, characterized by a high, transparent ceiling made of glass panels supported by a metal framework. The environment is well-lit, with natural light streaming through the ceiling, suggesting daytime. The space is filled with an array of pipes and metal structures, some of which run parallel to the ceiling, contributing to an industrial aesthetic. The walls are lined with large glass windows, and the floor is a smooth, reflective surface. The overall color scheme is a mix of metallic grays and blues, with occasional warm tones from the lighting. The scene remains static, with no significant changes in weather or lighting, maintaining a consistent, structured atmosphere throughout.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description of the shot size as a \"medium close-up\" is slightly inaccurate. The shot shows the man from the mid-torso up, which is more characteristic of a **medium shot**. A medium close-up typically frames a person from the shoulders up.\n*   The statement that \"The background elements... stay static\" is incorrect. This is a significant error. The camera is tracking backward as the man walks forward, causing the background elements (pipes, walls, structures) to move or \"scroll\" past him from the perspective of the viewer. This movement is a key dynamic of the scene.\n*   The phrase \"his position shifts slightly within the frame, but he remains centered\" is slightly contradictory. It's more accurate to simply state that he remains centered in the frame.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully identifies the subject, his position (center, foreground), the camera height (eye level), and the general composition of the background.\n*   However, it fails to fully describe the **dynamics** of the shot as required by the instructions. It mentions the man is walking but omits the crucial detail that the camera is moving backward in sync with him (a tracking shot). This omission leads to the inaccurate description of the background as static. A complete description would explain this camera movement and the resulting parallax effect, where the background appears to move past the subject.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   The caption adheres well to the stylistic guidelines: it is a single paragraph, uses simple and objective language, and avoids speculation or emotional adjectives.\n*   It correctly attempts to describe shot size, position (2D and 3D), and camera height.\n*   The primary failure is in not accurately or completely describing the \"spatial dynamics\" and \"changes\" as the instructions emphasize. By missing the camera's tracking movement and mischaracterizing the background, it fails to capture the essential motion within the shot.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a good attempt but contains a critical inaccuracy regarding the movement of the background, which stems from not identifying the camera's tracking motion. Correcting this and refining the shot size description would make it fully compliant with the instructions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is a medium shot of a man in a suit walking through a large, industrial greenhouse. The camera tracks backward, keeping pace with him as he walks directly toward the viewer. He remains centered in the frame, shown from the mid-torso up, and the camera is positioned at his eye level. As a result of the camera's backward tracking motion, the background—consisting of glass walls, a complex network of overhead pipes, and other structural elements—continuously moves past him, creating a sense of depth and forward momentum. The shot size and angle remain constant throughout the sequence.",
