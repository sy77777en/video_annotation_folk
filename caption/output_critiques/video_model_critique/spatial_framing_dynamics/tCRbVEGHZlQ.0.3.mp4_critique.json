    "pre_caption": "This full shot centers on a black stick figure standing in the middle ground. The figure is positioned on a black horizontal line that runs along the bottom of the frame, with sparse tufts of green grass scattered in the foreground. Initially, the character holds an orange object to its head with its left arm, which is bent. The figure then lowers its arm to its side. The camera remains static and positioned at the subject's height throughout the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A black stick figure character is depicted with a round head, a thin torso, and slender limbs. The character is holding an orange phone, making a call, and then lowers its hand.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a minimalist, two-dimensional animated scene set against a plain white background, a single black horizontal line delineates the ground. Scattered along this line are a few sparse tufts of dark green, sketch-like grass. A black stick figure stands on this surface, holding an orange phone. The character makes a call and then lowers its hand. The overall style is stark and simple, with the environment defined by these few elements.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains factual inaccuracies regarding the subject's appearance and actions. The character does not hold an orange phone; the orange elements are markings on its face, and its initial pose is contemplative with its hand on its chin. Furthermore, the figure does not lower its arm to its side but instead crosses both arms over its chest. The caption also omits the required shot size and the subject's specific position within the frame. To improve the caption, it should be corrected to state that in a full shot, a black stick figure with orange facial markings stands in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. The description of the action should be changed to: \"Initially, the character has its left hand on its chin, then lowers it to cross both arms over its chest.\"",
