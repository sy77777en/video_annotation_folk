    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of an indoor urban setting, capturing a long, covered walkway with a sleek, contemporary design. The camera remains at eye level throughout, providing a consistent perspective of the environment. Initially, the walkway stretches into the background, with the ceiling's exposed beams and smooth flooring dominating the upper and lower portions of the frame. On the right side, large windows or glass walls reveal well-lit interiors, likely shops or restaurants, situated in the middle ground. As the video progresses, the camera moves forward, bringing a blue fabric banner with white text into clearer view on the right side, hanging near the center-right of the frame. This banner is positioned in the foreground, accompanied by a digital display board showing images, suggesting a restaurant entrance. To the left, decorative elements like potted plants and wooden benches are placed along the walkway, adding greenery and warmth to the scene. An escalator is visible further back on the left side, enhancing the modern feel of the space. The camera's movement is smooth, maintaining a steady pace as it transitions from the initial wide view of the walkway to a closer focus on the banner and display board. The watermark \"VIRTUAL JAPAN.TV\" remains consistently in the lower left corner,",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an urban scenery shot. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere of the indoor space, highlighting architectural elements and ambient lighting rather than a specific object or subject. The composition emphasizes the overall setting and mood.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a first-person POV, takes place in an indoor setting resembling a modern shopping or dining area. The environment features a long, covered walkway with a sleek, contemporary design. The ceiling is lined with exposed beams, and the floor is smooth and clean. On one side, large windows or glass walls reveal brightly lit interiors that appear to be restaurants, as indicated by an illuminated advertising stand near the entrance. Decorative elements like potted plants and wooden benches are placed along the walkway, adding a touch of greenery and warmth. An escalator is visible in the scene, enhancing the modern feel of the area. Notable visual elements include a blue fabric banner with white text and a digital display board showing images, suggesting a restaurant entrance. Overlay elements, such as a watermark reading \"VIRTUAL JAPAN.TV,\" are present in the lower corner, indicating the video’s source.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption.\n\n**Feedback:**\n\nThe caption is generally accurate and quite comprehensive in its description of the scene's elements and the camera's movement. However, it fails to adhere strictly to several key negative constraints outlined in the instructions, particularly regarding subjectivity and speculation.\n\n**Accuracy & Completeness:**\n*   **Good:** The caption correctly identifies the shot as a \"wide shot\" and the camera height as \"eye level.\"\n*   **Good:** It accurately describes the main components of the scene: the walkway, ceiling, floor, the shopfront on the right (banner, display board), elements on the left (benches, plants, escalator), and the watermark.\n*   **Good:** The description of the camera's forward movement and the resulting shift in focus from a general view to the shopfront is well-articulated.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption violates several specific instructions:\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":**\n    *   \"...a sleek, contemporary design.\" (\"Sleek\" and \"contemporary\" are subjective interpretations of the style.)\n    *   \"...adding greenery and warmth to the scene.\" (\"Warmth\" is an emotional, subjective quality.)\n    *   \"...enhancing the modern feel of the space.\" (\"Enhancing the feel\" is a subjective assessment.)\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid speculative statements\":**\n    *   \"...likely shops or restaurants...\" (This is an assumption about the nature of the interiors.)\n    *   \"...suggesting a restaurant entrance.\" (This is an inference about the function of the banner and display, not a direct observation.)\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid ambiguous options like 'A or B'\":**\n    *   \"...large windows or glass walls...\" (The instruction is to describe what is visible without ambiguity. \"Glass walls\" would be a more direct description.)\n\n*   **Minor Issues:**\n    *   The phrase \"decorative elements\" is an interpretation of the items' purpose rather than a direct description of what they are (plants and benches).\n    *   The caption ends with a comma, making the final sentence grammatically incomplete.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile the caption successfully describes the spatial framing and dynamics in terms of what is present and how it moves, it needs significant revision to remove all subjective, speculative, and interpretive language. The goal is to create a purely objective, descriptive account of the visual information, and this caption frequently crosses the line into analysis and interpretation, which the instructions explicitly forbid.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video presents a wide, eye-level shot of a long, covered indoor walkway. The ceiling has exposed horizontal beams, and the floor is a smooth, light-colored surface. On the right, a storefront with large glass panels reveals a lit interior. To the left of the walkway is a metal railing, alongside which are wooden cube-shaped seats and potted plants. Further in the background on the left, an escalator is visible. The camera moves forward at a steady pace along the walkway. As it advances, a blue fabric banner with white text inside a circle, hanging in front of the storefront entrance on the right, comes into focus. Next to the entrance are two lit A-frame signs. The watermark \"VIRTUAL JAPAN.TV\" is located in the lower-left corner of the frame.",
