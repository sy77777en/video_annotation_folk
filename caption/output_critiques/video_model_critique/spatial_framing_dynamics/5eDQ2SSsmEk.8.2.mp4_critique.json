    "pre_caption": "The video features an extreme close-up shot of a man's face, focusing primarily on his mouth and beard. The shot size remains consistent throughout, capturing only a small portion of the subject's face. The man's face occupies the left side of the frame, with his beard prominently displayed in the foreground. A hand, positioned on the right side of the frame, holds food and moves towards the man's mouth. This hand is also in the foreground, interacting directly with the subject. The background consists of softly blurred circular bokeh lights, indicating a dimly lit environment, and is situated in the middle ground behind the subject. The camera maintains a level height relative to the subject, ensuring the focus remains on the interaction between the hand and the man's mouth. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial position; the framing stays tight on the subject's face and the hand throughout the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features an extreme close-up of a man's face, focusing on his mouth and beard. The man has a thick beard with stringy, sticky food caught in it, suggesting he is in the middle of eating. His lips briefly open to take a bite and then close afterward. In this video, a hand, possibly the man's own, is seen holding the food as he brings it to his mouth. As he bites the food, the extreme close-up captures the detailed strands of his beard and the sticky texture of the food.  The lighting casts a dramatic effect, with a mix of red and blue tones, creating a striking visual contrast.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a close-up view of a bearded face in a dimly lit environment, possibly outdoors at night. The setting features a cool color palette with blue and red lighting, creating a moody atmosphere. The beard appears wet with visible droplets, likely due to stringy, sticky food caught in it, suggesting the individual is in the midst of eating. A hand interacts with the beard by holding a piece of food and bringing it to the person's mouth, adding a dynamic element. The background is softly blurred with circular bokeh lights, enhancing the focus on the foreground details.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is highly accurate in its description of the core visual elements. It correctly identifies the shot as an \"extreme close-up,\" the subject as a \"man's face,\" and the key elements as the \"mouth and beard,\" a \"hand,\" and \"bokeh lights.\"\n*   The description of the hand's movement \"towards the man's mouth\" is also correct.\n*   The one minor point of potential inaccuracy is the use of the word \"food.\" While it is a reasonable inference, the object is not clearly identifiable. To be strictly compliant with the instruction to \"avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain,\" it would be more precise to describe it as \"a dark object.\"\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is very complete and successfully addresses all the required components from the instructions.\n*   It specifies the **shot size** (\"extreme close-up\").\n*   It details the **2D position** of the elements (face on the \"left,\" hand on the \"right\").\n*   It describes the **3D position/depth** (face and hand in the \"foreground,\" lights in the \"middle ground/background\").\n*   It notes the **camera's height** (\"level height relative to the subject\").\n*   It correctly observes and describes the **spatial dynamics**, noting the hand's movement and the overall static nature of the frame.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths:** The caption adheres well to the core instructions. It is a single, coherent paragraph, uses simple and objective language, and avoids emotional adjectives. It focuses entirely on spatial framing and dynamics as requested.\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   **Speculation:** As mentioned, using \"food\" is a minor speculative leap.\n    *   **Precision of Terms:** The caption describes the background lights as being in the \"middle ground.\" In a shot with such a shallow depth of field, where there are only two distinct planes (the subject and the blurred background), it is more accurate to label the lights as being in the **background**. There is no discernible middle ground.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is excellent and demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions. It is well-structured, detailed, and largely accurate. The feedback points are minor refinements rather than significant errors. By replacing \"food\" with \"an object\" and \"middle ground\" with \"background,\" the caption would be a perfect execution of the prompt.",
