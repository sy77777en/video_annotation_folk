    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of an indoor architectural scene, focusing on a descending escalator. The camera captures the full length of the escalator, which occupies the central portion of the frame, extending from the foreground into the background. The escalator's handrails and steps are clearly visible, with the steps moving downward. On either side of the escalator, metal railings run parallel, positioned in the middle ground. These railings extend from the bottom left and right towards the top of the frame. In the background, the lower level of the building is visible, featuring smooth walls and a few individuals near the base of the escalator. Potted plants line the sides of the scene, situated in the middle ground, adding greenery to the otherwise sleek and modern environment. The camera maintains a consistent height, positioned slightly above the escalator, providing a clear view of the descent. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial positioning throughout the video, maintaining a steady perspective on the architectural elements and the movement of the escalator.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an architectural scenery shot. The focus is on the design and structure of the space, highlighting elements like the escalator, railings, and surrounding environment. The emphasis is on the atmosphere and layout rather than a specific object or person, showcasing the scale and aesthetic of the architecture.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a first-person POV, depicts an indoor setting within a modern building, featuring a descending escalator. The environment is brightly illuminated by artificial lighting, making it unclear whether it is daytime or nighttime. The scene includes sleek architectural elements, such as metal railings and smooth walls, with potted plants adding a touch of greenery along the sides. The escalator leads to a lower level, where a few individuals are visible, indicating a public or commercial space. Overlays are present, including a watermark in the lower left corner that reads \"VIRTUAL. JAPAN. TV.\" The overall atmosphere is clean and contemporary, with a focus on the movement down the escalator.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on the caption. It is well-structured, detailed, and largely adheres to the instructions. Here is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **Excellent:** The caption accurately identifies the shot size (wide shot), the main subject (descending escalator), and its spatial framing (central, foreground to background). The description of the railings and the static camera is also correct.\n*   **Minor Inaccuracies:**\n    *   The caption states \"a few individuals near the base of the escalator.\" In the video, only one person appears after the start and walks across the background. Using \"a person\" would be more precise.\n    *   It mentions \"Potted plants line the sides of the scene.\" The plants are predominantly visible on the right side of the frame.\n    *   The camera is described as \"slightly above the escalator.\" A more accurate description would be \"from a high angle at the top of the escalator,\" as it provides a steep downward view.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   **Excellent:** The caption successfully describes the 2D and 3D positions of multiple key elements (escalator, railings, lower level, plants), fulfilling a core requirement of the instructions.\n*   **Area for Improvement:** The caption mentions the movement of the escalator steps but omits the movement of the person who walks from left to right at the bottom of the escalator in the background. Including this detail would make the description of the scene's dynamics more complete.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Excellent:** The caption follows the single-paragraph format, uses simple English, and correctly structures the information by starting with the shot size and then detailing the spatial arrangement.\n*   **Minor Deviation:** The phrase \"adding greenery to the otherwise sleek and modern environment\" leans slightly towards subjective interpretation. While not a major violation, a more objective description would be to simply state the presence and location of the plants without commenting on their aesthetic function, in stricter adherence to the instruction to avoid subjective language.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is very strong and demonstrates a good understanding of the task. The feedback provided is intended for fine-tuning to achieve perfect alignment with the instructions. By making the minor adjustments to accuracy and completeness, the caption would be an exemplary model of the required output.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video presents a high-angle wide shot from the top of a descending escalator. The camera captures the full length of the escalator, which occupies the central portion of the frame, extending from the foreground down into the background. The escalator's handrails and steps are clearly visible, with the steps moving downward. On either side of the escalator, metal railings run parallel, positioned in the middle ground. In the background, the lower level of the building is visible, featuring smooth walls, and a person walks from left to right near the base of the escalator. Potted plants are situated in the middle ground, predominantly on the right side of the frame. The camera maintains a consistent position, providing a clear, steady view of the descent and the architectural elements.",
