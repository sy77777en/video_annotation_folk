    "pre_caption": "This video is framed as a medium close-up, captured from over the person's left shoulder. The laptop occupies the center of the frame and sits in the middle ground. The person's right hand is positioned in the bottom right corner of the frame, resting in the foreground as it interacts with the laptop keyboard. A blurred section of the person's head and shoulder is visible in the top right corner, also in the foreground. The laptop screen, showing an audio editing application, is centrally located within the laptop's frame in the middle ground. Positioned to the right of the laptop, also in the middle ground, is a smartphone connected via a cable and adapter. The camera remains static throughout the shot, positioned above the subjects, providing a high-angle view.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Filmed from over the left shoulder, the video centers on a silver MacBook Pro laptop being used by a person on a desk. The person's light-skinned right hand, adorned with a small black hair tie, is visible resting on the keyboard in the lower right portion of the frame. A blurred view of the left rear side of the person's face occupies the upper right corner. The laptop screen is illuminated, displaying the macOS interface with an active audio editing application window featuring a sound waveform. Adjacent to the laptop on the right lies a dark-colored smartphone with a reflective screen, connected to the computer by a cable and a small black adapter.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows a silver MacBook Pro laptop placed on a desk in an indoor setting. The laptop screen displays the macOS desktop background, featuring a coastal landscape, with an audio editing application window open in the foreground showing sound waveforms. A dark-colored smartphone lies to the right of the laptop, but it is not connected to the computer. A cable and a small adapter are connected to the laptop. A person's hands are visible interacting with the laptop, typing on the keyboard and using the trackpad. The person wears a dark bracelet on their right wrist. The lighting appears to be ambient indoor light.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video is filmed from the left rear side of a person, showing a hand using a laptop. 80% of the laptop is clearly visible in the center of the frame. On the right side, a small portion of a blurred head and shoulder is visible, while a hand is clear in the lower-right corner of the frame, partially visible.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly states the shot is \"captured from over the person's left shoulder\"; it should be the \"right shoulder,\" as the blurred part of the person and their visible hand are both on the right side of the frame. The description of the hand \"resting... as it interacts\" is slightly contradictory; it should be clarified that the fingers are actively typing on the keyboard. Finally, the sentence \"The laptop is connected to an adapter and cable, but not to the smartphone\" should be revised to focus purely on spatial framing. A more appropriate description would be, \"An adapter and cable extend from the right side of the laptop in the middle ground,\" removing the detail about the smartphone connection, which is not a spatial attribute.",
