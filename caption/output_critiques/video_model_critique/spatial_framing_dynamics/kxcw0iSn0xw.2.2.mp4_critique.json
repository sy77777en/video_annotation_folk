    "pre_caption": "The video is a close-up shot focusing on a tomato positioned in the center foreground. A hose with a nozzle extends from the bottom center of the frame, aiming a thin, high-pressure water jet vertically through the tomato. In the middle ground, directly behind the tomato, the out-of-focus head and shoulders of a man are visible. The background consists of green trees. The water jet slices upward through the tomato, causing water and pulp to spray out from the top. As the cut progresses, the top half of the tomato begins to separate and lift away from the bottom half. The camera remains static and at the subject's level throughout the action.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a high-pressure water jet slicing through a tomato suspended in midair. The tomato is prominently featured in the foreground, with its red color and smooth surface clearly visible. In the middle ground, a man is partially visible, wearing a red cap and a gray shirt. His head and shoulders are slightly out of focus, indicating he is observing the action. The man appears to be middle-aged, with short hair and a neutral expression. The focus remains on the tomato and the water jet, highlighting the precision of the cut.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor setting during the day, featuring a clear blue sky and lush green trees in the background. The environment is bright and vibrant, emphasizing the natural surroundings. The serene background provides a tranquil atmosphere.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: \nThe video features a high-pressure water jet cutting a tomato hanging midair in the foreground, captured in a close-up. In the background, a man watches, his head and shoulders visible but out of focus.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly states that the hose extends from the \"bottom center-right\" of the frame when it is positioned in the \"bottom center.\" Additionally, the description of the tomato's movement is inaccurate; it claims both pieces exit from the \"top left,\" but the video shows the left half moving toward the top left and the right half moving toward the top right. The phrase \"with the pieces exiting the frame from the top left\" should be corrected to \"with the left piece exiting toward the top left and the right piece exiting toward the top right\" to accurately describe the spatial dynamics.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video is a close-up, slow-motion shot focusing on a tomato positioned in the center foreground. A hose with a nozzle extends from the bottom center of the frame, aiming a thin, high-pressure water jet vertically through the tomato. In the middle ground, directly behind the tomato, the out-of-focus head and shoulders of a man are visible. The background consists of green trees. The water jet slices upward through the tomato, splitting it in half and causing water and pulp to spray out from the top. The two halves are then pushed upward and outward by the force of the water, with the left half moving toward the top left and the right half moving toward the top right. The camera remains static and at the subject's level throughout the action.",
