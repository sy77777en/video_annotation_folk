    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot from behind two audience members in the right foreground, with the left side of the frame obscured. The camera trucks to the right, revealing a full view of a stage in the background, framed by a red curtain in the middle ground. A man, shown from the upper torso up, walks from the left side of the stage to the center background, stopping behind a small table. The framing settles with the man centered in the middle ground, illuminated by a circular spotlight, while the backs and clapping hands of the audience are visible in the foreground at the bottom of the frame. After a moment, the man picks up a statuette from the table and walks off-screen to the right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Several people are seen from behind, seated in red theater chairs and facing a stage. One man has short, graying hair and wears a dark suit jacket. A young man with fair skin, dark curly hair, and a mustache, dressed in a black turtleneck and a matching jacket, walks onto the stage. He stands behind a small table and picks up a golden-colored statuette with an abstract design that is already on the table after the audience starts to applaud. As the audience members, whose hands are briefly visible, applaud, the young man smiles slightly before walking away with his award.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From an audience perspective, the scene unfolds in a dark theater looking towards a small stage framed by heavy, red velvet curtains. A circular spotlight illuminates a man in a black turtleneck and jacket who walks to a small, cloth-covered table. On the table rests a golden, stylized statuette, which he picks up as audience members in the foreground clap from their red, upholstered seats. Camera flashes from the audience direction occur periodically, shifting the scene's color from warm tones to a cool blue.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video depicts an award event. Several people are seated facing the stage, with their upper backs visible as they move out of frame while the camera trucks to the right. The award winner enters the frame, showing his upper torso, and then exits the scene.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the initial obscured framing, the camera's rightward truck movement, and the subsequent reveal of the stage and the main subject. The description of the man's movement from left to center, his position behind the table, and his final exit to the right are all precise. The spatial relationships between the audience (foreground), the man (middle ground), and the curtain (background) are described correctly.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is very complete, covering the entire sequence of the video. It effectively details the change in framing from a partial view to a full view, the introduction and movement of the main subject, the settled composition with the audience and the man on stage, and the subject's final action and exit. It successfully captures all the essential spatial dynamics and subject interactions within the scene.\n\n**Adherence to the Instruction:** The caption adheres perfectly to the instructions.\n*   It is a single, concise paragraph written in simple, natural English.\n*   It strictly describes spatial framing and dynamics, using the specified terminology (shot size, 2D/3D position, movement).\n*   It correctly identifies the shot size (\"medium shot\"), positions (\"right foreground,\" \"center background,\" \"bottom of the frame\"), depth (\"foreground,\" \"middle ground\"), and movement (\"trucks to the right,\" \"walks from the left,\" \"walks off-screen\").\n*   It avoids subjective adjectives, speculation, and any information not visually present in the video.",

The camera trucks right to reveal a stage in the background, framed by a red curtain in the middle ground. A man walks from the left to the center of the stage, stopping behind a table under a spotlight. As the audience in the foreground claps, the man picks up a statuette from the table, holds it for a moment, and then walks off-screen to the right.",
