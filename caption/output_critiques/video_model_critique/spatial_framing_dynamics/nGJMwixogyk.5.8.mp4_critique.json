    "pre_caption": "The video is a wide shot capturing a traditional Japanese street scene. The camera is positioned at eye level, providing a first-person perspective as it moves through the narrow, stone-paved alley. Wooden buildings with tiled roofs line both sides of the street, positioned in the middle ground, with their facades adorned with lanterns and signs. Lush greenery, including bamboo, is visible in the foreground along the edges of the path, adding texture and vibrancy. A small scooter and a pink umbrella are positioned on the left side in the middle ground, while power lines stretch overhead in the background, connecting the buildings and adding an urban element. The camera smoothly transitions forward, maintaining a consistent height and focus on the harmonious blend of nature and traditional architecture.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot capturing a traditional Japanese street. The scene features narrow, stone-paved pathways flanked by wooden buildings with tiled roofs, showcasing a blend of rustic charm and cultural architecture. Lanterns and signs adorn the structures, adding to the authentic atmosphere. Lush greenery, including bamboo and trees, lines the street, enhancing the serene and picturesque environment. The focus is on the overall ambiance and architectural details, rather than any specific object, highlighting the harmonious blend of nature and traditional design.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, navigating a quaint, narrow alley in a traditional Japanese setting. The scene is outdoors during the day, as natural light illuminates the area. The alley is flanked by wooden buildings with distinctively sloped roofs and warm, earthy tones. Posters and signs adorn the walls, adding a touch of local culture. A small scooter is parked near one of the buildings, and a pink umbrella provides a splash of color. The path is paved with stone, bordered by lush greenery, including bamboo plants, which add texture and vibrancy. Overhead, power lines stretch across the sky, connecting the buildings and adding an urban element to the otherwise traditional scene. The overall atmosphere is serene and picturesque, capturing the essence of a quiet, culturally rich neighborhood.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption generally follows the instruction well, accurately describing the wide shot, camera height, and the spatial arrangement of key elements such as the wooden buildings, motorbike, pink umbrella, and power lines. However, it inaccurately states that the camera provides a first-person perspective and moves through the alley, when in fact the camera pans left and then tracks slowly forward along the street, not simulating a first-person view. The caption also mentions lush greenery and bamboo in the foreground and middle ground, but in the video, greenery is mostly present along the left and right edges in the middle ground, not prominently in the foreground. The description of the camera panning left is correct, but the transition is not a pan followed by a forward movement; rather, the camera pans left and then tracks forward. The phrase \"harmonious blend of nature and traditional architecture\" is subjective and should be removed. To improve, clarify that the camera starts with a wide shot at eye level, pans left to reframe the street, then tracks forward along the alley, with the motorbike in the bottom right and the pink umbrella in the bottom left in the initial frame, both in the middle ground, and that the buildings line both sides in the middle ground and background. Remove subjective language and ensure all spatial positions are described precisely as seen.",
