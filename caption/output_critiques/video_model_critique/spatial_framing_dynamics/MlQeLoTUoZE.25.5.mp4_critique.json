    "pre_caption": "The video employs a consistent wide shot, with the camera positioned above and trailing a central aircraft. Initially, this aircraft is in the middle ground, advancing through an enclosed tunnel whose walls and ceiling elements are visible on the left, right, and top of the frame, receding from foreground to background. The tunnel's exit, initially in the distant background center, expands as the aircraft approaches. Upon emerging, the aircraft maintains its center-middle ground position, now navigating an open expanse towards a prominent energy sphere and a smaller dark orb, both located in the background center. This destination is flanked by large, dark crystalline structures positioned on the left, right, and in the further background. Throughout the sequence, various HUD elements, including a boost meter (top left), control prompts (top center), a radar display (bottom left), and a weapon icon (top right), are fixed in the foreground, with a targeting reticle also appearing in the foreground, centered on the distant objects.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a gray, angular aircraft marked with \"UNSC\" on its top surface, flying forward. It has two large, bright blue glowing engines at the rear, flanking a central cockpit area with two smaller, purple glowing engines. Initially, the aircraft is viewed from a rear-facing, slightly elevated perspective as it moves through a metallic, enclosed tunnel with red and white striped markings on the side walls and \"UNSC INFINITY\" written on an overhead arch. The tunnel also includes overhead structures with yellow markings and numbers like \"3\". The aircraft then exits the tunnel into a vast, open area filled with towering, dark, jagged, crystalline-like structures. In the distance, a crystalline energy sphere emits an orange energy field, partially obscured by a crystalline disc-shaped portal. A smaller, dark spherical object is positioned in front of this portal. On-screen overlay elements include a \"BOOST\" meter in the top left, initially at 0% and later at 100%, and text prompts like \"USE [D] TO BOOST PELICAN\" and \"USE [D] TO TURN PELICAN.\" After accelerating, an overlay text \"USE RS TO TURN RELICAN\" appears in the upper-middle section of the frame. A small, green aircraft icon is visible in a circular radar display in the bottom left, and a \"CHECKPOINT ... DONE\" message appears. A targeting reticle is located in the center of the screen, along with an icon representing a weapon in the upper right.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person 3D game video where the entire character is visible on screen shows a grey, metallic UNSC Pelican spacecraft with prominent, glowing blue back engines. The video begins with the Pelican accelerating through a narrow, grey, metallic launch tube, which has \"UNSC\" and \"INFINITY\" inscribed on an archway and features red and white striped warning markings on its interior walls, heading towards a bright light at the end. As the spacecraft exits the launch tube, the view expands to reveal a more open, outdoor aerial environment. The scene then transitions to an expansive, alien outdoor environment where the Pelican flies towards a large, dark, spherical object partially obscured by a glowing, reddish-orange, circular energy field or portal. This portal is framed by massive, dark, angular, crystalline or metallic structures scattered throughout the frame, extending vertically across the entire scene from a cloudy or gaseous surface below, under a bright, hazy sky. A disc-shaped portal or similar object is positioned at the top of the frame. Throughout the video, overlay elements are present: a \"BOOST\" meter with a star icon in the top left corner (showing 0% then 100%); a control prompt \"USE [LT icon] TO BOOST PELICAN\" (later changing to \"USE [RS icon] TO TURN PELICAN\") at the top center; and in the latter part, a \"CHECKPOINT ... DONE\" message with a small green aircraft icon in a circular reticle in the bottom left, a weapon icon in the top right, and a blue, translucent, hexagonal targeting reticle in the center.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

The video is presented from a first-person perspective inside a cockpit, the frame of which is a constant foreground element that is not mentioned. The aircraft being followed is in the middle ground, not the foreground as stated twice in the caption. The description of the camera being \"positioned above\" the aircraft is also inaccurate; the camera is positioned behind the aircraft at a similar height, looking forward from the cockpit. The description should be revised to state that the view is from a first-person cockpit perspective, with the cockpit frame in the foreground, and to correctly place the followed aircraft in the center-middle ground throughout the video.",
