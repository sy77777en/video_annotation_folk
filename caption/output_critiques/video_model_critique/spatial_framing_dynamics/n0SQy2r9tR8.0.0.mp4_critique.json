    "pre_caption": "A medium close-up shot centers on a man in the foreground, with the background appearing dark and out of focus. The lighting on the man gradually dims, eventually leaving him almost entirely in shadow. Throughout this transition, he remains stationary in the center of the frame, and the camera is positioned at his level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A dark-skinned man with short, dark hair, a goatee, and a mustache looks directly at the camera with a serious expression. He has a distinct vertical slit shaved into his left eyebrow. He is wearing a light blue, patterned zip-up hoodie over a white t-shirt. Two silver-colored chain necklaces with pendants are visible around his neck. He is seated throughout the video.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit room with a cool, bluish ambiance, a person sits on a light-colored couch. The lighting is focused, illuminating the foreground while the background remains in deep shadow, with only faint, out-of-focus shapes visible. Throughout the scene, the light level dims to near darkness. The individual wears a light blue, patterned zip-up hoodie over a white shirt and several silver-colored necklaces.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is largely accurate in its description of the shot size, subject position, depth, and the primary dynamic of the light dimming. However, the sentence structure could be improved for better logical flow. The final clause, \"and the camera is positioned at his level,\" describes a static element of the shot's composition but is appended to a sentence describing the subject's movement. To enhance clarity, this detail about the camera's height should be integrated with the initial description of the shot's framing. The subsequent sentence could then focus exclusively on the dynamic changes occurring within that established frame.",
