    "pre_caption": "The video uses a wide shot to capture the rural landscape, with the paved road occupying the center and lower part of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground and curving gently to the right. On the right side of the frame and in the middle ground, a low stone wall, a white metal gate, and a cross-shaped metal structure are visible, with a yellow triangular road sign mounted near the wall. The left side of the frame features green grass and low vegetation in the foreground and middle ground, with a pond and trees further back. In the background, several houses with red roofs are visible, mostly positioned toward the center and right of the frame, surrounded by trees and shrubs. The sky, filled with large white clouds, dominates the upper half of the frame and forms the background. In the second image, a black car appears in the middle ground, crossing the intersection from left to right, with its position shifting from the left-center to the center of the frame. The camera is positioned at approximately road level, matching the height of the road and the car, and remains stationary throughout the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a rural landscape scenery shot, capturing a quiet, sunlit country road that gently curves through a verdant area under a vast, partly cloudy sky. The scene features lush greenery along the roadside, a few scattered houses, and a tranquil atmosphere enhanced by the expansive blue sky filled with billowing white clouds. The focus is on the environment and the sense of open space, emphasizing the peacefulness and scale of the rural setting rather than highlighting any specific object or individual, which is why there is no main subject in the video.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place outdoors on a rural road under a bright blue sky scattered with large, white clouds. The road is paved and curves gently, bordered by patches of green grass and low vegetation on both sides. On the right, a low stone wall and a white metal gate mark the entrance to a property with a small building, while a cross-shaped metal structure rises above the wall. Further along, a yellow triangular road sign with a red border and a black cross mark in the middle is mounted on a post near the wall. In the distance, a few houses with red roofs are visible, surrounded by trees and shrubs. The scene includes a black car moving across an intersection where the road splits, with the car’s dark, glossy surface reflecting sunlight. The overall environment is quiet and open, with no overlays or text present in the video.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

The rest of the caption accurately describes the spatial framing, shot size (wide shot), and the 2D and 3D positions of the road, stone wall, gate, cross-shaped structure, road sign, buildings, vegetation, pond, trees, houses, and sky. The camera’s height and stationary position are correctly noted. To improve the caption, delete all references to the black car and its movement, as these details are not present in the video.
