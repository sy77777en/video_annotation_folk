    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective, the scene is framed with the character's arm in the bottom left foreground, looking into a small, curved pod. A circular hatch occupies the center foreground, with a ladder positioned to its right, extending vertically through the frame. In the background, a curved console wraps around the space, featuring a large screen on the top left. A red fire extinguisher is dropped from the left, landing in the center-right foreground near the ladder's base. The scene's lighting then shifts from white to flashing red, and the camera's view begins to shake violently. Smoke fills the pod, obscuring the background, while sparks erupt from a panel in the center-right background. A red rectangular panel detaches from the wall in the center-right background and falls into the right foreground, landing near a seat. The camera remains at the character's eye level throughout, but its position becomes unstable, simulating the impact.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person perspective, a character wearing an orange and black suit is inside a small, circular, futuristic pod. The pod's interior is initially white after the lights turn on, with a black ladder located in the center of the pod and a circular hatch on the floor. A large screen displays a \"LAUNCH SEQUENCE ACTIVE\" warning in red text. A red fire extinguisher falls onto the floor. The environment abruptly changes as the main lights go out, replaced by flashing red emergency lights. Smoke fills the pod, sparks fly from a wall panel, and a red rectangular panel detaches from the wall, falling to the floor as the situation deteriorates.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures the chaotic interior of a small, futuristic spacecraft pod during a crash. The scene begins inside a curved, white-paneled cabin containing a black ladder, a circular floor hatch, and a console. Text on a wall screen displays \"LAUNCH SEQUENCE ACTIVE\" and warns of entering a planetary atmosphere, instructing to \"Brace for impact.\" The environment rapidly deteriorates as the lights flicker and turn to a flashing red emergency state. Smoke fills the small space, sparks erupt from a wall panel, and the entire pod shakes violently. A red panel detaches from the wall and clatters to the floor near a pilot's seat. A red fire extinguisher falls onto the floor from the left at first.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is mostly accurate but contains a few minor inaccuracies and could be improved for clarity. The statement that the fire extinguisher slides \"to the background near the opposite wall\" is incorrect; it lands in the middle ground and stops near the ladder's base. The description of the falling panel landing \"in the place between middleground and background\" is awkward and can be simplified to \"in the middle ground.\" Additionally, the caption omits that the character first takes the fire extinguisher from a mount on the left wall before dropping it. Finally, describing the ladder as \"in the center of the pod\" is slightly misleading; it is positioned on the right side of the frame, to the right of the central hatch.",
