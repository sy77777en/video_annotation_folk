    "pre_caption": "A full shot centers on a man standing in the middle ground of the frame. He is positioned between two large concrete pillars, with the left pillar on the left and the right pillar on the right, and a metal gate is located directly behind him, all in the middle ground. A paved area occupies the foreground, while green hedges and a modern building are visible in the background. The camera remains stationary at the subject's level, maintaining a consistent central framing of the man throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A Black man with a shaved head stands in front of a gate. He is wearing a long-sleeved sweater with a black and white checkerboard pattern, blue jeans, and dark shoes. A silver-colored chain is visible around his neck, and a set of keys hangs from his belt loop. Initially, he lets his hands hang naturally at his sides. As he sings, he performs a series of movements: crossing his hands in front of his body, swinging them, lowering them, and then holding his right arm across his chest while extending his left arm straight forward.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an outdoor urban setting during the day, a man in a black-and-white checkered sweater and blue jeans stands on a paved area in front of a green metal gate. The gate is set between two large, light-colored concrete pillars. Signs are mounted on both pillars, with the one on the right featuring a CCTV camera icon and text, and a sign on the gate indicating that pets are prohibited. Beyond the gate, manicured green hedges line a path leading toward a modern, multi-story residential building in the background. The scene is illuminated by sunlight, which casts shadows on the ground and creates a slight blur effect in the background.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The description of the camera movement as moving \"in a clockwise direction\" is inaccurate. The camera movement creates a vertigo or dolly zoom effect, where the background blurs and appears to rush forward and shift around the subject. To correct this, the final sentence should be changed from \"The camera moves in a clockwise direction around the man, maintaining a consistent central framing throughout the shot\" to \"The camera moves, creating a vertigo effect where the background blurs and shifts rapidly while the man remains centrally framed.\"",
