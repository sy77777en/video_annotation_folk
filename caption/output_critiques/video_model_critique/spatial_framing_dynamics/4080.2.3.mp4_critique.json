    "pre_caption": "In a close-up shot, a person's leg in blue pants dominates the left foreground. In the middle ground, the lower legs and feet of several other people are visible running from the center to the right side of the frame on leafy ground. The camera is positioned at the subjects' leg level and moves along with them, creating significant motion blur throughout the scene, which indicates rapid movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In the foreground, a person's legs are visible, wearing blue pants and brown furry boots. In the middle ground, the lower legs and feet of several people are running on ground covered in dirt and leaves. One person wears light-colored pants, while another individual is seen wearing dark pants and dark boots.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A dynamic, motion-filled scene is set outdoors in a wooded area during the day. The ground is covered in a mixture of dirt, grass, and leaves in shades of brown and green, with small red leaves scattered about. A large form, which is a person's legs in blue pants, occupies most of the foreground. In the middle ground, several people are visible running on the uneven, leafy ground. The scene exhibits some motion blur, indicating rapid movement.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption inaccurately states that the position of the people in the middle ground \"remains stationary within the frame.\" While the camera tracks them, causing them to stay in a relatively consistent area, they are not perfectly stationary. This should be rephrased to describe the camera's tracking motion that keeps them in the same general part of the frame. Additionally, the caption omits the specific 2D movement of the main subject; the person's blue leg moves from a more central position to the left side of the frame, which is a key spatial dynamic that should be included. Finally, the phrase \"is running\" is an interpretation of the action, and the description should focus more strictly on the observable spatial movement.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a close-up, low-angle shot, a person's leg in blue pants moves from the center to the left foreground. In the middle ground, the lower legs and feet of several other people move rapidly across leafy ground. The camera, positioned at leg level, tracks alongside the subjects, keeping the group in the center-right portion of the frame. The entire scene is characterized by significant motion blur, indicating the speed of the movement.",
