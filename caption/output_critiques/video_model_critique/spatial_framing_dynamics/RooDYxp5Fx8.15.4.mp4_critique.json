    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a view of a city sidewalk bordered by a dark brown metal railing with vertical bars and a yellow tactile paving strip set into gray tiles. The camera moves forward along the sidewalk, revealing a street intersection with several vehicles, including white and red cars, moving in an orderly manner at a crosswalk marked by orange traffic cones. The background features lush green trees partially obscuring a building with a sloped roof, and a clear blue sky with scattered white clouds suggests daytime and fair weather. Street signs, utility poles, and a large metal-backed sign with visible bolts and a reflective surface are positioned near the sidewalk, and the overall environment is clean and orderly.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing a vibrant urban intersection bordered by lush green trees and a bright blue sky with scattered white clouds. The scene features a wide, clean sidewalk with a tactile paving strip, dark brown metal railings, and various street signs and traffic cones, while several vehicles, including white and red cars, are visible on the road. The focus is on the overall environment, highlighting the harmonious blend of urban infrastructure and natural elements, rather than emphasizing any single object or individual. There is no main subject because the intent is to convey the atmosphere and scale of the cityscape, immersing the viewer in the setting itself.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moving along a city sidewalk bordered by a dark brown metal railing with vertical bars and a yellow tactile paving strip set into gray tiles. The setting is outdoors at a street intersection, with several vehicles, including white and red cars, moving in an orderly manner at a crosswalk marked by orange traffic cones. Lush green trees line the background, partially obscuring a building with a sloped roof, while a clear blue sky with scattered white clouds suggests daytime and fair weather. Street signs, utility poles, and a large metal-backed sign with visible bolts and a reflective surface are positioned near the sidewalk, and the overall environment is clean and orderly.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption does not fully meet the instruction requirements. It omits the shot size, which is a wide shot showing the sidewalk and street, and does not specify the 2D and 3D positions of the main elements. The caption should clarify that the sidewalk and railing are in the bottom left and foreground, the street and vehicles are in the center and middle ground, and the trees and building are in the background. The camera is positioned at approximately the height of the railing and sidewalk, moving forward along the path, causing the railing and sidewalk to shift from the bottom left foreground toward the left edge as the camera advances, while the street and vehicles remain in the middle ground and center. The caption should also note that the camera movement is a smooth forward tracking shot, and that the spatial relationship between elements changes as the camera approaches the intersection, with the metal-backed sign and utility poles moving from the middle left to the center foreground. Remove weather and cleanliness details, as they are not relevant to spatial framing. Focus the revision on shot size, spatial positions, depth, camera height, and movement dynamics.",
