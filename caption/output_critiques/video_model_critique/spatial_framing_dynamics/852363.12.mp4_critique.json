    "pre_caption": "This close-up shot primarily features several pairs of legs and feet dangling in the middle ground, positioned across the upper half of the frame (top left, top center, top right). Below them, a textured metallic platform occupies the bottom portion of the frame, stretching from the foreground into the middle ground. A large, blurry vertical element is prominent in the right foreground, partially obscuring the view. The legs show slight movement, suggesting the motion of a ride. The camera is positioned at a low angle, looking up from the platform towards the feet.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a group of people seated on a swing ride. The focus is on their legs and feet, which are visible as they dangle above a metallic platform. The individuals are wearing a variety of footwear, including sandals and closed shoes, and some are dressed in patterned pants. The scene captures the motion of the ride, with legs slightly elevated and swinging. The overall composition highlights the diversity in clothing and footwear among the riders.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a low-angle view from a textured, metallic floor, characteristic of an amusement park ride platform. Several pairs of legs dangle just above this surface, belonging to unseen riders seated above. The footwear varies, including dark sneakers, dark wedge boots worn with patterned leggings, and sandals. The background is indistinct, hinting at a bustling fairground environment. The legs hang suspended, suggesting the motion of a ride.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly describes the camera angle as \"level\"; it should be corrected to \"low angle\" or \"angled up\" since the camera is positioned on the ground looking upwards. The phrase \"As the camera shifts to the right\" is speculative; it should be revised to describe the observable relative motion, such as \"a large, blurry vertical element moves from left to right across the foreground\". Additionally, the description of movement could be more precise; instead of stating the element \"appears\", describe its motion across the frame. Similarly, the \"slight movement\" of the legs should be described more dynamically, noting their horizontal travel across the frame as part of the ride's motion.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a low-angle, close-up perspective, the feet and lower legs of people on a carnival ride swing horizontally across the frame from left to right. They dangle above a gray, textured metal platform that fills the bottom of the shot. A blurry, thick pole stands in the right foreground, partially obscuring the view as the riders' feet, clad in various shoes like wedge boots and sneakers, glide past.",
