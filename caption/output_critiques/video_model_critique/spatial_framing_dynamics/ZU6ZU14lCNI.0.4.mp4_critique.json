    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide, static scenery shot captured from a low-angle perspective. The Chicago Cultural Center is the main architectural element, positioned in the middle ground and filling the frame from the bottom right towards the top center. In the background, a taller skyscraper is visible to the left of the center. The foreground contains the top of a street lamp and the bare branches of a tree, both located in the bottom-left corner.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a low-angle cityscape scenery shot, capturing the grand facade of a classical-style stone building. The structure, identified by a banner as the Chicago Cultural Center, features a series of large, arched windows and ornate stonework, with a taller, more modern skyscraper visible in the distance behind it. The scene is bathed in a blue sky, which appears somber due to a filter applied, creating an imposing atmosphere. There is no main subject, as the focus is on establishing a sense of place and conveying the monumental scale of the urban architecture rather than highlighting a specific person or object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A low-angle, outdoor view captures the facade of the Chicago Cultural Center under a pale greenish-yellow sky. The large, classical building is constructed from light-colored stone and features a series of prominent arched windows. A blue-green banner with white text and a geometric design is fixed next to one of the upper-story windows. In the background, a taller, light-colored skyscraper rises into the sky. The bare branches of a tree and a street lamp are visible in the lower-left corner of the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

The final sentence, \"The background features a sky with hues of yellow and green,\" repeats information already provided in the third sentence and should be deleted. Additionally, the description of the Chicago Cultural Center's position could be more precise by stating that it occupies the right side of the frame from bottom to top, in addition to its depth. The description of the street lamp and tree as \"middle ground\" is acceptable, but \"foreground\" would be more accurate.",
