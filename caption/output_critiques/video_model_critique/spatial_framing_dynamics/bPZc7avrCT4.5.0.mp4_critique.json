    "pre_caption": "This close-up shot centers on a yellow balloon resting on a wooden stool in the middle ground. A person's hand holding a knife is positioned in the top-center middle ground, directly above the balloon, with the person's torso visible in the center background. The hand and knife move downward, striking the balloon in the center of the frame. The balloon bursts, causing water to splash outwards from the center, covering the stool and moving toward the foreground. Torn pieces of the yellow balloon are also propelled away from the center. The knife continues its downward motion, coming to rest in the center of the now water-covered stool. The camera remains stationary and at the subject's level throughout the action.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a yellow balloon placed on a wooden stool. A person, wearing a light pink shirt and gray shorts, is partially visible, holding a knife. The person uses the knife to pop the balloon, resulting in water splashing onto the stool. The focus is on the action of the balloon being popped and the subsequent splash of water.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an outdoor setting on a wet, waterlogged concrete surface, a single yellow water balloon sits atop a round wooden stool. A hand holding a knife resembling a scimitar is positioned above the balloon. The knife is brought down, piercing the balloon, which then bursts in a dramatic slow-motion sequence. Water explodes outwards in a wide splash, covering the wooden stool, while torn pieces of the yellow balloon are propelled away with the spray. The background is a soft-focus view of the wet concrete and distant greenery.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly describes the balloon as being in the \"middle ground\" while the stool it sits on is in the \"foreground.\" Since the balloon is resting on the stool, they occupy the same depth plane. This should be corrected to state that both the balloon and the stool are in the foreground. For instance, change \"a yellow balloon in the middle ground resting on a wooden stool in the foreground\" to \"a yellow balloon resting on a wooden stool in the foreground.\" Additionally, the phrase \"in the center of the further middle ground\" is slightly awkward and could be simplified to \"in the middle ground\" for better clarity.",
