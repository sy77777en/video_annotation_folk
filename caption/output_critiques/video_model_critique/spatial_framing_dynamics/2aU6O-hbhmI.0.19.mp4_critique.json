    "pre_caption": "The video features a wide shot of a cityscape during sunset. The primary subject is a tall, modern high-rise building occupying the left side of the frame, extending from the bottom left towards the top left. This building is in the foreground, with its numerous balconies and glass windows prominently displayed. The camera captures the building from a slightly upward angle, suggesting the camera is positioned below the building's height. As the video progresses, the camera pans upwards, gradually revealing more of the building's upper floors while the sky occupies the top portion of the frame. The background includes a parking structure and other city elements, situated in the lower right quadrant of the frame, indicating the middle ground. The sky, with its gradient colors, fills the top right section, serving as the backdrop. Throughout the video, the spatial relationship remains consistent, emphasizing the building's verticality and the expansive sky. The camera movement enhances the sense of scale and perspective, transitioning smoothly from the lower levels of the building to its higher sections.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot. It captures the towering presence of a modern high-rise building with numerous balconies and large glass windows, set against a vibrant sunset sky. The focus is on the urban environment and the dramatic interplay of architectural lines with the colorful sky, rather than on any specific object or subject. The emphasis is on the scale and atmosphere of the cityscape, highlighting the contrast between the structured building and the natural beauty of the sunset.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a drone POV, presents an aerial view of an urban environment at sunset. The setting is outdoors, featuring a tall, modern building with a red brick facade and numerous balconies. The building's glass windows reflect the warm hues of the sunset, creating a striking contrast with the sky's gradient of orange and blue. Below, a parking structure and other cityscape elements are visible, indicating a bustling urban area. The scene transitions smoothly, maintaining focus on the architectural details and the expansive view of the city skyline, enhanced by the soft, ambient light of the setting sun.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "**Feedback on the Caption:**\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is inaccurate in several key areas. It describes the camera movement as a \"pan upwards,\" but the video clearly shows the camera physically ascending or flying up the side of the building, which is a translational movement, not a rotational pan. Consequently, the statement that \"the spatial relationship remains consistent\" is incorrect; the relationship between the camera and the building's floors is constantly changing as the camera moves. The caption also completely omits the people visible on a balcony, a salient detail the camera passes.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is incomplete. It fails to mention the human subjects on the balcony, which is a requirement of the instructions when salient subjects are present. It also doesn't capture the dynamic nature of the shot, which is a fly-by, not a static shot with a simple pan. The description of the camera's height as being \"below the building's height\" is an oversimplification that doesn't account for its continuous upward movement.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption fails to adhere to the instruction to \"describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the initial and final states\" and to describe the \"spatial movement of subjects.\" It mischaracterizes the primary movement in the scene and misses the secondary subjects (the people). While it avoids subjective language, its core description of the action is flawed.\n\nIn summary, the caption correctly identifies the static elements and their general placement but fails to accurately describe the crucial camera movement and omits the presence of human subjects, leading to an incorrect and incomplete analysis of the video's spatial dynamics.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a low-angle, wide shot of a tall, red-brick high-rise building at sunset. The building occupies the left side of the frame, while the cityscape and a colorful sky are visible in the background on the right. The primary action is the camera's continuous upward translational movement, as it flies up the face of the building. This movement creates a dynamic shift in perspective, with the camera's position relative to the building's floors constantly changing. As the camera ascends from its initial position near the lower-middle section of the building, it passes numerous balconies. At the 00:02 mark, it moves past a balcony where two people are standing, who are briefly the secondary subjects. The camera continues its ascent, and by the end of the clip, it has reached the upper floors, causing the cityscape below to move toward the bottom of the frame as more of the sky is revealed.",
