    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot of the sports car, capturing most of its body while it is in motion on a snowy surface. Initially, the car is positioned slightly off-center towards the left side of the frame, with its front facing the camera. The car occupies the foreground, with the snowy track and evergreen trees forming the background. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to a full shot, showing more of the car's surroundings. The camera moves from an initial position above the car to aligning at the car's level, providing a clearer view of its side profile. The car continues to move from left to right across the frame, maintaining its central position. The snowy track remains in the middle ground, while the trees stay in the background, creating depth in the scene. The camera captures the dynamic movement of the car as it kicks up snow, emphasizing its speed and the texture of the snowy surface.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a sports car with a striking red, blue, and white color scheme. The front of the car displays large numbers, \"+30°\" and \"-30°,\" prominently on the hood. The car's sleek design includes aerodynamic curves and a visible logo on the front. In the latter part of the video, the car is seen from the rear, showcasing its dynamic shape. The car is in motion, with snow being kicked up around it, indicating it is driving on a snowy surface.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a drone POV, showcases a dynamic outdoor scene on a snowy track. It features a sports car with a striking red, blue, and white color scheme, prominently displaying numbers and markings on its sleek, aerodynamic body. The setting is a wintry landscape with snow-covered ground and a backdrop of tall, dark evergreen trees. The time of day appears to be midday, with the sun casting a bright glow, creating a contrast between the car's vibrant colors and the white snow. The car is in motion, kicking up snow as it speeds along the track, emphasizing the sense of movement and energy in the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The provided caption is not good for this video. It fails to accurately describe the visual information and does not adhere to the core instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly inaccurate. It describes the video as a single, continuous shot with smooth camera movement, which is incorrect. The video is a fast-paced montage of four distinct shots joined by hard cuts.\n- The video does not start with a \"medium shot.\" It begins with a high-angle, Dutch-angled extreme close-up of the car's hood.\n- The caption claims the camera \"moves from an initial position above the car to aligning at the car's level.\" This is a false interpretation of the hard cuts between separate shots (a high-angle shot, a front-facing shot, an extreme close-up, and a low-angle side shot). There is no single, continuous camera movement.\n- The car does not \"continue to move from left to right.\" In the second shot, it moves directly toward the camera. Only in the final shot does it move across the frame.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is incomplete because it omits the most critical structural element of the video: the rapid cuts. It fails to describe each distinct shot segment, missing key details like the extreme close-up on the windshield (00:02) and the low-angle perspective of the final shot (00:03). By blending everything into one narrative, it loses all the specific spatial details of each individual shot.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption fails to follow the instructions in several key areas:\n- **Describing Transitions:** The instructions explicitly require describing shot transitions (e.g., hard cut) and analyzing the framing of each segment separately. The caption does the opposite, ignoring the cuts and inventing a continuous camera move.\n- **Spatial Framing:** It provides incorrect information about shot size, camera height, and the subject's movement throughout the video. For example, it misses the low-angle and high-angle perspectives that are clearly present.\n- **Avoiding Speculation:** While it avoids speculative language, its entire premise of a single continuous shot is a fabrication that misrepresents the visual facts.\n- **Conciseness and Clarity:** The description is not clear because it describes events that do not happen, leading to a confusing and false representation of the video's content.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video is a fast-paced montage of a Porsche Taycan driving on a snowy track, composed of four distinct shots joined by hard cuts.\n\nThe video opens with a high-angle, Dutch-angled extreme close-up of the car's hood, which is painted red, white, and blue. The numbers \"-30°\" and \"+30°\" are visible. The car is in rapid motion, creating significant motion blur against the white snow.\n\nA hard cut transitions to an eye-level, front-facing medium shot of the car driving directly toward the camera, kicking up snow. The \"PORSCHE\" brand name is visible on the windshield, and evergreen trees line the background.\n\nThe third shot, after another hard cut, is a very brief, low-angle extreme close-up of the windshield and roof, emphasizing the \"PORSCHE\" logo as the car speeds by.\n\nThe final shot is a low-angle medium shot from the side of the car. It captures the vehicle drifting from left to right, with its wheels spinning rapidly and throwing a large cloud of snow into the air. The blue side of the car, featuring the \"-30°\" graphic, is prominently displayed.",
