    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a low-angle shot, showing the lower body of a woman from the waist down, positioned in the bottom center of the frame and occupying the middle ground. As she performs rotations, she moves upwards, transitioning the view into a full shot where her entire body is visible near the center, slightly towards the right side of the frame. The white Olympic rings logo serves as the background element, consistently positioned in the top center. The woman then descends towards the bottom right, and the framing returns to showing only a partial view of her body before she exits the frame. The camera maintains a fixed position below the subject throughout the action.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures a woman in a blue one-piece swimsuit with crisscross back straps, her hair braided, as she jumps into the water. Mid-air, she performs a flipping motion against a dark blue background displaying the white Olympic rings logo. At the beginning and end of the video, the camera misaligns, showing only a small part of her body in the middle bottom and right bottom of the frame, respectively. She executes a dive, performing flips in the air.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set underwater in a diving pool, capturing a female athlete mid-air as she performs a one-and-a-half backward somersault. The camera is positioned at approximately the same height as the athlete, centered on her as she is positioned on the right side of the frame. A large, white Olympic rings logo is prominently displayed against a dark blue background wall.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a full shot of a woman jumping into the air and performing two midair rotations, as if preparing to dive into the water. The background includes an Olympic sign, indicating the scene takes place indoors. The camera remains at a fixed angle, with the woman's full body visible only during the middle portion of the video.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The video does not have enough information to determine the camera height relative to the subject. The camera may be at about the same height as the subject, but it's difficult to confirm.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains several factual inaccuracies regarding the subject's movement, the position of background elements, and the camera's perspective. The statement that the woman \"moves upwards\" and then \"descends towards the bottom right\" is incorrect; she remains in the center of the frame, rotating in place. The description of the Olympic rings logo is also wrong; it is positioned in the top center of the frame, not the left center, and it remains static rather than shifting due to camera movement. The camera itself appears to be stationary. Furthermore, the athlete does not exit the frame, and the shot does not return to a partial view; the video ends while she is still in a full shot. Finally, the claim that the camera \"maintains a consistent height with the female athlete\" is incorrect; the camera is positioned below the athlete, creating a consistent low-angle shot. The caption should be revised to state that the static, low-angle shot begins as a medium shot of the diver in the bottom center, transitions to a full shot as she tucks, and keeps her centered as she rotates, with the static Olympic rings logo visible in the top center background.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This static, low-angle underwater shot begins with a medium view of a female diver's lower body in the bottom center of the frame, her legs extended upwards. As she tucks her knees to her chest, the view becomes a full shot, capturing her entire body as she rotates in place in the center of the frame. Throughout the clip, the white Olympic rings logo remains stationary in the top center of the dark blue background. The video concludes while the diver is still in a full shot, mid-rotation.",
