    "pre_caption": "The video features a medium full shot of a silhouetted man positioned on the right side of the frame, facing a white pickup truck with rooftop tents. The man is in the foreground, while the truck is in the middle ground, slightly to the left. A camping table with various items is in front of the truck, positioned in the middle ground, slightly left of center. The scene is set in a rugged, outdoor desert environment during twilight, with distant mountains in the background. The camera is at the subject's level, maintaining a consistent height throughout the shot. The spatial arrangement remains stable, with no significant movement or changes in the framing of the subjects and elements.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a silhouetted man standing to the right, facing a white pickup truck equipped with rooftop tents. The man is wearing a hat and appears to be observing the scene. In front of the truck, there is a camping table with various items on it, including some containers. The truck is parked on uneven terrain, and the setup suggests a camping scenario. The overall lighting is low, emphasizing the silhouettes and creating a distinct contrast between the subjects and the dimly lit environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a third-person over-the-hip POV shot showing a character from waist height in an outdoor desert setting during twilight. The environment features a rugged landscape with distant mountains silhouetted against a dim sky. A white pickup truck with rooftop tents is parked on uneven terrain, accompanied by a folding table with camping gear. The truck's metallic surface contrasts with the dark surroundings, while the table holds items like a lantern and cooking equipment. The scene is characterized by the soft, muted colors of dusk, with shadows cast by the low light. The overall atmosphere is calm and still, with no visible movement or weather effects.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption:\n\n**Feedback:**\n\nThe caption is very well-written, accurate for the most part, and adheres closely to the instructions. It successfully describes the spatial composition of the scene in a clear and concise paragraph.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **Shot Size:** The description \"medium full shot of a silhouetted man\" is slightly inaccurate. A medium full shot typically frames a subject from the knees up. While the man is framed this way, he is a silhouetted element on the edge of the frame, not the central subject. The shot is more accurately described as a **medium shot of the campsite**, with the man acting as a framing element in the foreground.\n*   **Positions & Elements:** The 2D and 3D positioning of the man (foreground, right), the truck (middle ground, left), the table (middle ground, left of center), and the mountains (background) is perfectly accurate.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully covers all the required aspects: shot size, 2D/3D position of multiple elements, camera height, and the static nature of the shot.\n*   It correctly identifies the key subjects and elements within the frame.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   The caption follows the structural and stylistic guidelines well. It is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English.\n*   It correctly avoids speculation and emotional language. The use of \"rugged\" is a minor descriptive adjective but is acceptable in this context.\n*   It accurately notes the stability of the spatial arrangement and the absence of movement, fulfilling the \"dynamics\" part of the instruction.\n\n**Recommendation for Improvement:**\n\nTo improve accuracy, the description of the shot size should be revised to reflect the overall scene rather than focusing solely on the man.\n\n**Revised Example:**\n\n\"The video presents a **medium shot of a campsite at twilight**, framed by a silhouetted man in the **foreground on the right**. In the **middle ground**, a white pickup truck with rooftop tents is positioned to the **left**, with a camping table in **front of it, slightly left of center**. Distant mountains are visible across the **background**. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, and the entire spatial arrangement remains static with no movement or changes in framing.\"",
