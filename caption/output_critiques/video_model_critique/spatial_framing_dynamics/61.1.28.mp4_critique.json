    "pre_caption": "This is a close-up shot focusing on a man positioned in the center foreground. He faces the camera directly. In the background, a circular yellow neon light is visible in the top left, while a red neon sign and hanging lights occupy the top right. Streamers hang from the top center. Other indistinct figures are present in the bottom left and bottom right background. The subject remains relatively still within the frame throughout the clip. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man with dark skin and long dreadlocks, wearing a large, light-colored hat and oversized white sunglasses. He has a gray beard and is dressed in a green jacket over a patterned shirt. A silver chain necklace is visible around his neck. The man appears to be in a lively setting, with colorful lights and decorations around him. His expression is neutral, and he is facing the camera directly.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an indoor setting with a lively, festive atmosphere. The environment is dimly lit with warm, colorful lighting, featuring red and orange hues that create a vibrant ambiance. The space is decorated with hanging streamers and neon signs, contributing to a celebratory feel. The walls are adorned with various decorations, including a shimmering curtain that adds texture and reflects light. The scene includes a person wearing distinctive white, oversized sunglasses and a hat, adding to the lively and eclectic vibe. The setting suggests a casual, social gathering, with people in the background contributing to the dynamic energy of the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly describes the circular neon light in the top left as \"red-orange\"; it is yellow-orange. Additionally, the description of movement is incomplete. It states that the subject \"moves within the frame, shifting from the center-left to the center-right,\" which implies a static camera. However, the camera is also moving, likely handheld, creating an unsteady frame and following the subject's swaying motion. This camera movement is a key aspect of the shot's spatial dynamics and should be included for a more accurate description.",
