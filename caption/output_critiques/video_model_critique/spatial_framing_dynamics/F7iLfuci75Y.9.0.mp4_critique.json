In the right middle ground, one figure is seen from the back, with another figure to its left in the center middle ground.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features four humanoid figures seated at desks, each facing a computer screen. These figures have a metallic appearance, suggesting they might be robots or mannequins. They are positioned in a dimly lit room, with two figures visible in the middleground and two in the background. Each figure is oriented towards their respective screen, with their heads slightly tilted as if focused on the monitors. The figures are uniformly dressed in dark clothing, and their metallic heads reflect the light from the screens, creating a consistent visual theme throughout the video.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor setting, four figures with a reflective, metallic quality are present. Two of them are seated in a row at black desks, while the other two are positioned opposite each other, to the left and behind the first two. Dressed in black, they sit in matching office chairs, each facing a computer. The monitors are the primary light source, casting a blue glow onto the figures and their surroundings. Each screen displays a light blue background with a white, window-like logo. The overall environment is dark and monochromatic, defined by the arrangement of workstations.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Feedback on the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description of the shot size as a \"full shot\" is inaccurate. A full shot typically shows a subject from head to toe. This is more of a medium shot of the figures, capturing them from the waist or chest up within a wider composition of the room.\n*   The caption states there is a \"fourth figure\" in the left foreground. This is inaccurate and speculative. Only a computer monitor, keyboard, and the back of a chair are clearly visible in the left foreground; a figure is not. This violates the instruction to \"Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain.\"\n*   The spatial positioning of the three clearly visible figures (right middle ground, center middle ground, left background) is described accurately.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully describes the spatial arrangement using 2D (left, right, center) and 3D (foreground, middle ground, background) positioning.\n*   It correctly identifies the camera height relative to the subjects.\n*   It correctly notes the static nature of the shot by not mentioning any movement.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   The caption adheres to the single-paragraph format and uses simple, natural English.\n*   It correctly attempts to describe shot size, position, depth, and height.\n*   However, it fails to adhere to the instruction to avoid speculative statements by inventing a \"fourth figure\" that is not visible in the frame.\n\nIn summary, the caption provides a good foundation for describing the spatial layout but needs correction regarding the shot size and the inaccurate, speculative inclusion of a fourth figure in the foreground.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a medium shot, three humanoid figures are positioned at desks in a dimly lit room. One figure is seen from the back in the right middle ground, another is to its left in the center middle ground, and a third is in the left background. In the left foreground, the back of an empty chair and a computer setup are partially in view. Each figure sits in front of a computer monitor, which provides the main source of light in the dark space. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
