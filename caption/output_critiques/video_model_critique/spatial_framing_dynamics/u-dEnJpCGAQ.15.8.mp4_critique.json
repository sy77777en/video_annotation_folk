    "pre_caption": "A leopard is initially partially visible in the center-left middle ground, obscured by a large tree trunk. It emerges, moving from left to right across the frame. The camera pans slightly to the right, maintaining a medium shot of the leopard as it walks through the middle ground, which is covered in dry leaves and rocks. Other tree trunks are positioned in the foreground and middle ground. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A leopard with a yellowish-tan coat patterned with black rosettes and spots emerges from behind a thick tree trunk. The large cat has long, white whiskers and amber eyes. As it first appears, its face is scrunched, with its nose wrinkled and its teeth bared. It then walks forward with a steady gait, moving through the dry, leafy undergrowth.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dry, wooded area, a leopard with a spotted coat emerges from behind the thick, grey trunks of several trees. The ground is covered in a layer of brown, dry leaves, twigs, and scattered rocks. A small amount of green foliage is visible near the base of the trees. The leopard steps forward, briefly scrunching its face and baring its teeth, before continuing to walk deliberately through the undergrowth and across the uneven, leafy terrain.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
