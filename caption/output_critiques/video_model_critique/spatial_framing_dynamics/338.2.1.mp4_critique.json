    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of the subjects, capturing the woman from the waist up. The woman, Annie, is centrally positioned in the frame, occupying the middle ground. Her 2D position is centered horizontally and slightly lower vertically, aligning with the camera's height at her level. In the foreground, a plate of food and a glass with a lemon slice are placed directly in front of her, slightly to the left. To the right side of the frame, another person wearing a yellow garment is partially visible, situated in the same middle ground as Annie. The background includes tables with white tablecloths and wall art, providing depth to the scene. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial positions throughout the video. The camera remains static, maintaining a consistent perspective focused on the dining setup and the subjects.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a woman seated at a table, wearing a white shirt under a maroon vest with a name tag that reads \"Annie.\" She has a medium skin tone, her hair is tied back, and she is facing directly towards the camera with a neutral expression. In front of her is a plate of food, and a glass with a lemon slice is visible. To her left, partially visible, is another person wearing a yellow garment. The setting suggests a dining environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set indoors in a restaurant with a warm, inviting atmosphere. The setting features tables covered with white tablecloths, creating a formal dining environment. The lighting is soft, contributing to a cozy ambiance. Notable visual elements include a glass of lemonade with a slice of lemon and a plate of food, adding to the dining context. The walls are adorned with artwork, enhancing the restaurant's decor. The scene remains consistent throughout, maintaining a focus on the dining experience.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe caption is excellent. It is accurate, comprehensive, and strictly adheres to all the provided instructions. It successfully translates the visual information into a clear and objective textual description of the scene's spatial composition.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **Shot Size and Framing:** The identification of the \"medium shot\" capturing the woman from the waist up is perfectly accurate.\n*   **Subject Positioning:** The description of Annie's position as \"centrally positioned in the frame, occupying the middle ground\" is correct. The further detail about her being \"centered horizontally and slightly lower vertically\" is a precise and valuable observation.\n*   **Element Placement:** The placement of the foreground (plate, glass), middle ground (second person), and background elements (tables, art) is described accurately in both 2D and 3D space.\n*   **Camera and Movement:** The statements that the camera is at the subject's level and that the shot is static with no changes are both correct.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully covers all the required components: shot size, 2D position, 3D depth (foreground, middle ground, background), camera height, and spatial dynamics (or lack thereof).\n*   It effectively describes not just the main subject but also secondary subjects and key objects in the scene, providing a full picture of the spatial arrangement.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand.\n*   **Objectivity:** The description is entirely objective, avoiding any emotional, subjective, or speculative language (e.g., \"it appears,\" \"might be\").\n*   **Structure:** It is presented as a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or markdown, as requested.\n*   **Focus:** The focus remains strictly on the spatial framing and dynamics, without delving into the narrative or the character's emotions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis is a high-quality caption that perfectly fulfills the prompt's requirements. It demonstrates a strong understanding of cinematographic terms and the ability to apply them in a descriptive, objective manner. There are no corrections or significant improvements needed.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is a static, eye-level medium shot focused on a woman, Annie, who is centered in the middle ground. Her position is slightly below the vertical center of the frame. In the foreground, a plate of food and a glass sit on the table before her. To her right, another person in a yellow garment is partially visible, also in the middle ground. The background consists of other dining tables and wall art. The entire spatial composition is fixed throughout the shot.",
