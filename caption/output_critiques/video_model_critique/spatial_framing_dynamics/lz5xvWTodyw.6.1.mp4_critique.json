    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a wide shot, positioning a man in a dark coat carrying a suitcase in the center of the frame, walking within the middle ground. A wooden fence lines the right side of the frame, extending from the foreground to the middle ground, while bare trees occupy the middle ground and background. A streetlamp stands in the left middle ground. As the man walks toward the left, the camera, positioned at his level, pans to the right. This movement causes the man to shift to the left side of the frame before exiting it completely. The pan concludes by revealing a large, multi-story green house in the right background, situated behind the trees and fence. A small, white circular reticle remains fixed in the center of the screen throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man walking along a path lined with bare trees. He is wearing a dark coat and hat, carrying a brown suitcase. The scene is set in a dimly lit, possibly rainy environment. As the video progresses, the camera pans right, causing the man to eventually disappear from the frame. This movement reveals a large, multi-story building with numerous windows in the background, suggesting the man's destination or a significant location within the scene. The building is surrounded by a fence and additional trees, contributing to the overall atmosphere.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A gloomy, outdoor scene unfolds at night on a wet dirt road flanked by a dark wooden fence and a grove of bare, thin trees. The sky is overcast, and a light rain falls, creating puddles on the ground scattered with leaves. A single streetlamp on a wooden pole provides some illumination. As the view pans to the right, a large, multi-story house, painted dark green with a porch and lit windows, becomes visible behind the trees. A small, white circular reticle, an overlay element, is present in the center of the screen.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects disappearing from the frame**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subject. Then the subject disappears.\n\nBefore the subject disappears, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
