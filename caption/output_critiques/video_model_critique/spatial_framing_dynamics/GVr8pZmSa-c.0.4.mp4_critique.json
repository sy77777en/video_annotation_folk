    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot, where a wooden sailing ship is centrally positioned in the middle ground, occupying a significant portion of the frame. Turbulent ocean waves are visible in the foreground and middle ground, surrounding the vessel. Small, white humanoid figures are on the ship's deck; one is on the left side, and another is near the center-right. The camera is initially at the ship's level. The shot then transitions to a wide shot as the camera pulls back and moves to a higher vantage point, now positioned above the ship. In this wide shot, the ship, still in the center and middle ground, appears smaller and is shown tilting and becoming partially submerged by the dominant ocean waves that fill the foreground, middle ground, and background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a wooden sailing ship navigating through rough, turbulent ocean waters. The ship is characterized by its large, dark sails and detailed wooden structure, including a prominent deck and railings. On board, there are 3-4 white humanoid figures, adding a sense of life and activity to the scene. The vessel appears sturdy, with visible cabins and masts. The ocean is depicted with high, crashing waves, emphasizing the ship's struggle against the elements. The ship's orientation changes from being prominently visible to partially submerged, suggesting a challenging journey through the stormy sea.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a wooden sailing ship, featuring dark, unfurled sails and a railed deck, caught in a turbulent, dark blue ocean under dark, stormy skies. A few small, pale figures are visible on its deck. Large waves with dark blue water and white foam relentlessly batter the wooden vessel, causing it to rock violently and tilt precariously. The ship is progressively overwhelmed by the churning water, with its bow submerging first. Parts of the sails, mast, and the top of the cabin remain visible above the surface.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe provided caption is excellent. It is highly accurate, comprehensive, and perfectly adheres to all the given instructions. It successfully translates the visual and spatial dynamics of the video into a clear and concise descriptive paragraph.\n\n**Detailed Breakdown:**\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description is factually correct. It accurately identifies the subject (a wooden sailing ship), the environment (turbulent ocean), the key action (the ship tilting and being submerged), and the presence of small figures on deck.\n*   **Completeness & Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Shot Size:** Correctly identifies the shift from a `medium shot` to a `wide shot`.\n    *   **Spatial Position (2D & 3D):** The caption excels here. It correctly places the ship (`centrally`, `middle ground`), the waves (`foreground`, `middle ground`, and later `background`), and the figures (`left side`, `center-right`).\n    *   **Camera Height & Movement:** The description of the camera's initial position (`at the ship's level`) and its movement (`pulls back and moves to a higher vantage point, now positioned above the ship`) is precise and captures the dynamic change in perspective.\n    *   **Dynamics and Changes:** The caption clearly explains the transition, detailing how the ship's appearance (`appears smaller`) and the overall composition change as the camera moves and the shot becomes wider.\n    *   **Objectivity:** The language is objective and descriptive. It avoids emotional or speculative terms, sticking to what is visually present. Words like \"turbulent\" and \"dominant\" are used appropriately to describe the physical state and visual hierarchy, not to infer emotion.\n    *   **Formatting:** The output is a single, well-structured paragraph without any introductory text or markdown, as requested.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe caption is a model example of how to follow the instructions. It is detailed without being verbose and provides a thorough analysis of the scene's spatial composition and movement. No corrections or improvements are necessary.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a medium shot of a wooden sailing ship, centrally positioned in the middle ground and surrounded by turbulent ocean waves. Two small, white humanoid figures are visible on its deck—one on the left and another near the center-right. The camera, initially at the ship's level, pulls back and moves to a high-angle vantage point, transitioning the scene into a wide shot. From this higher perspective, the ship, still centered in the middle ground, appears smaller as it tilts and begins to be submerged by the dominant ocean waves that now fill the entire frame.",
