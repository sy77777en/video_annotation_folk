    "pre_caption": "The video starts with an extreme wide shot, capturing a vast, dark expanse with a small, illuminated circular pit in the center. Two individuals, both in white shirts, appear near the edge of the pit. Initially, they are positioned at the bottom of the frame, close to the center, in the foreground. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to a wide shot, bringing the subjects more into view while maintaining their central positioning. The two individuals lean over the pit, their upper bodies now more visible as they look downward. The camera remains consistently above the subjects throughout, providing a top-down perspective. The pit stays in the center of the frame, serving as the focal point, with the subjects positioned around its edge. The overall scene retains its minimalistic quality, with the dark surroundings and earthy textures emphasizing the central action. The camera's fixed overhead angle ensures a clear view of the subjects' movements and positions relative to the pit.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two individuals, both wearing white shirts, viewed from above. They are leaning over what appears to be the edge of a well, looking downward. **\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents an outdoor setting viewed from an objective perspective, focusing on a circular pit or well in the ground. The environment is earthy, with the ground appearing dark brown and textured, suggesting soil or dirt. The time of day is indeterminate due to the lack of natural light cues. The scene features two people in white clothing leaning over the edge of the pit. Most of the scene is quite dark, with only the central area being slightly illuminated. The setting is minimalistic, with no additional architectural or natural features visible. Overlay elements include small text in the bottom left corner displaying \"[8,12],\" which is not part of the scene itself.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with an extreme wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption inaccurately states that the two individuals \"appear\" and \"shift to the center,\" when in fact they are already present and centered from the start. The final sentence, \"The minimalistic scene, with its dark surroundings and earthy textures, emphasizes the central action,\" is interpretive and subjective, violating the instruction to describe only spatial framing and avoid such analysis. The description of the shot transition could be more precise by specifying that the camera zooms in. Additionally, the caption omits the relative positioning of the two subjects to each other (on opposite sides of the pit).",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video starts with a top-down extreme wide shot of a vast, dark expanse. In the center of the frame, two individuals in white shirts are positioned on opposite sides of a small, illuminated circular pit. As the video progresses, the camera slowly zooms in, transitioning to a wide shot that brings the subjects into clearer view while they remain centered. The two individuals then lean over the pit, their upper bodies becoming more visible as they look downward. The camera maintains a consistent overhead, top-down perspective throughout, keeping the pit and the subjects as the central focal point.",
