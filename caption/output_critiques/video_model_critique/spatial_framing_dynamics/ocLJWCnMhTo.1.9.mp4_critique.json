    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium full shot from a level angle, placing the main subject in the center-left foreground as they lean over another person in the center middle ground. To the right, a third individual occupies the middle ground, with other figures visible in the background. The camera then moves upward, shifting the perspective to a high-angle full shot that looks down on the scene. In this final framing, the group is clustered in the center of the frame on the black and white checkered floor, with the main subject's back now toward the camera as confetti falls over them from above.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject of this grainy, low-fidelity video is a person with fair skin and blonde, shoulder-length hair in a bowl cut, wearing a dark blue, short-sleeved collared shirt and a watch on their right wrist. This individual is the central focus, leaning forward with their hands resting on the shoulders of a person with dark skin in a blue t-shirt, as they are both showered with a large amount of white and colored confetti. Surrounding them are several other people participating in the celebration. To the right, a person with dark hair in a white graphic t-shirt and dark patterned pants raises their arms. Other less distinct figures are visible in the background, all clustered together in a celebratory moment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An indoor scene shifts from a level-angle perspective to a bird's eye view, looking down upon a black and white checkered floor. A shower of white and multicolored confetti continuously falls from above, blanketing the floor and the several people gathered in the room. The scene is illuminated with warm, slightly greenish lighting, creating a vintage film aesthetic. The entire video is presented within a black letterbox frame, with vignette overlays in the four corners.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to above the subject.",

The initial shot is described as being from a \"level angle,\" but it is more accurately a \"slightly high angle,\" as the camera is positioned above the subjects' eye level from the beginning, looking slightly down on them. Additionally, for greater objectivity, the \"main subject\" could be described more descriptively, for instance, as \"the person in the blue shirt.\"",
