    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, a silhouetted person is positioned in the center of the frame, suspended in the middle ground against a bright, starburst-like light source that is also centered in the background. The person slowly rotates counter-clockwise in place, their limbs drifting from an initial asymmetrical pose to a more spread-eagled position. The scene is captured from a low angle, with the camera positioned below the subject, looking upward.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A silhouetted person is seen floating in deep blue water. Initially viewed from below, the figure, who appears to be wearing a jacket and pants, begins to rotate as they float with their arms outstretched in a relaxed, slightly asymmetrical pose. Their shaggy hair is visible in outline against a brilliant, starburst-like blue light source positioned directly behind them. The intense backlighting obscures all details of their features and clothing, rendering them as a dark shape against the radiant glow.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From an underwater perspective looking upward, a scene is set in deep, dark blue water. A brilliant, singular light source shines down from above, casting radiant beams that create a starburst effect through the murky depths. Centered against this intense blue-white light is the dark silhouette of a fully clothed person, suspended and drifting slowly with limbs slightly outstretched. A few small, illuminated bubbles or particles are visible floating in the water.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned below the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly states that \"the person descends to the foreground.\" In the video, the person's distance from the camera remains relatively constant; they stay in the middle ground while rotating. The sentence \"As the scene progresses, the person descends to the foreground\" should be removed. The description of the movement can be integrated with the preceding sentence for better accuracy and flow, for instance: \"The person gradually turns counter-clockwise in the water, maintaining an asymmetrical pose and their position in the middle ground throughout.\"",
