    "pre_caption": "The video features a medium shot of a woman walking through a busy restaurant. The camera remains at her level, capturing her from behind as she moves forward. Initially, she is centered in the frame, occupying the middle ground. As she progresses, her position shifts slightly to the left while remaining in the middle ground. The tables and diners are distributed across the foreground and background, with some individuals seated on the left and others on the right. Notably, a man in a beige shirt is positioned in the foreground on the left side, gesturing with his hand. The restaurant's interior, with its warm lighting and decorative wooden panels, forms the backdrop, extending into the background. The camera maintains a steady perspective, keeping the woman as the focal point while showcasing the surrounding activity. There are no significant changes in shot size or camera height throughout the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a woman with long brown hair tied in a ponytail, wearing a white shirt, a maroon vest, and a blue backpack. She is the main subject, seen from behind as she walks through a busy restaurant. The setting includes several tables with people dining, contributing to a lively atmosphere. A man in a beige shirt is notable, sitting at a table and gesturing with his hand. The woman, who is a server, appears to be moving towards a table to serve food. The restaurant's interior is warmly lit, with decorative wooden panels and a bustling ambiance.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a third-person over-the-hip POV shot showing a character from waist height in an indoor setting, specifically a bustling restaurant. The environment features warm lighting with intricate wooden paneling and decorative elements on the walls, creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere. The ceiling is adorned with ornate designs, adding to the restaurant's traditional aesthetic. Tables are arranged throughout the space, occupied by patrons engaged in conversation and dining. The character, wearing a blue backpack and a white shirt, moves through the scene, interacting with the lively surroundings. The time of day is not explicitly indicated, but the indoor lighting suggests a well-lit, possibly evening setting. The overall ambiance is vibrant, with a mix of people and activity contributing to the dynamic scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions. It is accurate, comprehensive, and well-structured.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is highly accurate in its spatial descriptions. It correctly identifies the shot as a \"medium shot\" and notes the camera is \"at her level, capturing her from behind.\"\n*   The description of the woman's position (\"centered in the frame, occupying the middle ground\") and her subsequent movement (\"shifts slightly to the left while remaining in the middle ground\") is precise.\n*   The placement of other elements, such as the \"man in a beige shirt... in the foreground on the left side\" and the restaurant interior in the \"background,\" is spot-on.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The description is very thorough. It successfully covers all the required aspects of spatial framing: shot size, 2D position (left, center), 3D depth (foreground, middle ground, background), and camera height.\n*   It effectively describes the primary subject (the woman), a key secondary subject (the man), and the general environment (diners, interior), providing a complete picture of the scene's composition.\n*   It correctly notes the dynamic element (the woman walking forward) and the camera's corresponding movement (\"maintains a steady perspective, keeping the woman as the focal point\").\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Focus on Spatial Framing:** The caption excels here, making spatial analysis its central theme, just as requested.\n*   **Objectivity:** The language is objective and descriptive, avoiding emotional or speculative terms. \"Busy restaurant\" and \"warm lighting\" are acceptable descriptive inferences based on visual evidence.\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The caption is written in a single, coherent paragraph using clear and natural English. It conveys a lot of information without being overly dense or technical.\n*   **Structure:** It follows the logical flow requested by the instructions, starting with the shot size and main subject, then detailing the positions of various elements, and concluding with the overall dynamics.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe caption is a perfect example of how to follow the provided instructions. It is a high-quality, detailed, and accurate description of the video's spatial composition and dynamics. There are no significant errors or omissions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A medium shot, filmed from behind at eye level, follows a woman as she walks through a busy restaurant. Initially centered in the middle ground, she drifts slightly to the left as she moves forward. In the foreground to the left, a man in a beige shirt gestures, while other diners and tables occupy the surrounding foreground and background. The restaurant's interior, featuring warm lighting and decorative wood, serves as the backdrop. The camera maintains a steady perspective on the woman, with no changes in shot size or height throughout the clip.",
