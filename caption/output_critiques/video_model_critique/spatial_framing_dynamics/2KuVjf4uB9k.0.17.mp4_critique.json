    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a red sports car drifting along a winding desert road. Initially, the car is positioned slightly off-center towards the left in the middle ground, with the road curving away into the background. The car occupies a significant portion of the frame, allowing a clear view of its dynamic movement. As the video progresses, the car drifts sharply, moving from the left side of the frame towards the center-right while kicking up a dense cloud of white smoke from its rear tires. This transition emphasizes the car's speed and agility. The surrounding environment, consisting of arid terrain and sparse vegetation, remains in the background throughout the video, providing a stark contrast to the smooth road. The camera maintains a consistent aerial perspective, positioned above the car, capturing the full scope of the action and the expansive desert landscape. The camera's height relative to the car ensures a comprehensive view of the car's trajectory and the surrounding scenery, highlighting the car's interaction with the winding road.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a red sports car prominently drifting on a winding desert road. The car is sleek and aerodynamic, with visible decals and a spoiler on the back. It emits a thick cloud of white smoke from its tires, indicating high-speed motion and sharp turns. The road is surrounded by arid, sandy terrain with sparse vegetation, enhancing the sense of speed and agility as the car maneuvers through the curves. The car's dynamic movement and the smoke trail are central to the scene, emphasizing the action and skill involved in the driving.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a drone POV, showcases a dynamic scene set on a winding desert road. The environment is arid, with sparse vegetation and sandy terrain surrounding the asphalt. The time of day appears to be midday, with clear skies and bright sunlight casting sharp shadows. A red car is prominently featured, drifting around the curves of the road, creating plumes of smoke that trail behind it. The motion of the car and the dust it kicks up emphasize the speed and agility of the vehicle as it navigates the barren landscape. The drone's perspective provides a sweeping view of the scene, highlighting the contrast between the smooth road and the rugged desert backdrop.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption.\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is mostly accurate in its description of the scene's core elements. It correctly identifies the shot size as a \"wide shot,\" the subject as a \"red sports car,\" the action as \"drifting,\" and the setting as a \"winding desert road.\" However, the description of the car's movement is not entirely accurate. It states the car moves \"from the left side of the frame towards the center-right,\" which implies a static camera. In the video, the camera is actively tracking the car, keeping it relatively centered as it moves through the curve. The car's position *within the frame* remains fairly constant, while the background moves past it. The caption also uses the subjective term \"agility,\" which is an interpretation of the car's performance rather than a description of its spatial movement, violating the instruction to avoid subjective adjectives.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is incomplete as it misses a key spatial event. Around the 00:01 mark, the car's trunk lid pops open. This is a significant and visible change to the subject's physical state and should be included in a comprehensive description of the spatial dynamics.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Spatial Framing:** The initial positioning (\"slightly off-center towards the left in the middle ground\") and the description of the camera height (\"aerial perspective, positioned above the car\") are well-described and follow the instructions.\n    *   **Conciseness:** The paragraph is somewhat repetitive. The final two sentences largely restate the same point about the high-angle aerial view. They could be combined into a single, more concise statement. For example: \"The camera maintains a high-angle aerial perspective, tracking above the car to capture its movement along the winding road within the expansive desert landscape.\"\n    *   **Objectivity:** The use of \"dynamic movement\" and \"emphasizes the car's speed and agility\" introduces a subjective and interpretive layer, which the instructions advise against. The description should focus purely on the observable spatial facts.\n\nIn summary, the caption provides a good foundation but needs refinement. It should more accurately describe the car's movement relative to the tracking camera, include the detail of the trunk opening, and be edited for conciseness and objectivity to fully align with the provided instructions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is a high-angle aerial shot of a red sports car on a winding road in a desert environment. The video begins with the car, seen from the rear, drifting sideways through a left-hand curve while generating a large cloud of white smoke from its tires. As the car proceeds through the turn, its trunk lid pops open. The camera tracks the car's movement from above, keeping it relatively centered in the lower portion of the frame as the arid, hilly terrain passes in the background.",
