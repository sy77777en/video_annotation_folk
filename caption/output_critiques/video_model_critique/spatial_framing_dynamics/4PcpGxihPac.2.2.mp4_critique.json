    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a person is positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. Behind them, dark, vertically corrugated panels form the background. In the blurred foreground, scientific apparatus is visible on the left and right, creating a sense of depth. The person, initially with their arms down, raises both hands to shoulder height with their palms facing forward. The camera remains stationary at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person with a muscular build and blonde hair is seen from the back, wearing a black harness with two straps over their shoulders. They raise their hands to shoulder height with palms facing forward.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor setting that resembles a laboratory, a person with blonde hair is seen from behind. Their shirtless back, marked by black straps over the shoulders, is illuminated by a cool, blue light from an unseen source in front of them. The background consists of dark, vertically corrugated panels. In the blurred foreground, various pieces of scientific apparatus are visible.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption provides a detailed and accurate description that fully adheres to all instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the shot as a \"medium shot\" and precisely places the subject in the \"center of the frame\" and \"middle ground.\"\n*   The description of the background (\"dark, vertically corrugated panels\") and the \"blurred foreground\" with \"scientific apparatus\" is spot-on.\n*   The description of the action is precise, noting the initial state (\"arms down\") and the final state (\"raises both hands to shoulder height with their palms facing forward\").\n*   The statement about the stationary camera at the subject's level is also correct.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is very complete. It successfully addresses all the required elements: shot size, 2D position (center), 3D position (foreground, middle ground, background), camera height, and the spatial dynamics of the subject's movement.\n*   It effectively uses the foreground and background elements to establish and describe the scene's depth.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   The caption perfectly follows the instructions. It is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English.\n*   It avoids subjective adjectives, speculation, and any information not visible in the video.\n*   It focuses entirely on the spatial framing and dynamics as requested.\n\nOverall, this is an exemplary caption that demonstrates a thorough understanding and application of the provided guidelines.",
