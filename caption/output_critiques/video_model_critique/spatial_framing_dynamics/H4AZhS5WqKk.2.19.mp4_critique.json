    "pre_caption": "This video begins with a ground-level wide shot where a beige door occupies the center-middle ground. An animated mouse is seen in mid-air on the right side of the frame, arcing towards the left in the middle ground, propelled by an impact. Simultaneously, an animated cat's head smashes through the center of the door from the background, coming to a stop in the middle ground as debris flies towards the foreground. The shot then cuts to a medium close-up, centered on the cat's head now stuck in the door. In this final framing, the camera is positioned slightly below the cat's head, looking up at it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video features two animated characters interacting with a door. A small, brown mouse with a tan face, large pink ears, and a long tail is shown arcing through the air. Simultaneously, the head of a blue-grey cat with yellow eyes, pink inner ears, a white muzzle, and black whiskers smashes through the door, becoming stuck in the resulting hole. The cat has an angry expression, with furrowed brows and bared white teeth.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Filmed from a ground-level perspective, the scene is set indoors on a light-colored tiled floor. A beige, paneled door with a silver handle is central to the view. To the right of the door, a shelf contains a stack of folded white towels. A cartoon mouse is shown in mid-air, arcing from right to left and shuts the door, causing a cartoon cat's head to burst through the wood, creating a splintered hole. Additionally, the wall on the left side of the door appears to be transparent.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a ground-level shot of an animated brown mouse (Jerry) standing in front of a door frame and running into a room through a partially open door. As the mouse slams the door shut, an animated blue cat (Tom)’s head collides with it, creating a large hole. Realistic door fragments burst outward, emphasizing the impact. The collision causes the mouse to bounce slightly upward in the frame before quickly scurrying away. The camera then shifts to focus on the cat’s angry head protruding through the hole in the door.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera starts at the height of the mouse (Jerry). As Jerry slams the door on the cat (Tom), the camera shifts focus to Tom, moving slightly upward while remaining just below his head.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly states the door \"becomes the background\" when it closes; the door is already the main element in the middle ground and simply becomes a solid surface. The phrase \"to shut the door\" is a speculative statement about the mouse's intent, which should be avoided in favor of describing the observable action. Additionally, the caption omits a visible element: the smashed decoration at the top-center of the door at the start of the video. The description of the final shot could also be integrated more smoothly. A more accurate description would state that the mouse's movement causes the door to swing shut and would include the smashed decoration in the initial scene setup.",

An animated mouse is seen in mid-air on the right, arcing towards the left. Simultaneously, an animated cat's head smashes through the center of the door, sending debris flying towards the camera. The shot then cuts to a low-angle medium close-up, focusing on the cat's furious expression as his head is now stuck in the jagged hole in the door.",
