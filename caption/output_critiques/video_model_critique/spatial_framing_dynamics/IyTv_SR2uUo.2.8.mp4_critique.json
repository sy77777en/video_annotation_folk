    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot of a woman centered in the foreground, with the camera positioned at her level against a background of a vast, hilly landscape. The shot rapidly transitions as she falls, becoming a full shot that keeps her centered in the foreground. Concurrently, the camera's position changes to be above her, capturing a high-angle view of her entire body as the ground far below fills the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young, light-skinned woman with dark brown hair tied back is shown from a high-angle, locked-on perspective. She is wearing a bright yellow helmet with \"GoPro BE A HERO.\" and \"KORDA'S\" written on it, a pink top, and a green and black safety harness over her clothes. Her facial expression shifts from a wide, teeth-baring smile to an open-mouthed look of surprise or a scream as she is suspended in the air, clapping her hands a few times.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot, captured from a helmet-mounted camera, shows a person in mid-air over a vast, sunlit valley during the day. The camera, mounted on the woman's helmet, moves in sync with her head movements. It first pans left as she turns her body, then tilts down while rolling counterclockwise as she looks upward, offering a dynamic view of the expansive, hilly terrain covered in green and brown scrub with rocky outcrops. In the distance, a small cluster of buildings and a winding body of water are visible under a clear blue sky. The person wears a bright yellow helmet with black and white text overlays reading \"GoPro\" and \"BE A HERO\" in white against a black background, and \"KORDA'S\" in black with the apostrophe in red, and is secured in a harness.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The description of the transition is inaccurate. The caption states the woman \"turns her body and looks upward,\" but the video shows the camera's perspective changing from a frontal view to a high-angle, top-down view as she falls or swings. At the end of the transition, she is looking down into the camera, which is now positioned above her. To correct this, the description of the transition should focus on the camera's movement. The phrase \"as she turns her body and looks upward, becoming a full shot\" should be revised to more accurately describe the camera's pivot, for instance: \"The shot rapidly transitions as the camera pivots from this frontal view to a high-angle position directly above her, reframing her into a full shot.\"",
