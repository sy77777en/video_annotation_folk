    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective, a pink hand occupies the bottom right foreground, holding a large pink phone that is centered in the frame. The background consists of a black-and-white checkered floor in the middle ground, with a blue and yellow globe positioned in the left middle ground and other geometric shapes further in the background. Within the frame of the phone's screen, a green, multi-eyed creature is positioned in the left and center middle ground, while one of its tentacles extends into the foreground to draw on a piece of paper located in the bottom right of the screen. The overall framing of the scene remains static throughout the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a surreal, animated scene, a pink-skinned hand holds a large, pink smartphone-like device. The device's screen displays an image of a large, green, brain-like creature with three large, yellow, pupil-less eyes, and numerous writhing tentacles. One of the creature's long, snake-like tentacles holds a yellow pencil with a red eraser and is shown drawing a diagram on a pink piece of paper that rests on a red desk. The drawing itself consists of black lines, circles, and a human figure. The entire scene is set against a black-and-white checkered floor, populated with other colorful, abstract objects, including a globe composed of two shades of blue on a yellow stand.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a first-person perspective, a pink hand holds a large, pink smartphone in a surreal room with a black-and-white checkerboard floor. In the background, various abstract objects are visible, including a globe in two shades of blue on a yellow stand and other colorful geometric shapes. The phone's screen displays an animated scene of a green, brain-like creature with three yellow eyes and numerous tentacles. The creature is positioned at a red desk, using one of its tentacles to hold a yellow pencil and draw a diagram on a piece of paper. The phone's interface shows a status bar with several icons and a line of stylized, unreadable text.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption omits the key spatial dynamic at the beginning of the video: a quick zoom-out from a close-up on the phone to reveal the wider scene. The description should begin by noting this movement. The positioning of the main subject is also imprecise; it should state that the hand is in the right foreground while the phone it holds is in the central foreground. Furthermore, the caption lacks 3D depth for the background elements; it should specify that the globe is in the middle ground and the other shapes are in the background. Finally, it should mention that the camera is positioned from a first-person perspective, looking slightly downward.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The shot begins with a close-up on a large pink phone before quickly zooming out to reveal a wider, surreal scene. From a first-person perspective looking slightly downward, a pink hand in the right foreground holds the phone, which is centered in the foreground. The background consists of a black-and-white checkered floor. A blue and yellow globe sits in the left middle ground, with other colorful geometric shapes positioned further in the background. On the phone's screen, a green, multi-eyed, tentacled creature is drawing on a piece of paper with one of its tentacles. After the initial zoom, the framing of the scene remains static.",
