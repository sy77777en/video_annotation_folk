    "pre_caption": "This is a medium shot, showing the upper bodies of two individuals in protective suits. The primary subject, holding a long-handled tool with a glass beaker, is positioned in the center-right of the frame in the middle ground. The tool extends towards the center-left, aiming for a square, metallic container also in the middle ground, positioned to the left of the primary subject. A second individual, similarly attired, is visible to the left and slightly in the background relative to the first, holding a cylindrical object near the left edge of the square container, also in the middle ground. On the far right of the frame, a complex laboratory setup with glassware occupies the middle ground, extending slightly into the background. The entire scene is set against a black background. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two individuals, their upper bodies visible, clad in identical white, full-body protective suits complete with hoods, light blue surgical-style face masks, and transparent eye protection. The person positioned more centrally and slightly to the right holds a long-handled tool; this tool has a green section near its base and a clear glass beaker clamped at its end. They appear to be maneuvering this beaker towards a square, metallic, reflective container situated to their left. The second individual, located to the left and slightly in the background, wears the same protective attire and holds a cylindrical, possibly metallic, object in their right hand, near the edge of the square container. On the far right of the scene, a complex laboratory setup is visible, comprising various pieces of glassware such as round-bottom flasks and tubing, all mounted on a support stand; some of these flasks contain liquids.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set against a black background, suggesting an indoor, controlled environment, possibly a laboratory. Two figures are visible, both clad in white, full-body protective suits with hoods, blue surgical masks, and goggles covering their faces. The figure on the right is more prominent and is manipulating a long, metallic tool with a green handle. At the end of this tool is a clear, cylindrical glass container. To the left, a second, similarly attired figure stands slightly behind, holding a metallic object. Between them and slightly to the left is a square, metallic container filled with a swirling, iridescent liquid. On the far right, a complex arrangement of laboratory glassware, including flasks and tubing, is visible. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays a timestamp \"[23]\".**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The scene depicts a laboratory with a black background and two individuals dressed in protective suits. Both of them show their upper bodies. The one in the center is holding an object with a glass beaker, attempting to put it on a square object. On the right side, a support structure holds various chemical substances.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The description of the second individual's spatial position is inaccurate and could be more precise. The caption states this individual is holding an object \"also in the foreground,\" which is incorrect. The individual is positioned behind the foreground container, placing them in the middle ground. Additionally, they are holding the object *over* the container, not just \"near\" it. To correct this, the sentence \"A second individual, similarly attired, is visible to the left and slightly in the background relative to the first, holding a cylindrical object near the left edge of the square container, also in the foreground\" should be revised to something like: \"A second individual is positioned in the middle ground on the left, behind the container, holding a cylindrical object over it.\"",
