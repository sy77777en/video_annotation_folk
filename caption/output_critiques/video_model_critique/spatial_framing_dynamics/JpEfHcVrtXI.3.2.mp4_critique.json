    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a low-angle full shot, where a large, three-headed creature occupies the top center of the frame in the middle ground, framed by two tall, glowing pillars in the foreground on the left and right. The camera then pulls back and lowers, transitioning into a wide tracking shot. In this new perspective, a character on a motorcycle appears in the foreground at the bottom center, moving forward along a path. The three-headed creature is now positioned in the center of the frame in the middle ground, moving away from the rider. As the scene progresses, circular obstacles appear in the middle ground on the path, and a score display remains fixed in the top left corner of the frame. The camera follows the rider from behind at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a stylized, low-poly world, a humanoid character wearing a blue jacket and dark pants rides a futuristic motorcycle of a light green-cyan color. This character is positioned behind and faces a large, quadrupedal, three-headed, wolf-like creature composed of geometric shapes in light blue, blue-violet, and white, with the entire head glowing. At one point, a red, circular indicator appears when the creature launches a small missile. Light blue, circular, spiky obstacles also appear on the path in front of the rider. The scene's color palette shifts between dark blue and vibrant magenta, but these changes do not alter the appearance of the subjects.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person 3D game video takes place in a stylized, dark forest at night. The scene is rendered in a low-poly aesthetic, with a color palette that shifts between deep blues and teals to a vibrant, saturated magenta. Tall, angular trees with glowing, stylized leaves line a dark path, where small, glowing lanterns hang from strings between the trees. A large, light blue, multi-headed, wolf-like creature with glowing heads moves along the path. The air is filled with floating, glowing, stylized leaf-like shapes. An overlay in the top left corner displays a changing score in a digital font, transitioning from purple with a flickering effect to a dynamically changing mix of purple, yellow, green, and other colors.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly describes the initial camera angle and movement. The video begins with a low-angle shot looking up at the creature, not a level-angle shot. The camera does not tilt up and down; rather, it moves forward as the creature jumps over its position. The description of the creature \"nearly filling the entire screen\" is an overstatement, as it primarily occupies the top half of the frame. The transition is not just a simple transition but a very quick, stylized cut that completely changes the perspective. The description should be corrected to state that the video opens with a low-angle shot of the creature jumping over the camera, followed by a quick cut to a tracking shot from behind the rider.",
