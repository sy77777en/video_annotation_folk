    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of an urban staircase at night, capturing the full length of the stairs and the surrounding architectural elements. Initially, several individuals are seen descending the staircase, positioned in the middle ground and occupying various points across the frame. Their movement is from the top towards the bottom of the stairs, transitioning from the upper part of the frame to the lower part. As they move, their positions shift from the center and right side of the frame to eventually exiting the scene. The camera remains stationary, maintaining a consistent perspective from the bottom of the stairs looking upwards. After the individuals leave the frame, the focus shifts entirely to the empty staircase and its surroundings. The staircase occupies the central portion of the frame, with railings on both sides extending into the background. The surrounding urban environment, including buildings and railings, forms the backdrop, situated in the upper part of the frame. The camera's height is slightly below the level of the subjects, providing a clear view of their descent and the architectural details of the staircase. The transition from populated to empty maintains the same wide shot, emphasizing the structural and design elements of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a few random individuals walking on a staircase in an urban setting at night. They are dressed in casual clothing, including jackets and pants, and all are wearing face masks. The area is well-lit with artificial lighting, indicating a public space. The scene then transitions to an empty view of the staircase and surrounding railings, emphasizing the architectural features like the tiled steps and metal railings. The setting is a modern, urban environment with a focus on the structure and design of the staircase.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video offers a first-person POV shot in a bustling urban outdoor setting at night, likely a transportation hub. The scene showcases a modern architectural environment with a staircase leading up to a platform, possibly a pedestrian overpass. The stairs are composed of gray tiles with a textured surface, and the area is softly illuminated by white lights along the railings. Surrounding structures include sleek, contemporary buildings with glass and metal elements, reflecting the city lights. The dark sky indicates nighttime, and the atmosphere is lively with several people walking, some wearing masks. Text overlays in the lower left corner read \"VIRTUAL. JAPAN. TV.\"**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption omits the crucial low-angle perspective of the camera, which is positioned at the bottom of the stairs looking up at the subjects. The description of the subjects' movement as \"moving from the middle and right side of the frame\" is imprecise; they begin in the upper-center and upper-right of the frame and move down toward the foreground. The statement that the \"surrounding urban environment, including buildings and railings, forms the backdrop\" is inaccurate, as the railings are prominent framing elements extending from the foreground to the mid-ground. The final sentence is slightly wordy. The caption should be revised to:\n\nFrom a low-angle perspective, the video presents a wide shot of a broad urban staircase at night, which extends from the bottom of the frame into the mid-ground. Several individuals are positioned in the upper-center and upper-right of the frame, descending the stairs from the mid-ground toward the foreground before exiting on the right. Simultaneously, the camera moves forward and ascends the staircase. The shot concludes on the landing, which fills the lower half of the frame, while background architecture occupies the upper half.",
