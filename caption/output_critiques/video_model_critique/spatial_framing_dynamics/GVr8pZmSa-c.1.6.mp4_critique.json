    "pre_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot. A smaller, rectangular rod with rounded edges is positioned in the foreground, vertically oriented in the bottom center of the frame and extending towards the center. Behind this rod, in the middle ground, a large, curved, silvery metallic structure occupies the majority of the frame, extending from the bottom towards the top. The background consists of a textured, light blue-grey surface visible at the top of the frame. The framing remains static throughout the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A detailed view reveals a large, metallic structure with a silvery-white surface. Its surface is adorned with numerous small, raised elements that resemble letters, arranged in intricate rows and patterns, alongside horizontal bands featuring repeating square indentations. The metal exhibits a reflective quality with some areas showing a weathered or slightly corroded texture. In the foreground, a smaller, rectangular rod with rounded edges and a rough, somewhat corroded metallic surface partially obscures the larger structure. This object resembles a very old and special clock.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot, with the camera fixed to a silvery, rectangular foreground object with rounded edges, offers a close perspective of a large, curved, silvery metallic structure. This reflective structure is detailed with horizontal bands; the uppermost band features numerous small, raised rectangular elements in rows, while lower bands have repeating rectangular indentations. A textured, light blue-grey surface forms the background, and the scene is dimly illuminated by a cool light.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: Lacking background information makes it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "Your feedback on the caption is as follows:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the shot as a close-up and precisely describes the visual elements: the foreground rod, the middle-ground metallic structure, and the background surface. The descriptions of their shapes (\"rectangular rod with rounded edges,\" \"curved... structure\"), materials (\"silvery metallic\"), and colors (\"light blue-grey\") are all based directly on the visual evidence.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is mostly complete according to the instructions. It successfully covers shot size, the 2D position of elements within the frame (bottom center, top), their 3D depth (foreground, middle ground, background), and the lack of movement (\"framing remains static\"). However, it omits one key detail requested in the instructions: the camera's height relative to the subject. The shot is clearly a low-angle shot, with the camera positioned below the main structure, looking up at it.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres well to most of the rules. It is a concise, single paragraph written in simple, natural English. It avoids emotional adjectives, speculation, and ambiguity. Its primary failure is not including the camera's height/angle, which was a specific requirement.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is very good but incomplete. It provides a strong and accurate description of the spatial composition but misses the crucial element of the camera's low-angle perspective, which significantly contributes to the sense of scale and framing in the scene. Adding a phrase like \"The camera is positioned at a low angle, looking up at the structure\" would make the description fully compliant and more comprehensive.",
