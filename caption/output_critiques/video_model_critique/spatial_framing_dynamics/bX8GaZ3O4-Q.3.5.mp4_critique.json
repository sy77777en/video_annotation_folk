    "pre_caption": "The video presents a static, level close-up of a handgun positioned diagonally from the bottom left to the center-right in the middle ground. In the foreground, two bullets are situated at the bottom right, while a portion of a glass is visible in the middle ground on the left. A small frog enters the frame from the top right, landing on the gun's trigger guard in the center. After a brief pause, the frog leaps out of the frame toward the top left.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A black, metallic semi-automatic handgun lies on its side on a dark wooden surface, its form highlighted by cool blue light. In the foreground, next to the gun, are two brass-cased bullets with silver-colored tips. Midway through the scene, a vibrant butterfly enters from the top right corner, flutters briefly toward the bottom left, and then exits the frame. Following this, a small, brightly colored tree frog with a yellow back, a white underside, and pinkish-red limbs hops into view from the top right edge. The frog, notable for its large red eyes with dark brown irises and a reddish-tinged sclera, lands on the gun's trigger guard. It pauses momentarily, glances upward toward the top left, and then leaps off toward the top left edge, disappearing from sight.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor setting, a black semi-automatic pistol with a metallic sheen rests on a dark wooden surface. The scene is cast in a cool, deep blue light, with a cut-glass tumbler containing an amber liquid partially visible to the left. Around the midpoint of the video, a colorful butterfly enters from the top right corner of the frame and flits toward the bottom left, appearing only briefly. Following this, a small, brightly colored yellow and green tree frog with red eyes appears on the slide of the pistol before vanishing. Two brass-cased bullets are positioned in the lower right foreground of the frame, near the firearm.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video starts with a full shot of a handgun, with two bullets in the foreground. A butterfly then flies across the frame. After that, a frog jumps onto the gun's trigger, stays for a moment, and jumps out of the frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains significant factual errors and inaccuracies. First, it incorrectly identifies the creature as a \"colorful butterfly\" and then describes a \"small frog\" as a second, separate creature. The video only features one animal: a small, colorful frog. The description of the creature \"fluttering\" is also incorrect; the frog appears suddenly on the gun. Additionally, the term \"full shot\" is not appropriate for a close-up of an object; \"close-up shot\" would be more accurate. The caption should be revised to describe the single appearance of the frog, correcting its species, its movement onto the gun, and the shot size.",

To the left is a glass of amber liquid, and to the right are two bullets. A small, colorful frog with a yellow-green body suddenly lands on the gun's trigger guard. It pauses briefly before leaping away and out of the frame.",
