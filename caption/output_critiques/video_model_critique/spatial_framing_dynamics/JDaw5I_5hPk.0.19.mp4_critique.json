    "pre_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot where a paved, two-lane road occupies the foreground and middle ground, entering from the bottom of the frame and curving from the left toward the right. A dark-colored sedan is positioned in the middle ground, slightly left of center, driving along the road toward the camera. The scene is dominated by a dense forest of towering trees that fill the background and both the left and right sides of the frame, with a particularly massive tree trunk standing in the right middle ground. On a small embankment in the right middle ground, next to the road, is a yellow and black striped sign. Sunlight filters through the canopy, casting patches of light and shadow across the road and the surrounding foliage. The camera is static and positioned at a low height on the side of the road.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a forest scenery shot depicting a paved, two-lane road curving through a dense redwood forest. Massive, ancient redwood trees with thick, dark trunks tower over the scene, their immense scale creating a cathedral-like atmosphere as sunlight filters through the high canopy, casting bright patches and deep shadows across the road and the lush green undergrowth. A dark-colored sedan drives along the road, its presence highlighting the vastness of the surrounding trees. There is no single main subject, as the focus is on capturing the majestic and immersive atmosphere of the ancient forest. The composition emphasizes the scale of the natural environment rather than any specific object within it. The car acts as a point of reference, underscoring the grandeur of the landscape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A paved, two-lane road with yellow center lines curves through a dense forest of towering trees with massive, dark-barked trunks. Sunlight filters through the thick green canopy, creating patches of light and shadow on the asphalt and the lush undergrowth of ferns and other foliage lining the roadside. A yellow and black striped chevron sign stands on a small embankment on the right, indicating the curve. A dark-colored sedan is seen driving along the road, approaching from around the bend.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly states the road enters from the \"bottom of the frame\"; it should be specified as entering from the bottom left. Additionally, while the caption mentions the car is driving toward the camera, it omits the change in its 2D position within the frame. The description should be updated to include that as the car moves forward, it also travels from the left of center toward the center of the frame, following the road's curve.",
