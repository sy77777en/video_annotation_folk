    "pre_caption": "The video features a close-up shot of a wooden cutting board, with the camera positioned above the subject. The primary focus is on a person's hands slicing a cucumber into thin, half-moon pieces using a large knife. The hands and knife are positioned in the top right of the frame, in the foreground, emphasizing the cutting action. As the slicing progresses, cucumber slices accumulate in the center and left of the board, transitioning from the top right to the center and left, remaining in the foreground. Fresh vegetables, including a red tomato, green lettuce, and a green onion, are arranged neatly in the bottom foreground, spanning from the bottom left to the bottom right. These elements remain static throughout the video, providing a colorful backdrop to the dynamic slicing action. The overall composition highlights the preparation of fresh ingredients in a clean and organized kitchen setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a close-up of a wooden cutting board with a person slicing a cucumber into thin, half-moon pieces using a large knife. The person's hands are visible, focusing on the cutting action. In the foreground, there are fresh vegetables, including a red tomato, a bunch of green lettuce, and a green onion, arranged neatly. The scene emphasizes the preparation of fresh ingredients, with the cucumber slices accumulating on the board as the cutting progresses.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents an overhead POV shot of a kitchen setting, focusing on a wooden cutting board where cucumbers are being sliced. The environment is indoors, with a clear view of fresh vegetables, including a vibrant red tomato, crisp green lettuce, and a green onion, arranged around the board. The cucumbers are cut into semi-circular slices, their green skin contrasting with the pale interior. The scene is well-lit, highlighting the natural colors and textures of the vegetables. The motion of slicing is central, with a hand holding a knife, emphasizing the preparation process. The overall atmosphere is clean and organized, typical of a culinary workspace.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies all the main subjects (hands, knife, cucumber, other vegetables) and the primary action (slicing). The description of the cucumber being cut into \"half-moon pieces\" and the identification of the other vegetables are precise.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is very complete and thoroughly addresses all the requirements of the instructions. It specifies the shot size (close-up), camera height (positioned above), 2D position of elements (top right, center, left, bottom), 3D depth (foreground), and the spatial dynamics (cucumber slices accumulating and transitioning across the board while other vegetables remain static).\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres well to the instructions, with a few minor points for improvement:\n*   **Strengths:** The description of spatial framing and dynamics is excellent. The sentence, \"As the slicing progresses, cucumber slices accumulate in the center and left of the board, transitioning from the top right to the center and left,\" is a perfect example of describing spatial movement as requested. The structure is logical, starting with the overall shot and then detailing the positions and movements of individual elements.\n*   **Areas for Improvement:** The caption includes some minor subjective or interpretive language, which the instructions advise against.\n    *   Words like \"neatly\" and \"colorful backdrop\" are interpretive. While descriptive, they add a layer of analysis rather than pure spatial description.\n    *   The final sentence, \"The overall composition highlights the preparation of fresh ingredients in a clean and organized kitchen setting,\" is the weakest part. It makes an assumption about the \"kitchen setting\" which is not fully visible, and words like \"clean\" and \"organized\" are subjective judgments. This sentence summarizes the theme rather than the spatial framing.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is excellent and demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions. It provides a detailed, accurate, and well-structured description of the scene's spatial composition and dynamics. To be perfect, it should remove the final interpretive sentence and slightly rephrase the subjective adjectives to be more neutral, sticking strictly to what is visually present.",
