    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot, framing a man from the waist up, positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. He is seated on a rug, which occupies the bottom foreground, placed on a wooden platform that extends from the foreground to the middle ground. He holds an iPad in the center middle ground. To his right, in the middle ground, is a small potted tree. Colorful animated features are visible on the walls in the background, with one on the left and another on the right. The cityscape forms the distant background. The camera is initially at the subject's level. The man then closes the iPad, places it on the platform in the center middle ground, and lies down on his back. Simultaneously, the camera pulls back and ascends, transitioning to an extreme wide shot from a position above the subject. In this final view, the man on the rug is now a smaller figure in the center middle ground, with a broader perspective of the rooftop, including ventilation units on the right middle ground, and the surrounding cityscape in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with dark dreadlocks, wearing a red and white patterned short-sleeved shirt under an olive-green quilted vest and blue jeans, is initially seen sitting on a rug placed on a wooden platform on a rooftop. He is using an iPad with a black cover. He then closes the iPad, places it on the platform, and lies down on his back on the rug with his arms placed behind his head.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone shows a person on a city rooftop during the day. The rooftop is concrete with a wooden platform covered by a striped brown and beige rug. Cream-colored, crenellated walls surround the rooftop. In the background, a cityscape with numerous buildings is visible under a clear blue sky. Large, colorful, abstract animated features are displayed on the rooftop walls; one features a traffic light design, and another displays a cartoonish character with the words \"YUM! ENJOY Cola!\". A small potted tree and another small plant are also on the rooftop, along with cables and ventilation units. The drone camera gradually pulls back and ascends, offering a wider view of the rooftop and the surrounding urban environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to an extreme wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is mostly accurate but can be improved for precision and completeness. The initial framing of the man is described as \"from the waist up,\" but it is more accurately \"from the thighs up\" since his seated legs are visible. The second animated feature is positioned in the center-right of the frame, not \"in the middle.\" The caption also omits a large gas tank visible on the far left in the middle ground at the start of the video. Finally, for greater objectivity, the specific term \"iPad\" should be replaced with the more general term \"tablet.\"",
