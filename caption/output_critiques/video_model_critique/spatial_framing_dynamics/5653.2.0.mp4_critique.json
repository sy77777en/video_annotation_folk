    "pre_caption": "The video commences with a medium full shot, showcasing a shirtless man positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. Dark, paneled walls are visible across the background. The shot then transitions to a medium shot as the man, remaining in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, brings his hands together in front of his lower abdomen. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout this sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A shirtless man with dark skin, short dark hair, and a short dark beard and mustache stands facing the camera. He wears black shorts and a thin gold chain necklace. Initially, his hands are down in front of him, and then he brings them together in front of his lower abdomen, with his thumbs and index fingers touching to form a diamond shape, while looking directly at the camera.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dimly lit, spacious indoor area with dark, possibly metallic, paneled walls in the background. The lighting is focused, creating a spotlight effect on the central area while the surroundings remain in shadow. The overall atmosphere is stark and minimalist.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

The description of a shot size transition should be removed. Instead, the caption should state that within a continuous medium shot, the man changes his posture and hand position.",
