    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium close-up shot of the woman, capturing her from the chest up. She is positioned centrally in the frame, occupying the foreground. Her 2D position is directly in the center, while her 3D position places her in the foreground, with the floral-patterned wallpaper and framed picture in the background. The camera is at her eye level, providing a direct view of her face and upper body. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to a close-up, focusing more tightly on her face and upper shoulders. In this close-up, her 2D position remains central, but the background elements become less prominent due to the tighter framing. The camera maintains its position at her eye level throughout the transition. There are no other significant changes in spatial positioning or camera height.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a woman with medium-length dark hair, wearing thin-framed glasses. She is dressed in a teal top, and a strap over her shoulder suggests she might be wearing denim overalls. Her expression is neutral, and she is facing forward. The lighting highlights her facial features, and she appears to be in a calm, indoor setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set indoors, featuring a warmly lit room with floral-patterned wallpaper and a framed picture on the wall. The setting suggests a cozy, intimate environment. The lighting is soft, creating a calm atmosphere. A person is present, wearing a teal top and glasses, positioned centrally in the scene. The background includes subtle decorative elements, contributing to the room's homely feel. The overall composition remains consistent, focusing on the person within this domestic setting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on this caption. It is highly accurate and detailed. Here is a breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is entirely accurate. It correctly identifies the initial shot as a medium close-up, the subject's central position in the foreground, the background elements, the eye-level camera angle, and the transition to a tighter close-up while maintaining the central framing and camera height.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe description is very thorough. It successfully covers all the required elements from the instructions, including shot size, 2D and 3D positioning of the subject and background elements, camera height, and the dynamic change within the shot.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption adheres well to the guidelines, but there are minor areas for improvement:\n*   **Conciseness:** The description is slightly repetitive. For instance, \"She is positioned centrally in the frame\" and \"Her 2D position is directly in the center\" convey the same information. Combining these statements would make the paragraph more concise.\n*   **Clarity of Movement:** The caption describes the change as a \"transition.\" While correct, this is a general term. The video shows a continuous camera movement (a slow zoom-in). Using a more specific verb like \"zooms in\" or stating that the \"shot tightens\" would more precisely describe the spatial dynamic.\n\n**Overall:**\nThis is a very strong caption that accurately and comprehensively describes the spatial framing of the video. The suggested refinements are minor and aimed at enhancing conciseness and the clarity of the camera movement.",

As the video progresses, the camera slowly zooms in, tightening the shot to a close-up that focuses on her face and upper shoulders. Throughout this movement, she remains centered, and the camera maintains its eye-level height, causing the background elements to become less prominent due to the tighter framing.",
