    "pre_caption": "In a high-angle wide shot, a warrior character is initially positioned in the center middle ground on a circular platform, with a large red orb in the bottom left foreground and a yellow orb in the bottom right foreground. The warrior moves from the center toward the right side of the platform as a spidery demon enters from the right edge of the frame. The demon moves to the center-right to engage the warrior in combat within the middle ground. Throughout the scene, game interface elements remain fixed, with a minimap and objectives list in the top right, a chat box in the bottom left, and health/resource orbs and an action bar along the bottom. During combat, a health bar for the demon appears at the top center of the screen.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Two humanoid warrior characters are depicted wearing full suits of ornate, bulky armor in shades of silver and gold, each equipped with shields. One warrior wields a longsword that emits a bright red glow, while the other carries a sword with a yellow hue. Accompanying them is a flame-like humanoid figure running alongside. They confront a demonic creature, identified as a \"Terror Demon,\" which has a spidery, insectoid lower body with multiple sharp, dark red legs. The demon's upper torso is more humanoid but skeletal, with glowing green highlights on its limbs and sharp claws. The creature's overall coloration is a mix of dark red and black.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a third-person 3D game video where the entire character is visible on screen, the setting is a dark, cavernous tower level. The environment is illuminated by a fiery red and orange glow from large, thick pillars and intricate, luminous patterns etched into the dark stone floor. Two large, pulsating red objects are present: one in the left-bottom foreground and the other in the right-top background. Two humanoid warrior characters are running towards the bottom right of the frame on a circular platform before a red, spider-like demon appears and engages in combat. The scene includes several game interface overlays: a minimap and an objectives list in the top right corner indicate the location is \"Besieged Tower Level 1\" and the task is to \"Kill Cimeries.\" The top left corner displays character information, while the bottom of the screen shows a health orb, a resource orb, and an action bar. A chat box is present in the bottom left corner. During combat, a health bar labeled \"TERROR DEMON\" appears above the enemy.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly states, \"As the camera moves toward the bottom right of the frame.\" The camera maintains a consistent high-angle follow-shot on the character and does not move independently; it is the character who moves slightly. This part should be rephrased to describe the character's movement. Additionally, the description of \"the health/resource orbs roll\" is factually inaccurate; the orbs are static spheres whose contents deplete or replenish, but they do not physically roll. This detail should be removed or corrected. Finally, the initial positioning is described as \"center,\" but it is more accurately center-right.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a high-angle shot from the video game Diablo 3, a warrior character is initially positioned on a circular, rune-etched platform in a dark, hellish tower. As the warrior moves slightly to the right, a red, spidery 'Terror Demon' emerges from the right edge of the frame to engage in combat. During the fight, a health bar for the demon appears at the top center of the screen. Throughout the scene, the game's interface remains visible, with static health and resource orbs in the bottom corners, an action bar along the bottom, and a minimap with objectives in the top right corner.",
