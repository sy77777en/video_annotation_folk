    "pre_caption": "A medium shot frames a lioness positioned in the center-right of the frame and in the middle ground. Tall grass occupies the foreground and middle ground, surrounding the lower portion of her body. In the background to the left, out-of-focus branches are visible. The lioness, initially with her head slightly lowered and eyes closed, lifts her head and opens her eyes to look directly forward. The camera remains static and is positioned at the lioness's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A lioness with tawny-brown fur is lying down in tall, green and dry grass. She has lighter, whitish fur around her muzzle and below her amber-colored eyes. Her rounded ears are visible and alert. Initially, her eyes are closed, but she then opens them and looks directly at the camera.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A lioness with tawny fur rests in an outdoor setting amidst tall, grassy vegetation. The environment is characterized by a mix of green and dry, yellowish grass, with thin, bare branches visible in the soft-focus background. The scene is bathed in warm, natural light. The lioness is initially seen with her eyes closed before opening them to look forward.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
