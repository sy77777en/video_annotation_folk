    "pre_caption": "A full shot captures a white, unmarked airplane positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. The aircraft is situated on a dark gray taxiway that curves from the bottom of the frame into the middle ground. In the background, a flat field and several blocky buildings are visible. The camera maintains a static, high-angle position above the airplane throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A white, unmarked commercial passenger airplane is positioned on a dark gray airport taxiway marked with yellow lines. The aircraft is a twin-engine jet, with one engine mounted under each wing, and features upward-curving winglets at its wingtips. The entire fuselage, wings, and tail are a uniform white color, devoid of any airline logos, text, or other distinguishing markings.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A white, unmarked passenger airplane is stationary on a curved section of an airport taxiway at either dawn or dusk. The dark asphalt is marked with a yellow centerline that follows the curve. In the background, a flat, green field separates the taxiway from several simple, blocky buildings in the distance. The entire scene is cast in a dim light under a hazy, reddish-brown sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is largely accurate and well-structured. However, for improved conciseness, the phrase \"that curves from the bottom of the frame towards the right side of the screen\" could be simplified. A more concise alternative would be \"that curves from the foreground toward the right,\" as \"bottom of the frame\" is synonymous with the foreground in this shot. The rest of the description, including the shot size, subject positioning, and camera movement, is accurate.",
