    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot capturing the bustling activity within a restaurant. The main subject, a person on a green hoverboard, enters from the right side of the frame and moves towards the center. Positioned initially in the right foreground, they transition to the center foreground as they glide forward. The camera remains at the subject's level, maintaining a consistent perspective. In the background, diners occupy various tables, with some individuals, such as a man in a striped shirt and a woman with blonde hair, situated in the middle ground on the left side of the frame. These patrons are seated and engaged in dining activities. A small, turquoise robotic vacuum is also visible, moving along the floor in the lower part of the frame, primarily in the foreground. The tables, covered with white tablecloths, and red-cushioned chairs are distributed throughout the middle ground, contributing to the restaurant's layout. The camera does not exhibit noticeable changes in height or angle, keeping the focus steady on the central action and surrounding environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures a bustling restaurant setting with several people seated at tables. A person on a green hoverboard moves from the right side of the frame to the center, wearing black pants and a dark shirt. This individual appears to be a server but is not interacting with any tables. Among the patrons, a man in a striped shirt and jeans and a woman with long blonde hair in a pure muted beige top are visible, engaged in conversation and dining. A small, round, turquoise robotic vacuum is seen moving between the tables, adding to the lively dining environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an indoor restaurant setting with a warm, inviting atmosphere. The environment features several round tables covered with white tablecloths, surrounded by red-cushioned chairs. The carpet has a geometric pattern in shades of brown and red, adding to the cozy ambiance. Diners are seated at the tables, engaged in conversation, creating a lively yet relaxed scene. A notable visual element is a small, turquoise robotic device moving across the floor, contrasting with the earthy tones of the carpet. Additionally, a person is seen moving from the right side of the frame to the center on a green hoverboard, adding dynamic movement and a modern, playful touch to the traditional dining setting. The lighting is soft and ambient, typical of an evening dining experience, enhancing the overall warmth of the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "This is excellent feedback. Here is a detailed analysis of the caption based on the criteria provided:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **Strengths:** The caption is largely accurate. It correctly identifies the shot as a medium shot, the main subject as a person on a hoverboard, and their movement from right to center in the foreground. The description of the diners, tables, and chairs in the middle ground is also correct.\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   The description of the main subject's entrance is slightly inaccurate. The person does not \"enter from the right side\"; their legs are already visible on the right at the start. A more precise description would be that they mount the hoverboard and then glide forward.\n    *   The caption states the robotic vacuum is \"moving,\" which is not clearly evident in the short clip; it appears mostly stationary. This statement borders on speculation, which the instructions advise against.\n    *   The vacuum is described as being \"primarily in the foreground,\" but it is positioned in the middle ground, behind the path of the hoverboard user.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   **Strengths:** The caption is very thorough, identifying the main subject, secondary subjects (diners), and key objects (vacuum, tables, chairs). It successfully describes their positions in both 2D (left/right/center) and 3D (foreground/middle ground) terms.\n*   **Areas for Improvement:** The caption omits a significant element: the large, gray metal cart that occupies the left foreground throughout the shot. This cart is a key framing element that helps establish the scene's depth, and its inclusion would make the description more complete.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths:** The caption adheres well to the core instructions. It is a single paragraph, uses natural English, and focuses primarily on spatial framing (shot size, position, depth, height, and movement). It correctly identifies the camera as being static and at the subject's level.\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   The instruction to \"Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain\" is slightly violated by the claim that the vacuum is \"moving.\"\n    *   While generally concise, phrases like \"capturing the bustling activity\" and \"contributing to the restaurant's layout\" are slightly interpretive rather than purely descriptive of spatial relationships. The caption could be made more direct by focusing strictly on the placement and movement of objects.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is very good and follows the instructions closely. It successfully captures the essential spatial dynamics of the scene. The feedback points are minor and focus on refining accuracy and completeness to achieve a more precise and objective description. By correcting the description of the subject's initial action, the vacuum's movement and position, and including the foreground cart, the caption would be nearly perfect.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A medium shot is set at a low angle on the floor of a restaurant. In the left foreground, a gray metal cart is partially visible. On the right, a person's lower body is seen as they step onto a green hoverboard and glide forward, moving from the right foreground to the center foreground. The camera remains static. In the middle ground, diners sit at tables with white tablecloths and red-cushioned chairs. A turquoise robotic vacuum is stationary on the patterned red carpet in the middle ground, to the right of the hoverboard's path. Among the diners are a man in a striped shirt on the left and a woman with blonde hair seated further back.",
