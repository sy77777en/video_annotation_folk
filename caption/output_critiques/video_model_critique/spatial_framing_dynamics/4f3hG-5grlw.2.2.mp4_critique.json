    "pre_caption": "This medium close-up shot centers on a figure in a suit with a bagged head wrapped in chains, positioned in the middle ground. To the left in the background, a rectangular poster is visible on the wall. Further back and slightly to the right of the poster, a circular clock is mounted on the wall. An ornate metal headboard occupies the right background, partially behind the figure. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A figure, likely a man, stands in a dimly lit room. His head is entirely covered by a crumpled, light brown bag, which has several rough holes torn into it, particularly around where eyes would be. Metal chains are wrapped around the bag, crisscrossing over the front. He is wearing a black suit jacket over a white collared shirt and a black necktie, which is slightly loosened and askew. The suit jacket is damaged, with a large hole on the arm.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors, in what appears to be a bedroom, characterized by dim lighting. In the background, an ornate, dark metal headboard of a bed is visible. On the wall to the left, a rectangular poster with some text and imagery can be seen, and further back, a circular clock is mounted on the wall. The overall color palette of the room is muted.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

The sentence \"Above the headboard and to the right of the clock, there is a black-and-white poster on the wall\" is incorrect. The object in question is a white, square-shaped item, not a black-and-white poster. To correct this, the description should be changed to \"a white, square object is on the wall\" to accurately reflect what is visible in the video and adhere to the instruction to avoid uncertain descriptions.",
