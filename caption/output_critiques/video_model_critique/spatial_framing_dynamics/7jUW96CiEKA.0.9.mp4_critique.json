    "pre_caption": "This is a wide shot where a white egret is positioned slightly right of center in the frame, standing in the shallow water in the middle ground. The water occupies the bottom half of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground, reflecting the egret and the bank. An eroded bank runs horizontally across the middle of the frame, situated in the middle ground behind the egret. Tall grasses cover the top portion of the frame along the bank in the background. The egret remains relatively still, wading slightly near the bank. The camera is positioned at the egret's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a white egret with a long neck and slender body, standing near the edge of a water body. Its plumage is smooth and bright, and it has a distinct yellow beak. The egret is positioned close to the water, with its legs partially submerged, suggesting it is either wading or preparing to move. The setting includes grassy vegetation along the bank, providing a natural habitat for the bird. The egret's posture is attentive, with its head slightly tilted, indicating alertness or focus on its surroundings.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor daytime scene along the bank of a calm body of water. An eroded bank, composed of dark soil, rises steeply from the water's edge and is topped with tall, dry, greenish-brown grasses. A large white bird with a long neck, slender legs, and a yellow beak stands in the shallow water close to the muddy bank. The still water reflects the bird and the overhanging bank.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is excellent and adheres to all instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:** The description is highly accurate. The egret is indeed slightly right of center in the middle ground. The breakdown of the scene into the water (foreground/middle ground), the bank (middle ground), and the grasses (background) is correct. The description of the egret's minimal movement is also accurate.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is very complete. It successfully identifies the shot size, the 2D and 3D positions of all key elements (egret, water, bank, grass), the camera's relative height, and the subtle movement within the shot. It provides a comprehensive spatial analysis of the scene.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows all instructions perfectly. It is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, objective language. It avoids speculation and emotional terms, focusing strictly on the spatial framing and dynamics as requested. It correctly identifies and describes all the required elements.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a wide, eye-level shot, a white egret stands in shallow water slightly right of center in the middle ground. The water fills the bottom half of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground and reflecting the bird and the eroded bank behind it. This dark, earthen bank runs horizontally across the middle of the frame, topped by tall grasses that occupy the background at the top of the frame. The egret remains relatively still, wading slowly near the bank.",
