    "pre_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot focusing on a person holding a book titled \"Virgil's Chronicle.\" The subject occupies the central area of the frame, with their upper body visible from the waist up. The person is positioned in the foreground, while the yellow car is situated in the background, slightly to the right. The car remains static throughout the video. The person is walking, and their movement is subtle, maintaining their central position in the frame. The camera stays at the subject's height, capturing the action without noticeable shifts in angle or perspective. The background includes a residential setting with a gray house and greenery, which remains consistent and unchanging. The spatial dynamics emphasize the subject and the book they hold, with minimal changes in their positioning relative to the camera.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a person with light skin, wearing a short-sleeved white shirt and a dark striped tie, holding a book titled \"Virgil's Chronicle\" with a maroon cover and gold lettering. The person is walking, holding the book close to their chest. In the background, a yellow car is visible, providing context to the setting. The focus is primarily on the person and the book, highlighting their attire and the book's distinct appearance.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an outdoor suburban setting during the daytime, characterized by clear skies and bright sunlight. The scene features a residential neighborhood with neatly trimmed hedges and a parked vintage yellow car on a driveway. A person is present, holding a maroon book titled \"Virgil's Chronicle\" with gold lettering, wearing a white short-sleeved shirt and a striped tie. The environment is calm and orderly, with a gray house and some trees in the background, conveying a sense of quiet suburban life. The overall atmosphere is serene, with the sunlight casting soft shadows on the ground.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on the caption. It is well-structured, detailed, and adheres to most of the instructions. Here is a breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is mostly accurate in its description of the shot size, subject positioning, and camera height.\n*   There is one significant inaccuracy: The statement that the background \"remains consistent and unchanging\" is incorrect. Because the camera is tracking the walking subject, the background elements (the house, car, and greenery) are actively moving from right to left across the frame. The caption correctly notes the subject maintains their central position, but it fails to describe the corresponding movement of the background, which is a key part of the shot's spatial dynamics.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is very complete. It successfully identifies and describes the shot size, the 2D and 3D positions of the person, the car, and the background, and the camera's height relative to the subject. It also attempts to describe the movement within the scene.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   The caption follows the instructions well by providing a single, coherent paragraph in simple English, avoiding speculation and subjective language.\n*   It correctly analyzes the spatial framing and positioning of the elements.\n*   The primary deviation from the instructions is the inaccurate description of the background's movement, which is a crucial aspect of the \"spatial dynamics\" the prompt asks for.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe caption is good but could be improved by accurately describing the movement of all elements in the frame. A more precise description would note that as the camera tracks the centrally-framed subject, the background scrolls past.\n\n**Example of a more accurate sentence:**\n\"As the person walks, the camera tracks them, keeping them centered in the frame while the background elements, including the house and car, move from right to left.\"",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video presents a close-up shot focusing on a person holding a book titled \"Virgil's Chronicle.\" The subject occupies the central area of the frame, with their upper body visible from the waist up. As the person walks, the camera tracks their movement, keeping them centered. Consequently, the background elements—a residential setting with a gray house, greenery, and a yellow car—scroll from right to left across the frame. The camera stays at the subject's height, capturing the action without noticeable shifts in angle or perspective. The spatial dynamics emphasize the subject and the book they hold, with their position relative to the camera remaining constant while the environment moves past them.",
