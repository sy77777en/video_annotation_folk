    "pre_caption": "The video captures a scene inside a diner from a first-person perspective, with the camera positioned above the subjects. Two women are seated at a booth with red cushioned seats and a wooden table. The woman on the left, wearing a green beret and a patterned brown top, is initially seen holding a camera and smiling. She is positioned in the middle-left of the frame, in the foreground. The woman on the right, wearing a red beret, a dark jacket, and a red scarf, is situated in the middle-right of the frame, also in the foreground. The table between them is cluttered with various items such as a drink cup, condiment bottles, and a basket with food, occupying the center of the frame. As the video progresses, the woman on the left moves her hand closer to the camera, partially obscuring the view. The background shows other diners and tables, contributing to the lively ambiance of the diner. The camera remains stationary throughout, maintaining a consistent overhead angle relative to the subjects.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two women seated at a diner booth with red cushioned seats and a wooden table. The woman on the left has light skin, wears a green beret, glasses, and a patterned brown top, and is holding a camera while smiling. The woman on the right has light skin, wears a red beret, a dark jacket, and a red scarf, and is looking towards the camera. The table is cluttered with items including a drink cup, condiment bottles, and a basket with food. The setting suggests a casual dining environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot inside a retro-style diner. The setting features red vinyl booth seating and wooden tables, creating a classic American diner atmosphere. The lighting is warm and slightly dim, suggesting an evening or nighttime setting. The tables are adorned with typical diner items like condiment bottles and paper napkins. The environment is lively, with patrons engaged in conversation, adding to the bustling ambiance. The scene captures the essence of a cozy, nostalgic diner experience.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good because it contains significant inaccuracies about the scene's action and spatial depth, and it violates a key instruction.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **Major Inaccuracy:** The caption incorrectly states that \"the woman on the left moves her hand closer to the camera, partially obscuring the view.\" The hand that enters the frame comes from the bottom and clearly belongs to the person holding the camera (the first-person perspective), not the woman in the booth. This is a fundamental misinterpretation of the action.\n*   **Inaccurate Depth:** The caption places both main women in the \"foreground.\" This is incorrect. The hand that enters from the bottom is in the foreground. The two women and their table are in the middle ground, and the third diner is in the background. This is a key error in describing the 3D spatial arrangement.\n*   **Omission:** The caption mentions only two women, completely omitting the third woman sitting in a booth in the background on the top-left.\n*   **Minor Inaccuracy:** It describes the camera as \"stationary,\" which is not entirely true. The camera is handheld and has the slight, natural movements of a person holding it, even if its general position is stable.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption fails to describe the most prominent movement in the video, which is the first-person hand entering the frame from the bottom and making a gesture. By misattributing this action, it misses a crucial element of the scene's dynamics.\n*   It successfully identifies the setting and the main subjects' attire but fails to account for all subjects present.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":** The phrase \"contributing to the lively ambiance of the diner\" is subjective and should have been avoided.\n*   **Failure to Accurately Describe Spatial Framing:** While it attempts to use terms like \"foreground\" and \"middle-left,\" its application is incorrect, failing the core instruction to accurately describe spatial framing and dynamics.\n*   **Partial Adherence:** The caption does follow the one-paragraph format, avoids speculation, and correctly identifies the first-person perspective and high camera angle. However, the factual errors and rule violations outweigh this.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a high-angle, first-person perspective, the video shows a scene inside a diner with red booths. In the middle ground, two women are seated across from each other in a booth. The woman on the left, wearing a green beret and a patterned top, holds a small camera and smiles. The woman on the right, wearing a red beret and sunglasses, looks up toward the camera. On the table between them are drinks, condiment bottles, and baskets of food. In the background, a third woman is visible sitting in a separate booth to the top-left. A hand, belonging to the person from whose perspective the video is shot, enters the frame from the bottom foreground and makes a gesture toward the women in the booth.",
