    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a woman standing on a skateboard on the ledge of a tall building. Initially, the camera is positioned at her level, capturing her from the side as she stands centered in the frame, with the building's windows forming the backdrop. The windows reflect the cityscape, situating the scene in the foreground while the urban landscape occupies the background. As the video progresses, the camera shifts to a lower angle, now positioned below the subject. This change in perspective emphasizes her elevated position on the ledge. Throughout the video, the woman remains in the center of the frame, maintaining a steady stance on the skateboard. The camera movement from her level to below her enhances the sense of height and scale, underscoring her position against the expansive cityscape reflected in the windows behind her.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a woman standing on a skateboard, positioned on the ledge of a tall building. She is wearing a white tank top, light-colored pants, and a knitted cap, highlighting her focus on safety and style. Notably, she has a prosthetic right leg. She is balanced on the skateboard, which is oriented parallel to the building's windows. The setting is urban, with a cityscape visible in the reflection of the windows, indicating a high altitude. The woman maintains a steady stance, facing forward, with a confident posture.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a drone POV, showcases a futuristic urban landscape during daylight. The setting is outdoors, featuring a cityscape with modern skyscrapers and reflective glass facades. The entire cityscape is beautifully mirrored in the glass facades. The architecture is sleek and contemporary, with tall buildings dominating the skyline. The weather is partly cloudy. **\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to below the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on your instructions, here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is inaccurate in its description of camera movement and angle. It states, \"Initially, the camera is positioned at her level\" and then \"shifts to a lower angle.\" In the video, the camera maintains a consistent low angle, positioned below the subject, throughout the entire clip. There is no discernible shift from one level to another.\n*   The description of the woman being captured \"from the side\" is not entirely precise. The angle is more of a front-three-quarters view.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully identifies the main subject (woman on a skateboard), the setting (building ledge), the shot size (wide shot), and the use of reflections to establish depth (cityscape in the background).\n*   It misses a minor detail: the woman's own faint reflection is visible in the window directly beside her. It also doesn't mention her subtle movements as she balances on the skateboard.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain\":** The core of the caption's analysis is built around a camera movement that does not occur. This is a significant deviation from the instructions.\n*   **Description of Spatial Dynamics:** By inventing a camera movement, the caption fails to accurately describe the spatial dynamics. The dynamic is one of stasis from a fixed low angle, not a transition between angles.\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The paragraph is well-structured, but the inaccurate information makes it misleading and unnecessarily long, as it spends several sentences analyzing a non-existent event.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is not good because it fundamentally misinterprets the camera work in the video. It fabricates a camera movement and bases its analysis on this incorrect observation, which directly violates the core instruction to describe only what is visible. A good caption would describe the static low angle of the shot and how that fixed perspective frames the subject against the reflected cityscape.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A wide, low-angle shot shows a woman balancing on a skateboard on the ledge of a modern, window-paneled building. The camera remains static throughout the clip, consistently looking up at her from a front-three-quarters view. The large windows behind her act as mirrors, reflecting a vast cityscape and a cloudy sky, which establishes her immense height. The woman, dressed in white, makes subtle movements to keep her balance. A faint reflection of her is visible in the window pane next to her. The fixed low-angle perspective keeps her centered in the frame, emphasizing her precarious position against the expansive, reflected urban backdrop.",
