    "pre_caption": "The video presents a full shot of a person dressed in a white outfit with orange stripes, including a helmet, gloves, and shoes. The individual is positioned centrally within the frame, walking from the left towards the right. This movement occurs in the foreground, while the background remains static, featuring a large black backdrop with a silver control panel on the left side. The control panel is situated in the middle ground, slightly to the left, and includes switches and a knob. Above the scene, a white line structure spans horizontally across the top, adding depth to the background. The camera maintains a steady position at the subject's level throughout the sequence, capturing the person's full body as they move across the frame. There are no changes in shot size or camera angle, keeping the subject consistently centered and the background elements fixed in their positions.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a person dressed in a white outfit with orange stripes, including a hood with a mask, gloves, and shoes. The individual is walking to the right and then to the left. The attire suggests a uniform or costume, possibly for a specific role or activity. The person has a light skin tone and is positioned mostly centrally within the frame.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents an indoor setting with a minimalist, futuristic design. The environment features a large, black backdrop with a prominent white structure resembling a control panel situated on the left side of the scene, complete with switches and a knob. A white line structure is present in the upper part of the image, adding to the visual interest. The setting is well-lit, emphasizing the contrast between the black and white elements. A person dressed in a white outfit with orange stripes and a hood with a mask walks across the scene, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise static environment. The overall atmosphere is sleek and modern, with a focus on geometric shapes and a monochromatic color scheme.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is a full shot of a person in a white outfit with orange stripes, a helmet, gloves, and shoes. The person is centered in the foreground, walking from left to right. In the static background, a silver control panel with switches and a knob is positioned in the middle ground on the left, against a black backdrop, while a white horizontal structure spans the top of the frame. The camera is steady and positioned at the subject's level, maintaining the full shot without any panning, tilting, or zooming, thus keeping the subject centered throughout their movement.",
