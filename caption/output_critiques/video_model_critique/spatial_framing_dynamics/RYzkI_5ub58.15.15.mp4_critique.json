    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a natural setting with birds scattered across leafless tree branches and the ground. The birds are positioned throughout the frame, with some in the foreground on the lower branches and ground, while others are in the middle ground on higher branches. The scene is framed with the dense forest in the background, providing depth. The camera is at the same height as the subjects, capturing the birds at eye level. The birds' positions vary, with some perched on branches in the top left and top right, while others are on the ground in the bottom left and bottom right. One bird in the center flaps its wings, creating slight movement within the otherwise static scene. The overall composition highlights the interaction between the birds and their environment, with the camera maintaining a consistent level throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a group of birds perched on and around leafless tree branches. The birds are predominantly white with some darker markings, and they vary in size. They are scattered across the branches, with some standing on the ground below. The scene is set in a natural environment with a dense forest in the background. The birds appear to be at rest, with one bird standing on a tree branch, flapping its wings.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor scene in a lush, green forest setting during daylight. The environment is filled with tall trees, some with bare branches, and dense foliage in various shades of green. In the foreground, the trees are rather bare, with no leaves. Birds are perched on these branches or on the ground. One bird is standing on a tree, flapping its wings, and some display white and gray plumage. The ground is covered with a mix of grass and underbrush. The natural light casts soft shadows, highlighting the textures of the tree bark and leaves. The scene is tranquil, with a focus on the interaction between the birds and their natural habitat.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption inaccurately describes the primary movement in the video. It states that a bird is \"flapping its wings,\" but the video clearly shows a white bird in the center-left taking flight and landing on a different branch. This key spatial dynamic should be corrected to accurately reflect the bird's movement from one position to another. Additionally, the statement that the \"camera is at the same height as the subjects\" is an oversimplification, as the birds are at various heights; it would be more precise to state the camera is at an eye-level perspective into the scene. Finally, the phrase \"highlights the interaction between the birds and their environment\" is interpretive and should be removed to adhere to the instruction of avoiding subjective analysis.",
