    "pre_caption": "This close-up shot centers on the back of a man's head and shoulders, which occupy the lower portion of the frame in the foreground. He remains completely still, facing away from the camera towards a vast, blurry, arid landscape that stretches across the middle ground and background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level and maintains a fixed, static position throughout the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with short, dark brown hair is seen from the back, facing away from the viewer. He is wearing a black t-shirt and appears to be sitting or kneeling while looking out at a distant, blurry landscape. His ears and the back of his neck are visible, and his posture remains still throughout the video.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a perspective positioned behind a man with short, dark hair, the scene looks out over a vast, arid landscape under a hazy sky. The man, wearing a black t-shirt, is seated and still, facing a wide, dusty plain that stretches towards a soft-focus background of brown, rolling hills. The entire environment is bathed in a warm, muted light, casting the man's back into shadow while illuminating the barren terrain before him.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

The video does not show the camera arcing counterclockwise; instead, it performs a very slow dolly-in, causing the man's head and shoulders to gradually grow larger within the frame. The phrase \"slowly arcs counterclockwise around the man\" should be replaced with a description of this slow push-in, such as \"the camera slowly pushes in on the man.\" Additionally, the caption should specify the camera's height, noting that it is positioned behind the man at approximately his head level.",
