    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide shot of a landscape. The bottom third of the frame is occupied by a flat, grassy prairie that extends from the foreground to the background horizon. The upper two-thirds of the frame are dominated by a massive, turbulent storm cloud system in the middle ground and background. The dark, layered base of the storm cloud sits in the middle of the frame, with lighter, swirling clouds above it. A curtain of rain is visible in the background, primarily in the center and right portions of the scene. On the far left horizon, a small patch of sunlight breaks through in the background. In this time-lapse, the entire cloud formation swirls and moves across the sky, with the lower, darker sections showing the most prominent motion. The camera is positioned at a low angle, looking up at the sky.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a dramatic landscape scenery shot capturing a massive, turbulent storm system moving across a vast, flat prairie. The sky is dominated by a swirling, layered supercell cloud, with dark, ominous gray and teal tones contrasting with brighter white sections above. Sheets of rain are visible falling in the distance, partially obscuring a sliver of golden light on the far horizon. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the immense scale and powerful atmosphere of the weather phenomenon itself, dwarfing the expansive, grassy landscape below.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A time-lapse captures a massive, turbulent storm system moving across a vast, flat grassland. The sky is filled with dramatic, swirling clouds in shades of dark gray, teal, and deep blue, forming a menacing, layered structure. A grey curtain of rain is visible falling in the distance. Below, the green and yellow prairie stretches to the horizon, where a patch of bright, golden sunlight breaks through a gap in the clouds, creating a stark contrast with the dark, ominous weather.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
