    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot filmed from a high angle, a police van is positioned in the left-middle ground on a bridge that extends horizontally across the frame. A person in white stands on a hoverboard next to the van, while a figure in tactical gear stands to their right in the center-middle ground. A second figure in tactical gear runs from the left side of the frame toward the center, stopping near the front of the van. The person in white then leaps upward and toward the right, moving from the left side of the frame toward the center. Simultaneously, the two figures in tactical gear jump toward the airborne person, converging mid-air. All three subjects then fall together toward the right side of the frame, landing near the bridge's railing. In the background, a river and a futuristic cityscape are visible, while a railing occupies the immediate foreground at the bottom of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In the video, a large police van, predominantly black with blue and yellow markings and red/yellow chevrons on the rear, is parked on a bridge over water. A light-skinned person wearing a white hood, dressed in a white top and white pants, is standing at the van's door, balancing on a hovering skateboard. A person wearing a dark grey/black jetpack, including a helmet that obscures their face, blocks the white-clad person’s way. Another person in identical tactical gear runs to the front of the van holding a weapon. Finally, as the person in white takes off into the air, the other two leap toward him. The two collide midair, and all three tumble down to the edge of the bridge.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures an outdoor scene on a bridge crossing a wide river in a futuristic city during daylight hours. A large, multi-wheeled police vehicle, predominantly dark with blue and yellow checkered markings and yellow chevrons on the rear, is stopped on the paved bridge roadway. The bridge has a dark, ornate metal railing with repeating quatrefoil cutouts. Across the river, the background features a mix of contemporary and futuristic architecture, including tall buildings with unconventional shapes and construction cranes. A partially submerged, overturned vessel rests in the water near the opposite bank. Sunlight creates distinct shadows on the bridge surface. Figures are visible near the police vehicle, with one individual standing in front of the police car door. Two other figures are positioned nearby—one directly in front of the first figure and the other to their right. In the end, everyone moves toward the edge of the bridge.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains two factual inaccuracies regarding the subjects' movements. First, the person in white does not leap \"upward, jumping vertically in place\"; they jump off the hoverboard and toward the right, away from the van. Second, the three subjects do not \"land near the bridge's railing\"; they fall together over the railing and out of the frame toward the water below. Additionally, the description of the second tactical figure stopping \"near the front of the van\" is slightly imprecise; the figure stops in the center of the frame, near the other two individuals.",
