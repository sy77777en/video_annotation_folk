    "pre_caption": "The video features a close-up shot of a woman and a man standing outdoors at night. The woman, with short, dark curly hair and wearing a dark outfit with a colorful scarf, is frequently turning her head to look around or engage in conversation with the man. The man, also with short, curly dark hair, is dressed in a dark jacket over a light-colored shirt. He occasionally turns his head during the interaction, not consistently looking at the woman. Both subjects are positioned close to each other, suggesting a dynamic conversation or interaction.\n\nThe background consists of dark foliage, creating a serene and calm atmosphere. The scene is dimly lit, with a soft light source highlighting the subjects' faces against the shadowy surroundings. This lighting technique adds depth to the scene, drawing the viewer's attention to the subjects' expressions. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the video, maintaining a consistent perspective that emphasizes their facial expressions and interactions.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a woman and a man. The woman has short, dark curly hair and is wearing a dark outfit with a colorful scarf. She frequently turns her head to look around or engage in conversation with the man. The man has short, curly dark hair and is dressed in a dark jacket over a light-colored shirt. He occasionally turns his head during the interaction, not consistently looking at the woman. Both subjects are positioned close to each other, suggesting a dynamic conversation or interaction.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set outdoors at night, featuring a dimly lit environment with a backdrop of dark foliage. The scene captures two individuals close together, partially illuminated by a soft light source, which highlights their faces against the shadowy surroundings. The lighting creates a contrast between the subjects and the dark background, adding depth to the scene. The individuals are positioned in a way that suggests interaction, with their expressions visible due to the subtle lighting. The overall atmosphere is calm and quiet, with the natural elements of the night and the surrounding greenery providing a serene setting. Their lower bodies are not visible, focusing the viewer's attention on their faces and expressions.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
