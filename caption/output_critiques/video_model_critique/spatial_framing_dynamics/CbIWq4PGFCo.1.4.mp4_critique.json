    "pre_caption": "A close-up shot frames a man from the shoulders up, positioning him in the center-left of the foreground. He is shown from a side and back view, with his head turned toward the left side of the frame. In the out-of-focus background, a barren, sunlit landscape occupies the middle ground. The camera is positioned at the man's level, and the framing remains static throughout the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned young man with short, dark brown, and slightly messy hair is shown from a side and back view. He has some light stubble on his face and is wearing a dusty black shirt. His head is slightly turned towards the left, and he has a somber expression.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors in a barren, sunlit landscape. The ground consists of dry, light-brown earth, creating a dusty and uneven surface. In the blurred background, indistinct mounds of similar terrain are visible under warm, natural light.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly states that the camera performs a \"counterclockwise arc\" and that the man \"turns his head.\" In the video, the man's head remains stationary throughout the clip, consistently facing the left side of the frame. The camera is the element that moves, performing a subtle clockwise arc (or a pan to the right) around the man. This movement transitions the perspective from a three-quarter back view to a more direct back view. The description should be corrected to reflect that the camera moves around the static subject, not that the subject himself moves.",

He is seen from a three-quarter back view, his head turned toward the left side of the frame. The man remains stationary as the camera, positioned at his level, slowly pans to the right, arcing around him to show a more direct view of the back of his head. In the out-of-focus background, a barren, sunlit landscape is visible.",
