    "pre_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot focusing on a hand interacting with a control panel. Initially, the hand occupies the center of the frame, positioned in the foreground, while the control panel is directly beneath it, also in the foreground. The hand, located in the middle of the frame, moves slightly as it adjusts the dials. The control panel, featuring illuminated buttons and displays, is situated in the lower part of the frame. Midway through the video, the camera shifts focus to reveal a screen in the background, which is now centered in the frame. This screen, displaying technical data and graphics, is positioned further back in the middle ground. The transition from the hand and control panel to the screen occurs smoothly, maintaining the close-up shot size. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout, capturing the detailed interaction and subsequent display change without altering its height.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a close-up of a hand interacting with a control panel. The hand, with a light skin tone, is adjusting dials on a device that resembles a vintage radio or communication equipment. The hand is wearing a dark, ribbed sleeve, suggesting a sweater or jacket. The device has illuminated buttons and displays, with orange and red lights indicating active settings. After the midway point, a screen is revealed displaying technical data and graphics, possibly related to navigation or communication. The overall scene is dimly lit, with a focus on the interaction between the hand and the equipment, highlighting the technological and manual aspects of the setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting with a dimly lit, high-tech environment. The scene features a hand interacting with electronic equipment, including a radio and a screen displaying data. The equipment is characterized by dark metallic surfaces with illuminated buttons and dials, emitting a warm orange glow. The screen shows complex graphics and text, suggesting a technical or control room atmosphere. The lighting is low, creating a moody ambiance with shadows and focused highlights on the devices. The overall color scheme is a mix of dark tones with contrasting bright lights, enhancing the technological and slightly mysterious feel of the setting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is partially accurate but contains significant inaccuracies regarding the video's dynamics and spatial relationships.\n*   **Accurate:** The initial description of the close-up shot, the hand's position in the foreground, and its interaction with the control panel is correct. The statement that the camera remains at the subject's level is also accurate.\n*   **Inaccurate:** The description of the transition is incorrect. The caption states the camera \"shifts focus\" and the transition occurs \"smoothly.\" In reality, the camera performs a very fast pan/tilt (a whip pan) to the right, which is a jarring and rapid movement, not a smooth one. The primary action is a physical camera move, not just a focus pull.\n*   **Inaccurate:** The positioning of the screen is misidentified. The caption places it in the \"background\" and then \"middle ground.\" The screen is on an adjacent part of the console, remaining in the foreground and the focus of the close-up, not in the middle or background of the scene.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption attempts to cover all the required elements but misses key details that define the shot's character.\n*   It successfully identifies the shot size, the main subjects, their initial positions, and the camera height.\n*   It fails to capture the most significant dynamic element of the shot: the speed and nature of the camera movement (a whip pan). This omission leaves out a crucial piece of information about the shot's visual style.\n*   It correctly notes that the shot size remains a close-up but misses the opportunity to describe the motion blur and disorientation caused by the rapid camera movement.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption follows the structural and stylistic guidelines but fails in its core mission to provide a precise description of the spatial dynamics.\n*   It correctly uses a single-paragraph format, avoids emotional language, and refrains from speculation.\n*   It follows the requested order by starting with the shot size and then describing the position and movement of elements.\n*   However, by inaccurately describing the camera movement (\"smoothly\") and the depth of the final subject (\"background\"/\"middle ground\"), it does not fulfill the primary instruction of providing a clear and correct analysis of the spatial framing and dynamics.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is a good attempt but ultimately fails due to key inaccuracies in describing the camera's movement and the spatial depth of the elements. The description of a \"smooth\" transition is the most significant error, as the actual movement is rapid and abrupt. A more accurate caption would describe the initial framing and then specify the fast pan/tilt that shifts the view to another foreground element on the console.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a hand in the foreground, turning a dial on a control panel. The panel, also in the foreground, has an illuminated display. Midway through the video, the camera executes a rapid whip pan to the right, creating significant motion blur as it repositions. The camera's movement settles on an adjacent screen on the same console, which is also in the foreground. This screen, now centered in the frame, displays technical graphics. Throughout the entire sequence, the camera maintains its close-up framing and remains level with the console.",
