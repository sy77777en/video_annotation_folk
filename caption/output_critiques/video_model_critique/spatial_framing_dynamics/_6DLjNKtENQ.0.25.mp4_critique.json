    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a slightly blurry view of a building rooftop occupying the bottom and center foreground, while a small portion of the monster is in focus at the top of the frame in the middle ground, emerging from water located on the right. Adjacent to the water, two buildings with green octagonal roofs are positioned in the middle ground on the right. As the camera, positioned above the subject, moves forward, the full body of the monster is revealed. The monster transitions from the water on the right towards the center and left middle ground, creating a significant splash. Simultaneously, several small tanks become visible on a street in the top left and center middle ground, firing towards the monster, which is now more centrally positioned in the middle ground where an explosion occurs on its back. The initial foreground rooftop recedes towards the bottom of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video, filmed from a drone's perspective, shows a large, reptilian monster with a dark, scaly, and spiky back and a lighter-colored underbelly emerging from a body of water, creating a significant splash. Several small, tan-colored military tanks are positioned on a nearby street, firing red tracer rounds at the monster. An explosion is visible on the monster's back as it is hit.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures an aerial view of an urban environment during the daytime. The scene is set near a body of water, with several multi-story buildings visible, some featuring flat, dark grey rooftops and others with distinctive green, octagonal, tiered roofs. A paved road runs parallel to the water, with what appears to be a bridge or overpass structure. A large, dark, spiky creature with a long tail emerges from the water, creating a significant white foamy splash as it moves onto the land near the road. Small explosions, appearing as bursts of orange flame and dark smoke, occur on the creature's back as it advances. Several small, tan-colored vehicles are visible on the road. The weather is clear, with bright sunlight casting shadows.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video is filmed from a drone POV and shows a monster being attacked by tanks. It begins with a slightly blurry view of a rooftop and a small portion of the monster in focus at the top of the frame. As the drone moves forward, the full body of the monster is revealed, along with tanks nearby firing at it.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption's description of the video's opening is inaccurate. The video does not begin with a view of the monster; it begins with an explosion on a street in the top-left background, after which the monster appears. The description of the foreground rooftop as \"slightly blurry\" is also incorrect, as it is in focus. The initial sentence should be corrected to state that the shot opens with a foreground rooftop and a background explosion, and *then* the monster emerges from the water on the right, moving onto the street in the top-left and center middle ground. The remainder of the description accurately details the subsequent spatial dynamics and elements.",
