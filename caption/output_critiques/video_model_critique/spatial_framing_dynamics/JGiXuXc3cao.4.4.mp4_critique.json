    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot from a low angle, featuring a large, pod-shaped vehicle in the top left and a smaller, rectangular device in the middle ground to its right, connected by a thin tether against a dark, textured background. The smaller device descends toward the bottom of the frame as the larger vehicle moves up and out of the top left. The camera follows the descending device while pulling back, transitioning into an extreme wide shot. In the final view, the smaller device is suspended in the top center, with the camera now at its height, emitting two wide beams of light that illuminate the textured surface filling the bottom of the frame, where a small, dark object rests in the bottom left.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a large, streamlined, pod-shaped vehicle, white on its upper half and dark gray on its lower half, with a rounded nose. Connected to this vehicle by a thin, white tether is a smaller, gray, rectangular device that appears to be a sensor array. The smaller device is deployed from the larger vehicle and is shown being lowered into a dark space. It then emits two wide, conical beams of light downwards, illuminating and scanning a dark, textured surface below, where a small, dark, oblong object is visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, deep-water environment, a streamlined, white and grey submersible is tethered by a long, thin cable to a smaller, rectangular sensor array. The sensor descends into the dark abyss, where it emits wide, conical beams that scan the textured, grey ocean floor below, revealing a small, dark object resting on the seabed.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of two objects connected by a string. As the camera moves, one object is lowered while the other remains stationary, eventually moving out of the frame. The camera then pulls back, transitioning to an extreme wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: Two objects are connected by a string. The camera starts below both objects, following one as it descends, while the other moves out of frame. In the end, the camera focuses on the descending object with a camera height that seems to be at the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly states that the smaller, rectangular device is in the foreground; it is actually in the middle ground, positioned further from the camera than the larger pod-shaped vehicle, which occupies the foreground. Additionally, the description of the final camera position being \"at its height\" is inaccurate; the camera is positioned far below the suspended device, resulting in a low-angle shot of that object. Lastly, the opening shot is more accurately described as a medium shot rather than a full shot.",
