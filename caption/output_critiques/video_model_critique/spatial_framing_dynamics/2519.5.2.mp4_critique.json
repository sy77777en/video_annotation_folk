    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium close-up shot of a man, capturing him from the chest up. Positioned slightly to the right in the frame, he occupies the foreground, with his body angled slightly away from the camera. The man remains stationary throughout the sequence, maintaining a consistent position in the frame. The background is dark and indistinct, with minimal visible details, emphasizing the subject. A faint beam of light enters from the left side, casting subtle highlights on the man's face and upper body. The camera is at the subject's eye level, providing a direct view of his upper torso and face. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial position during the video. The overall composition keeps the focus tightly on the man, with the dimly lit surroundings contributing to a confined and intimate atmosphere.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man with light skin and short, dark hair. He is wearing a dark jacket over a patterned shirt with a light-colored collar. His facial expression appears sad, and he is looking slightly downward. The lighting is dim, casting shadows on his face, which emphasizes his contemplative demeanor. The man is positioned slightly to the right in the frame.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set indoors in a dimly lit room, creating a shadowy and subdued atmosphere. The lighting is minimal, with a faint beam of light cutting through the darkness, highlighting the contours of the scene. The walls and ceiling are dark, possibly wooden, adding to the enclosed and intimate feel of the space. The time of day is indeterminate due to the lack of natural light, suggesting an isolated environment. The overall color palette is muted, with deep shadows and soft highlights. The setting is simple, with no visible furniture or props, focusing on the ambient mood created by the interplay of light and shadow.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on this caption. It is accurate, detailed, and follows the instructions very well for the most part. Here is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Feedback\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description is highly accurate. The shot is indeed a medium close-up, the man is positioned slightly to the right in the foreground, the lighting comes from the left, and the camera is at eye level. All factual details are correctly identified.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is very complete. It successfully addresses all the required components:\n    *   **Shot Size:** Correctly identified as a \"medium close-up.\"\n    *   **Position (2D/3D):** Clearly describes the subject as \"slightly to the right in the frame\" (2D) and in the \"foreground\" (3D).\n    *   **Camera Height:** Correctly states the camera is at the \"subject's eye level.\"\n    *   **Movement/Changes:** Accurately notes that the subject is \"stationary\" and there are \"no noticeable changes.\"\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres to most instructions, using simple, natural English and focusing on spatial framing. However, there is one minor deviation:\n    *   The instruction states, \"**Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives**.\" The final phrase, \"...with the dimly lit surroundings contributing to a **confined and intimate atmosphere**,\" uses subjective terms to describe the mood. While the observation is astute, it falls outside the required objective description of spatial elements. A more compliant version would omit this interpretation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is excellent and almost perfectly follows all guidelines. The only point of improvement is to remove the subjective description of the \"atmosphere\" to fully comply with the instruction to avoid emotional or interpretive language. Otherwise, it is a model example of the desired output.",
