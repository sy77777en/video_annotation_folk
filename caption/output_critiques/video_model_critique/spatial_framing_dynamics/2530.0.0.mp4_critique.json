    "pre_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of a woman, capturing her from the shoulders up. Initially, the image is out of focus, but it quickly transitions to a clear view. The woman is centrally positioned in the frame, occupying the foreground, while the softly blurred background remains in the middle ground. Her face is directly facing the camera, with her head slightly turned towards the right side of the frame. The camera maintains a steady position at the subject's eye level throughout the sequence. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial position; the framing consistently emphasizes the woman's face against the indistinct backdrop. The lighting highlights her features, maintaining a consistent focus on her expression.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a woman with medium skin tone and dark hair pulled back, wearing a black top. Her expression is serious and focused. She is centrally positioned and facing forward, with a clear and direct gaze. The lighting enhances all of her facial features, providing a balanced emphasis on her eyes, lips, and overall visage.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video begins with an outdoor setting featuring a neutral, muted color palette. Initially, the shot is out of focus, gradually transitioning to a clear focus on a woman prominently positioned in the foreground. The softly blurred background suggests an open space, possibly near a body of water or an expansive landscape. The lighting indicates daytime, with a soft, diffused quality that suggests overcast or gentle sunlight. The scene is captured from an objective point of view, emphasizing the woman's presence through the sharp detail against the indistinct backdrop, creating a contrast between her clarity and the soft, ambient environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the shot as a close-up showing the woman from the shoulders up. The description of the focus change from blurry to clear is precise. The woman's central position in the foreground, her head's orientation, and the static, eye-level camera are all described correctly as seen in the video.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete and successfully addresses all the requirements of the instructions.\n*   **Shot Size:** Correctly identified as a \"close-up shot.\"\n*   **Spatial Position (2D & 3D):** It effectively describes the woman's position as \"centrally positioned\" (2D) and in the \"foreground\" (3D), and the background as being in the \"middle ground\" (3D).\n*   **Camera Height:** Accurately stated as being at the \"subject's eye level.\"\n*   **Spatial Dynamics/Changes:** It perfectly captures the primary dynamic element—the focus pull from blurry to sharp—and correctly notes the absence of any other changes in framing or position.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption adheres exceptionally well to the given guidelines.\n*   It is a single, concise, and coherent paragraph.\n*   It focuses strictly on spatial framing and dynamics, avoiding emotional or subjective adjectives (e.g., it doesn't describe her expression as \"determined\" or \"serious\").\n*   It uses simple, natural English.\n*   The statement \"The lighting highlights her features, maintaining a consistent focus on her expression\" is acceptable as it describes the technical effect of the lighting and framing rather than speculating on the subject's emotional state.\n*   It avoids any speculative language.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe caption is excellent. It is a model example of how to follow the instructions, providing a description that is accurate, detailed, and objective. It perfectly captures the visual and spatial information of the video clip in a clear and structured manner. No improvements are necessary.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video presents a static, eye-level close-up of a woman from the shoulders up. Centered in the foreground, she faces the camera with her head turned slightly to the right. The shot begins out of focus and then racks into a sharp focus on her face, while the background remains softly blurred. The framing is consistent throughout, with no changes in shot size or camera position, keeping the visual emphasis on the subject.",
