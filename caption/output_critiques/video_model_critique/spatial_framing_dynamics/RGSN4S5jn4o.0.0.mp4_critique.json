    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot captured at subject level, the scene opens with a checkered crosswalk occupying the foreground and middle ground. A man walks from the right middle ground towards the left, while a yellow taxi is visible in the right background. An animated logo appears in the top center and drops onto the crosswalk in the foreground, transforming its pattern into a white, maze-like design. As this happens, the camera pans left and moves forward. A woman enters from the left middle ground, walking towards the right, and transforms into a 2D animated character in the same position. Other pedestrians are visible in the center and right middle ground, walking towards the camera, while a user interface element for \"Brushes\" appears in the top right corner of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a city street scene with a checkered crosswalk. A yellow taxi is visible in the distance, driving along the road. On the right, a man with dark skin tone is walking, wearing a green jacket, blue jeans, and carrying a backpack. In the foreground, an animated logo drops onto the ground, transforming the checkered crosswalk into a maze-like pattern. A woman with pink hair transitions into a pink cartoon character through a mixed reality effect. Another figure starts as a person with dark skin tone, wearing a blue hoodie and dark yellow jacket, and transforms into a headless cartoon character with a pink jacket and blue pants. Further back, a man in a suit with a white shirt and red tie stands in front of a flower stand, which is filled with colorful flowers. The scene blends real and mixed reality elements, creating a dynamic visual contrast.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot of an urban street scene during the day. The setting is outdoors, featuring a city street lined with modern buildings of varying colors, including beige, red, and blue facades. The street is marked with a distinctive black-and-white checkered pattern at a crosswalk. A yellow taxi is moving forward along the road. Sidewalks are adorned with flower stands, and a few pedestrians are present, contributing to the urban atmosphere. During the video, an overlay element drops to the ground, causing the ground pattern to become maze-like. Notably, the video includes pedestrians transforming into colorful animated characters, adding a whimsical element. Overlay elements are present, including text and icons related to digital brushes, positioned in the upper right corner, indicating a creative or augmented reality aspect.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains a factual error regarding the identity of the second person who transforms into an animation. It states, \"The man in the yellow jacket is also transformed into a 2D animated headless figure.\" However, the video shows the person who transforms is a man wearing a tan jacket and a green cap, walking in the right middle ground. The man in the yellow jacket is a different pedestrian, seen initially on the left sidewalk and later near the flower stand, who does not transform. This misidentification is confusing, especially since the \"man in a yellow jacket\" is mentioned in the preceding sentence. To correct this, the final two sentences should be revised to accurately describe the events. For example: \"A woman enters from the left middle ground and transforms into a 2D animated character as she reaches the left foreground. Simultaneously, a man in a tan jacket in the right middle ground also transforms into a 2D animation, and a user interface element for 'Brushes' appears in the top right.\"",
