    "pre_caption": "In a medium close-up shot, a man is positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. Directly behind him, a chain-link fence spans the width of the frame, also in the middle ground. A building and trees are visible in the background through the fence. The camera is positioned at the man's level. He is initially stationary, but near the end of the clip, his upper body begins to bob slightly, indicating he is starting to walk forward toward the camera.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with light skin, short dark brown hair, and light stubble stands facing forward. He wears a light blue denim jacket open over a white t-shirt. He looks directly at the camera with a neutral expression and blinks. Towards the end of the scene, he appears to start moving, possibly walking towards the camera. In the background, an out-of-focus fence and building are visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene is set during the day, featuring a man in a denim jacket standing on a dark, paved surface. A tall, silver chain-link fence is positioned directly behind him, separating the foreground from the background. Through the diamond-patterned mesh of the fence, the out-of-focus shapes of a building and trees are visible.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Feedback on the caption:\n\nThe provided caption is excellent and provides a high-quality description of the video clip. It is accurate, complete, and adheres closely to all instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **Shot Size:** \"Medium close-up shot\" is an accurate description, as the man is framed from the chest up.\n*   **Spatial Positioning:** The description of the man in the \"center of the frame\" and \"middle ground\" is correct. The placement of the \"chain-link fence\" in the middle ground and the \"building and trees\" in the background is also accurate.\n*   **Camera Height:** \"The camera is positioned at the man's level\" is a correct assessment of the camera's height relative to the subject.\n*   **Movement:** The description of the man being \"initially stationary\" and then his \"upper body begins to bob slightly\" is a precise observation of the action in the clip. The phrase \"indicating he is starting to walk forward toward the camera\" is a reasonable and well-supported inference based on the visual cues.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully covers all the required elements: shot size, 2D and 3D position of the subject and key background elements, camera height, and the change in movement from static to dynamic.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   The caption focuses entirely on spatial framing and dynamics as requested.\n*   It uses simple, natural, and objective language, avoiding emotional or speculative terms.\n*   It is formatted correctly as a single, concise paragraph without any introductory text or markdown.\n\nOverall, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions, resulting in a clear, detailed, and accurate description of the video's visual composition and movement. No changes are necessary.",
