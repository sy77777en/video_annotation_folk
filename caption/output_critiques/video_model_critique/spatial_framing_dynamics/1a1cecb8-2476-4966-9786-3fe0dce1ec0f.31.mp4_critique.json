    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of an urban outdoor scene, capturing a broad view of the environment. The camera remains stationary throughout, offering a consistent perspective. In the foreground, the road occupies the lower portion of the frame, with pedestrian crossings marked clearly. Traffic signals and street signs are positioned near the center-left, slightly elevated in the middle ground. The tall evergreen trees and budding deciduous trees are distributed across the left and right sides of the frame, forming part of the middle ground. A stone wall runs horizontally along the middle ground, separating the road from the background. In the background, a brick building is visible towards the right side of the frame. The sky, overcast and diffused, spans the upper portion of the frame. The camera's height is approximately at eye level, providing a direct view of the scene without significant elevation or depression. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial positioning of elements within the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot. There is no main subject because the focus is on the environment and atmosphere, highlighting the urban setting, trees, and surrounding architecture rather than a specific object. The composition emphasizes the overall scene and context.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a first-person POV, depicts an outdoor urban setting during the day. The scene features an intersection with pedestrian crossings and a mix of natural and architectural elements. Tall evergreen trees and deciduous trees with budding leaves line the sidewalk, indicating a springtime environment. A stone wall borders the area, and a brick building is visible in the background. The sky is overcast, casting a diffused light over the scene. Traffic signals and street signs are present, adding to the urban atmosphere. The road is paved, with clear markings for pedestrian crossings.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "This is excellent feedback. Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is highly accurate in its description of the static elements. It correctly identifies the shot as a wide shot and accurately places the road, crosswalk, traffic signals, trees, wall, and building in their respective 2D (left, right, center) and 3D (foreground, middle ground, background) positions.\n*   The description of the sky as overcast and the camera height as approximately eye-level is also accurate.\n*   **The one significant inaccuracy** is the statement that \"The camera remains stationary throughout\" and \"There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial positioning of elements.\" The camera is, in fact, moving slowly forward. This is evident by how the white lines of the crosswalk in the foreground move down and begin to exit the bottom of the frame.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is very complete, addressing all the required components of the instructions: shot size, spatial position (2D and 3D), camera height, and changes (though the description of changes is incorrect).\n*   It successfully analyzes multiple elements within the scene, providing a comprehensive spatial overview.\n*   It correctly notes the traffic light's color changes from yellow to green, which is a subtle but important detail of the scene's dynamics.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Formatting:** The caption correctly adheres to the single-paragraph format without introductory text or markdown.\n*   **Language:** It uses simple, natural, and objective English, avoiding emotional, subjective, or speculative language as instructed.\n*   **Focus:** The description remains focused on spatial framing and dynamics.\n*   **Core Error:** The primary failure to adhere to the instructions is in accurately describing the \"changes\" and \"spatial movements.\" By missing the slow forward camera movement, it fails to describe a key dynamic of the shot.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is very good and demonstrates a strong understanding of how to describe a static scene spatially. However, its failure to detect and describe the subtle camera movement is a critical flaw. A perfect caption would replace the sentences about the camera being stationary with a description of the slow forward drift, noting how it affects the elements in the foreground.\n\n**Example of a more accurate sentence:**\n\"The camera moves slowly forward, causing the pedestrian crossing lines in the foreground to drift down and toward the bottom of the frame, while the elements in the middle and background remain relatively stable in their positions.\"",
