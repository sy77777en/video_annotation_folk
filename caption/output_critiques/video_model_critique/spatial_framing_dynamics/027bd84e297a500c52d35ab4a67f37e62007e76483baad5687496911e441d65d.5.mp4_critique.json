    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot of a cylindrical nesting doll, predominantly white with blue and green floral patterns, positioned in the foreground on the left side of the frame. As the video progresses, the nesting doll rolls from the left towards the right, moving out of the frame. This transition shifts the shot size to a wide view, revealing a smaller blue nesting doll in the foreground on the left side. The smaller nesting doll then rolls slowly across the frame from left to right, maintaining its position in the foreground. The background remains a plain white throughout, providing a consistent backdrop. The camera maintains a level position relative to the subjects, capturing their movements smoothly as they roll across the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins a cylindrical nesting doll, predominantly white with blue and green floral patterns.  Initially, the blue nesting doll is lying down and rolls out of the frame, revealing another nesting doll behind it that is also lying down and rolling on the surface. **\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows a minimalistic indoor setting with a plain white background.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a wide shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\nThe caption is generally well-written and follows many of the instructions, but it contains a significant inaccuracy regarding the spatial framing and shot size.\n\n*   **Accuracy:**\n    *   **Partially Inaccurate:** The most critical error is the phrase, \"This transition shifts the shot size to a wide view.\" The camera's framing and distance from the scene do not change. Therefore, the shot size remains constant throughout the video. What changes is the subject; a large subject is replaced by a much smaller one, which makes the frame *feel* emptier, but it is not a \"wide view.\" A more accurate description would state that the focus shifts to a smaller subject within the same static frame.\n    *   **Debatable:** The initial description as a \"medium shot\" is arguable. Given the vertical orientation and how much of the frame the doll occupies, it could be more accurately described as a **close-up** or **medium close-up**.\n    *   **Accurate:** The description of the subjects, their colors, their position in the foreground, and their movement from left to right is correct. The description of the background and the level camera height is also accurate.\n\n*   **Completeness:**\n    *   The caption successfully covers all the required elements: shot size (though inaccurately described), 2D and 3D position, depth, camera height, and movement. It correctly identifies the initial subject, the transition, and the final subject.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   The caption adheres to the one-paragraph format, uses simple and natural English, and avoids emotional or speculative language.\n    *   However, its primary failure is in accurately describing the **spatial dynamics**, specifically by misinterpreting the change in subject size as a change in shot size.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is **not good** because of the fundamental error in describing the shot size transition. While it follows the structural and stylistic rules, the factual inaccuracy about the spatial framing makes it a poor description of the video's cinematography.\n\nHere is a revised version that corrects the error:\n\n\"The video begins with a close-up of a cylindrical nesting doll lying on its side in the foreground at the bottom left of the frame. The doll rolls from left to right and exits the frame, revealing a much smaller, blue nesting doll that emerges from within it. The shot remains static as this smaller doll, now the main subject, continues to roll slowly from the bottom left to the right, staying in the foreground. The background is a solid white surface, and the camera remains at a level height with the subjects throughout the action.\"",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with a close-up of a large, patterned nesting doll lying on its side in the bottom left foreground. The doll rolls from left to right, and as it moves, a much smaller, solid blue nesting doll emerges from within it. The larger doll rolls completely out of the static frame, leaving the smaller doll as the new subject. The small doll then continues to roll slowly from left to right across the foreground. The entire scene is set against a plain white background, with the camera remaining at a fixed, level position.",
