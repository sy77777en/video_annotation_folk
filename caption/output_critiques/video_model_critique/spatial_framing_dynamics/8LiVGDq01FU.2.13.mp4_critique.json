    "pre_caption": "This is a close-up shot focusing on a person in a spacesuit. The person is positioned slightly right of center in the foreground. In the background, horizontal bars emitting bright light are visible, stretching across the middle and upper parts of the frame. The scene remains static throughout the clip, with no changes in framing or subject position. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a person wearing a dark spacesuit with a helmet that has a clear visor. The helmet reflects light, revealing the person's face inside, which appears focused and intent. The spacesuit is detailed with various panels and fastenings, suggesting a high-tech design. The person is oriented slightly to the side, with their head turned to the right, indicating attentiveness to something outside the frame. The lighting is dim, casting shadows that accentuate the contours of the suit and helmet.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place in a dimly lit indoor setting. A person wearing a white and grey astronaut suit occupies the foreground. The suit features a helmet with a clear, reflective visor and a circular emblem on the chest. The background, though blurred, contains prominent horizontal bars emitting a bright white light, possibly part of a larger structure or machinery. The scene is characterized by low-key lighting with high contrast between the illuminated elements and the surrounding darkness.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work. The caption is a perfect example of how to follow the instructions.\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description is entirely accurate. It correctly identifies the shot as a close-up, the subject's position as slightly right of center in the foreground, and the background elements as horizontal bright lights. The assessment that the scene is static and the camera is at the subject's level is also correct.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is very complete. It successfully addresses all the required components of the instructions: shot size, the 2D and 3D positions of the subject and key background elements, the camera's height, and the lack of any spatial changes or movement.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres flawlessly to all constraints. It is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English. It avoids subjective language, speculation, and any information not visible in the video. It systematically breaks down the spatial framing of the scene as requested.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is a static, eye-level close-up of a person in a spacesuit. The subject is in the foreground, positioned slightly to the right of the frame's center. In the dark background, several horizontal bars of bright light are visible across the middle and upper portions of the scene. The framing and the subject's position do not change.",
