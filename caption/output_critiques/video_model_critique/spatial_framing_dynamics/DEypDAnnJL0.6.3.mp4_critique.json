    "pre_caption": "The frame presents two static, medium close-up shots simultaneously. The main shot features a woman in a yellow shirt positioned in the center foreground, with a plain wall visible in the background. A smaller, secondary video feed is overlaid in the bottom-right corner of the screen, displaying a second woman in a gray sweater who is centered in the foreground of her own frame. In her background, string lights are visible to the left, and a painting hangs on the wall behind her. The camera for both subjects is positioned at their eye level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two women on a video call. The main subject is a woman with curly hair, wearing a yellow shirt with floral designs. She occupies the entire screen and appears to be in a neutral or slightly concerned expression. In the bottom-right corner, a smaller video overlay shows another woman with straight hair and bangs, wearing a gray sweater over a white shirt. Her expression seems attentive or engaged. This overlay covers about 25% of the screen, partially blocking the view of the woman in yellow. The setting suggests a digital communication context.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is a recording of a computer screen with two split-screen windows, one larger main screen and one smaller inset window, showing a virtual conversation between two individuals. The setting is indoors, with one person in a room featuring plain walls and soft lighting, suggesting a casual, home environment. The other individual appears in a smaller inset window, possibly in a different location with dim lighting and a visible background that includes string lights and a fairly large painting on the wall behind. The time of day is not explicitly clear, but the lighting suggests it could be evening. The overall scene focuses on the interaction between the two individuals, highlighting the digital communication aspect.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The frame shows two separate video feeds, each displaying a medium close-up of a woman, suggesting they are on a video call. The woman in yellow occupies the entire screen, while the woman in gray appears in a smaller video overlay in the bottom-right corner, covering about 25% of the screen and partially blocking a small part of the woman in yellow.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The video contains two separate frames, both with the camera positioned at the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly describes the main subject's shirt as \"yellow\" when it is tan or beige. It also inaccurately generalizes the camera angle for both subjects; the camera for the main subject is at a slightly low angle, while the camera for the woman in the overlay is at eye level. Furthermore, the caption describes the shots as \"static,\" which applies to the cameras but omits the subjects' movements. The main subject's facial expression changes, and the woman in the overlay is speaking, which are relevant dynamic details that should be included. Finally, describing the background object as a \"painting\" is an assumption; \"framed art\" is a more accurate term.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The frame presents two simultaneous medium close-up shots. The larger, main shot features a woman with curly hair in a tan t-shirt. She looks up with a worried expression, her eyes welling with tears and her lower lip trembling as if she is about to cry. The camera is positioned at a slightly low angle, and a plain wall is behind her. In a smaller video feed overlaid in the bottom-right corner, a second woman with bangs and red lipstick speaks with a serious expression. She wears a gray sweater over a collared shirt. The camera is at her eye level. In her background, string lights are visible to the left, and framed art hangs on the wall behind her.",
