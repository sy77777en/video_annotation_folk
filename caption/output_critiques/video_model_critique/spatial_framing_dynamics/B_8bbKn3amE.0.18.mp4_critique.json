    "pre_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot where the camera moves rapidly forward from an aerial perspective, flying through a deep crevasse in a glacier. Initially, large, fractured ice formations occupy the foreground on the left and right, framing the central chasm. In the background, the upper part of the glacier extends towards the top of the frame, with a dark, rocky mountain visible on the right under a cloudy sky. As the camera plunges into the crevasse, the towering ice walls fill the left and right sides of the frame, while the path ahead remains in the center. The shot continues its forward motion, revealing more of the glacier's textured, icy surface in the middle ground, with the mountain remaining in the background on the right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an aerial scenery shot that plunges the viewer through the dramatic landscape of a massive glacier. The camera navigates at high speed through a deep, narrow crevasse, flanked by towering walls of jagged, fractured ice and compacted snow. The ice within the chasm reveals a pale blue tint, contrasting with the bright white snow on the upper surfaces and the dark, rocky mountain face that borders the glacier under an overcast sky. There is no main subject in this video; the focus is entirely on conveying the immense scale, raw texture, and imposing atmosphere of the glacial environment. The rapid movement and close proximity to the ice formations emphasize the vastness and intricate details of the natural wonder rather than a specific focal point.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a high-speed flight through a deep crevasse in a vast glacier. The towering walls of the crevasse are composed of white snow and dense, light-blue ice with a rough, fractured texture. To the side, a steep, dark brown and black rocky mountain face contrasts with the bright ice. The sky above is uniformly gray and overcast. The drone moves swiftly along the narrow channel, offering a close-up perspective of the immense ice formations.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption provides a highly accurate, complete, and well-structured description that perfectly adheres to all instructions.\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is entirely accurate. It correctly identifies the scene as a glacier with a deep crevasse, a rocky mountain, and a cloudy sky. The description of the camera's rapid forward movement through the crevasse is precise.\n*   **Completeness and Spatial Framing:** The caption is exceptionally thorough. It successfully integrates all the required spatial elements:\n    *   **Shot Size:** Correctly identifies the shot as a \"wide scenery shot.\"\n    *   **Position (2D/3D):** It masterfully describes the 2D positions (left, right, center, top) and 3D depth (foreground, middle ground, background) of all key elements, such as the \"ice formations occupy the foreground on the left and right\" and the \"mountain remaining in the background on the right.\"\n    *   **Height:** The phrase \"from an aerial perspective\" accurately captures the camera's high-angle position.\n*   **Dynamics and Movement:** The description of the camera's movement (\"moves rapidly forward,\" \"plunges into the crevasse\") and the resulting change in framing (\"the towering ice walls fill the left and right sides of the frame\") is clear and effectively conveys the dynamic nature of the shot.\n*   **Adherence to Constraints:** The caption strictly follows the negative constraints. It uses simple, objective language, avoids speculation or emotional adjectives, and is presented as a single, coherent paragraph.\n\nThe caption is an exemplary execution of the provided instructions, offering a detailed and precise analysis of the video's spatial composition and dynamics.",
