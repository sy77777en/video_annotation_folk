    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a high-angle long shot, capturing a vast area of reddish-brown ground filled with hundreds of people lying in rows that stretch from the bottom of the frame into the background. A train is positioned in the top left background, with a wooden support structure in the left middle ground and a water tower in the lower right middle ground. As the camera pulls backward, a large, tattered Confederate flag enters from the bottom left foreground, waving as it moves to occupy the entire left side of the frame. This movement reframes the initial scene, pushing the view of the people and the train station into the right half and background of the composition. The camera's height, initially high above the people, lowers to become level with the flag in the foreground by the end of the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A high-angle view reveals a vast, open area of reddish-brown dirt covered with hundreds of people, predominantly men, lying in organized rows. These individuals are positioned either on their backs or face down. Most of these men are dressed in 19th-century attire, including dark blue and grey military-style uniforms. Several women, wearing long dark dresses and white bonnets, walk among the prone figures, along with men in similar clothing, some of whom are carrying others on stretchers. As the view pulls back, a large, tattered Confederate battle flag—red with a blue saltire containing white stars—enters from the lower left, waving as it moves to occupy a significant portion of the foreground.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a high-angle, daytime shot, a vast, open expanse of reddish-brown dirt next to a train station is densely packed with wounded and deceased soldiers lying in rows on the ground. Train tracks cut through the scene, with a train visible on the left and a wooden water tower with a conical roof in the lower right. A wooden support structure is visible on the left side, and two pots emitting white smoke can be seen among the crowd. A few individuals walk among the prone figures. From the lower-left corner, a large, tattered red flag with a blue saltire and white stars—a Confederate battle flag—waves in the wind, partially covering the view.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The shot begins as a long shot, with a high-angle aerial view of people lying on the ground. As the camera moves backward, a flag enters the frame from the left, eventually occupying about half of the screen.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The shot begins with an extreme wide shot of many people lying on the ground with no clear focus. The camera is initially above the subject and finally at the same height as the flag in the foreground.",
