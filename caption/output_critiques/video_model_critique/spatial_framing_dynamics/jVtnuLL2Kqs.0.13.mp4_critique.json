    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide shot of the scenery. The River Thames occupies the bottom of the frame, extending from the foreground to the middle ground, with a large barge positioned in the bottom left foreground. The London Eye is the central element, located in the middle of the frame and rising from the middle ground. To its left, modern buildings are situated in the middle ground and background, while a long classical building stretches across the right side of the frame in the middle ground. The cloudy sky fills the top half of the frame in the background, with a small airplane visible in the top center. The camera is positioned at a low angle, close to the water level. A white logo is overlaid in the bottom right corner of the frame. The shot is static with no camera movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a dramatic cityscape scenery shot featuring the London Eye, a massive white Ferris wheel, set against a sky filled with heavy, grey and white clouds. The wheel is positioned over the rippling waters of the River Thames, which occupies the foreground along with a large barge and extends to the middleground. In the middleground, older, classical-style buildings line the riverbank, while a mix of modern skyscrapers stretches from the middleground to the background, with a small airplane occasionally visible in the sky. The shot intentionally lacks a single main subject, as the wide composition and moody, desaturated color palette are used to convey the grand scale and somber atmosphere of the urban environment rather than focusing on a specific object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene captures the London Eye from across the River Thames on an overcast day. The large, white Ferris wheel stands centrally against a sky filled with dense, grey clouds, with a small airplane occasionally flying across the sky above it. The rippling water of the river fills the foreground and extends to the middle ground, where large barges are moored on both sides. Along the far bank, modern high-rise buildings are visible to the left of the wheel, while a long, classical-style building stretches to the right. The video is presented in a widescreen format with black bars at the top and bottom, and a white logo overlay is situated in the bottom-right corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The description of the airplane as \"occasionally visible\" is inaccurate; the airplane is continuously visible as it moves across the sky. The statement \"with barges positioned on both sides of the middle ground\" is also imprecise; the video shows a large, dark barge or pier on the left and a smaller, white tour boat on the right. Finally, the description of the camera movement as \"combining a right pan with a leftward trucking motion\" could be simplified to \"trucks left while panning right\" for better clarity and conciseness.",

The London Eye is the central focus, flanked by modern buildings on the left and a long classical building on the right. A small airplane moves continuously across the sky above. The camera trucks left while panning right. A white logo is overlaid in the bottom right corner.",
