    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective, the shot begins as a close-up on a pair of gloved hands in the center foreground, securing a rope to a large wooden post that occupies the center of the frame. A digital heads-up display is positioned on the left. The camera then tilts downward, transitioning to a high-angle shot that reveals a misty town with illuminated buildings in the distant background. In this new composition, the wooden post is framed in the right foreground, and a portion of a rifle is visible in the bottom-left foreground. Finally, a coiled rope is thrown from the top of the frame, unfurling as a glowing line that travels down through the center of the scene, stretching from the foreground over the town in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person perspective seen through a green night-vision filter, a pair of hands wearing dark, textured gloves secures a thick, light-colored rope around a large wooden post. The left wrist features a dark-colored band with a watch-like device. The hands use a metal carabiner to fasten the rope to the post. Subsequently, a coiled portion of the rope is thrown downwards, unfurling into a long, glowing cyan line against the backdrop of a dark, distant town with illuminated buildings.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a scene at night through a green-tinted night vision filter. Gloved hands are shown securing a light-colored rope with a metal carabiner to a thick, textured wooden post in a grassy area. The perspective then tilts upward to a level angle, revealing a view from a high elevation overlooking a misty town with lights glowing in the windows of its buildings. The rope is thrown and uncoils, appearing as a bright green line against the dark landscape as it falls. A green digital heads-up display (HUD) with numerical data is present as an overlay on the left side of the view.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption inaccurately describes the camera angle after the initial action. It states the camera transitions to a \"level-angle shot,\" but the view of the town is clearly a high-angle shot, looking down from a significant height. This should be corrected to \"high-angle shot.\" Additionally, for improved accuracy and adherence to the instructions, the caption should specify the shot sizes, starting with an extreme close-up on the hands and post, then transitioning to a wide shot of the town. The sentence about the heads-up display is separate and could be integrated into the first sentence for better flow. Finally, the caption omits the middle-ground elements revealed after the camera tilts, such as a roof and a light post below the camera's position, which are visible before the rope is thrown.",
