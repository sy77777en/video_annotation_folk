    "pre_caption": "The video shows a medium shot of a person with a bare torso, viewed from behind. Initially, the person occupies approximately 30% of the frame's height, positioned centrally in the middle ground. The subject is located in the center of the frame, both horizontally and vertically. A significant portion of the frame, around 60% of the width, is initially obscured by a black wall on the left and right sides, leaving only the center part visible. As the video progresses, the camera moves forward, reducing the black obstruction and gradually revealing more of the indoor setting. This transition shifts the black wall from occupying most of the frame to being pushed towards the edges, allowing a clearer view of the textured, dark walls in the background. The person remains centered throughout, with their upper body consistently in focus. The camera maintains a position at the subject's height, ensuring the upper body and back remain the focal point. The final state of the video settles on a medium shot, with the subject still centrally positioned and the indoor environment more fully revealed in the background. The lighting remains subdued, casting soft shadows and emphasizing the contours of the figure's back. The overall spatial dynamics highlight the gradual unveiling of the setting while keeping the subject as the primary focus.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a person with a bare torso, viewed from behind. The individual has short, dark hair and a light skin tone. Initially, the person occupies a smaller portion of the frame, with a significant part obscured by a black wall. As the video progresses, the obstruction diminishes, revealing more of the indoor setting and settling on a medium shot of the person. The focus remains on the upper body, highlighting the person's back and shoulders.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents an indoor setting with a dimly lit, narrow room featuring textured, dark walls. The environment is stark and minimalistic, with a focus on the central figure positioned in the middle of the scene. The walls have a rough, uneven surface, adding to the austere atmosphere. The lighting is subdued, casting soft shadows and highlighting the contours of the figure's back. The overall color palette is muted, dominated by earthy tones. Overlay elements include a small icon in the bottom left corner, which reads \"[8]\" and is not part of the scene.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a person with their torso bare, filmed from behind. Initially, the person occupies 30% of the frame's height, with only the upper body visible. At the beginning, 60% of the frame's width is blocked by what appears to be a black wall, only the center part where the subject is appears visible. As the camera moves forward, the black obstruction decreases, gradually revealing more of the indoor environment. The video ultimately settles on a medium shot of the person.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on your instructions, here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\nThe caption is well-written and adheres to many of the instructions, but it contains a significant inaccuracy regarding the subject's spatial position and could be more concise.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **Shot Size:** The use of \"medium shot\" is accurate, as the frame captures the person from approximately the waist up.\n*   **Position:** The description of the subject being in the \"center of the frame, both horizontally and vertically\" is **incorrect**. The subject is positioned in the **bottom center** of the frame; the entire top half of the frame is empty, dark space.\n*   **Movement/Dynamics:** The description of the camera moving forward and the black obstruction receding to reveal more of the background is an excellent and accurate observation of the video's primary spatial dynamic.\n*   **Camera Height:** The statement that the camera is \"at the subject's height\" is accurate.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully covers shot size, position (with the noted error), depth, camera height, and the change in framing over time. It correctly identifies the initial and final states of the shot.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths:** The caption correctly avoids emotional language, speculative statements, and focuses on the requested spatial elements. It describes the subject and background elements as instructed.\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   **Conciseness:** The caption is slightly repetitive. For instance, it states the subject is \"positioned centrally,\" \"in the center of the frame,\" and \"remains centered\" multiple times. This could be streamlined.\n    *   **Clarity:** The description of the black obstruction as a \"black wall\" is a reasonable interpretation, but describing it as a framing element or an opening might be slightly more precise to the visual effect.\n\n### Revised Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised version of the caption that corrects the inaccuracies and improves conciseness while adhering to all instructions:\n\nA medium shot shows a person with a bare torso from behind, positioned in the bottom center of the frame and the middle ground of the scene. Initially, the view is constricted by black framing on the left and right sides. As the video progresses, the camera moves forward, causing the black framing to recede toward the edges and reveal more of the dark, textured walls in the background. The person remains fixed in the bottom-center of the frame throughout this movement, with the camera maintaining a position at their height.",
