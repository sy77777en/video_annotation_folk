    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a man positioned in the center foreground, hanging against a city backdrop. A skyscraper occupies the left middle ground, while a large building with a grid of lit windows is on the right middle ground. In the background, more city buildings are visible between the two main structures. As the man struggles and swings his body upward, the framing transitions into a full shot, revealing his entire body moving across the top of the frame. He remains in the foreground, while the cityscape stays in the middle ground and background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout the action.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A medium-skinned man with short, dark hair is shown hanging by his hands. He is wearing a light-colored, short-sleeved shirt and dark pants. His face is contorted in an expression of physical strain as he struggles, pulling his body upward and swinging his legs. The video starts with a medium shot and transitions to a full-body view as he moves.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set at night, high above a dense city, with a view framed between towering skyscrapers. To the right, a large, dark office building is illuminated by a grid of hundreds of bright, square windows. To the left and in the distance, other high-rise buildings with lit interiors contribute to the sprawling urban glow. Far below, the faint streaks of red and white lights indicate traffic moving along a city street. In the foreground, a person is suspended on a structure, set against the backdrop of the nocturnal cityscape.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subject’s framing (shot size) is not stable** throughout the video, so the description should emphasize this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
