    "pre_caption": "The video features a wide shot of an elephant moving through a forested area. Initially, the elephant is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. As it walks, it shifts slightly to the right, maintaining its position in the middle ground. The forest, with its tall, slender trees, forms a natural frame around the elephant. These trees are positioned in the foreground and background, creating depth and emphasizing the elephant's path through the scene. The camera remains at the elephant's level throughout, capturing its steady movement and interaction with the environment. The spatial composition remains consistent, with the elephant navigating between the trees, which are evenly distributed across the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features an elephant walking through a forested area. The elephant is large, with a gray, wrinkled hide and prominent tusks curving outward. Its ears are large and flap slightly as it moves. The forest is dense with tall, slender trees that have light-colored bark, creating a natural frame around the elephant. The elephant's movement is steady, and it appears to be navigating through the trees with ease. The setting suggests a natural habitat, emphasizing the elephant's presence in the wild.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor scene in a forested area with numerous tall, slender trees featuring pale, smooth bark. The setting is during the day, with natural light filtering through the tree canopy, creating a serene atmosphere. The ground is covered with sparse grass and patches of earth. An elephant is present, moving through the trees, its large, gray body and tusks contrasting with the lighter tree trunks. The environment is calm, with no visible weather disturbances, and the scene remains consistent throughout, focusing on the natural interaction between the elephant and its surroundings.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption inaccurately describes the shot size as a \"wide shot\"; a \"medium-long shot\" is more precise, as the elephant is the clear subject and is shown in its entirety. The description of the elephant's movement is also imprecise; instead of starting in the center and shifting \"slightly to the left,\" the elephant walks more definitively from the right-center of the frame toward the left. The description of the trees is incomplete, as it only mentions them in the foreground and background, while they also exist in the middle ground alongside the elephant. Finally, the last two sentences (\"The camera remains at the elephant's level throughout, capturing its steady movement and interaction with the environment. The spatial composition remains consistent, with the elephant navigating between the trees, which are evenly distributed across the frame.\") are partially redundant and interpretive. The caption should be revised to state: \"A medium-long shot captures an elephant in the middle ground, walking from the right-center of the frame toward the left. A dense forest of pale-barked trees occupies the foreground, middle ground, and background, with several prominent foreground trees partially obscuring the view of the elephant and creating a sense of depth. The camera is positioned at the elephant's level and remains static throughout the shot.\"",
