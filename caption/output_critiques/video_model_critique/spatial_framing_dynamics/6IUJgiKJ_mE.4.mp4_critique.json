    "pre_caption": "The video features a wide shot of two cyclists on a long, open road. The cyclist on the left, wearing a yellow and black jersey, is positioned in the bottom left of the frame, while the cyclist on the right, in a white and black jersey, is in the bottom center. Both cyclists are in the foreground, moving away from the viewer. The road stretches into the background, with vehicles and people visible along the roadside, indicating a race or event. The camera is positioned above the cyclists, capturing the expansive rural landscape with grassy fields on either side. The road's straight path and the cyclists' movement create a sense of progression and depth within the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two cyclists riding on a long, open road. The cyclist on the left wears a yellow and black jersey with the number 34, black shorts, and a helmet. The cyclist on the right wears a white and black jersey, black shorts, and a helmet, riding a bicycle with a dark frame. Both cyclists shift from the center to the right side of the road as they move away from the viewer. In the distance, several vehicles and people are visible along the roadside, indicating a race or organized event. The road is straight and stretches into the horizon, flanked by grassy fields.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor scene on a long, straight road stretching into the distance under a clear blue sky, indicating daytime. The setting is a rural area with open fields on either side, bordered by low vegetation and distant tree lines. The road is paved with a smooth surface, marked by yellow and white lines. Two cyclists are prominently featured, riding along the road, with their colorful jerseys and bicycles adding dynamic elements to the scene. Vehicles and a few people are visible in the background, suggesting a cycling event or race. The overall atmosphere is calm and expansive, with the road and landscape creating a sense of movement and progression.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is good but could be improved by adhering more strictly to the instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the shot size as a wide shot, the two main subjects as cyclists, their clothing colors, their 2D and 3D positions, the camera's high-angle position, and the surrounding environment.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is mostly complete. It covers shot size, 2D/3D position, and camera height as requested. However, it could be more specific about the spatial dynamics. While it mentions the cyclists' movement, it doesn't explicitly state that the camera is also moving forward in a follow shot, which is why the cyclists remain consistently in the foreground. It also misses describing how the roadside elements (the parked car and people) move through and out of the frame as the camera passes them.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption deviates from the instructions in two key areas:\n1.  **Speculation:** The phrase \"indicating a race or event\" is an interpretation of the scene's context, not a direct description of spatial framing. The instructions explicitly state to \"Avoid speculative statements.\" A better approach would be to simply describe the presence of other vehicles and people on the roadside.\n2.  **Interpretive Language:** The final sentence, \"create a sense of progression and depth,\" describes the *effect* of the composition on the viewer. The instructions ask for a description of the spatial framing itself, not an analysis of its psychological or artistic impact. A more compliant description would focus on the visual cues that create depth, such as the road lines converging in the background.\n\nIn summary, the caption successfully describes the static spatial arrangement but is less precise about the dynamic movements and includes interpretive language that violates the negative constraints of the instructions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is a high-angle wide shot from a camera positioned behind and above two cyclists on a paved road. The camera moves forward in a follow shot, keeping the cyclists in the foreground as they ride away from the viewer. The cyclist on the left, wearing a yellow and black jersey with the number 34, occupies the lower-left portion of the frame. The second cyclist, in a white and black jersey, is positioned slightly ahead and to the right, near the center of the frame. The road stretches into the distant background, with its painted lines converging toward a vanishing point on the horizon. As the camera advances, a parked car and several people on the left roadside move from the middle ground and exit the frame on the left. Other cyclists and vehicles are visible in the distant background.",
