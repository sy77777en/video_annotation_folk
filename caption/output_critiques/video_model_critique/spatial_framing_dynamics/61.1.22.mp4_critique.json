    "pre_caption": "The video features a medium close-up shot of a man positioned slightly to the left of the center in the frame. He is in the foreground, with his head and upper torso visible. The background includes vibrant, warm lighting and decorative elements like neon signs and hanging flags, contributing to a lively atmosphere. The camera remains at the subject's eye level throughout the video. As the scene progresses, the man slightly shifts his position, moving his head and upper body, but remains primarily in the left-center of the frame. The background elements stay consistent, maintaining the festive indoor setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man with a medium-dark skin tone, wearing a large, light-colored hat and distinctive white, oversized sunglasses. He has long dreadlocks and a gray beard. His attire includes a green jacket over a colorful, patterned shirt, accessorized with layered necklaces. The man appears to be in a dimly lit indoor setting with vibrant, warm lighting and decorative elements like hanging flags and neon signs. His expression is neutral and suggests a casual or relaxed demeanor. **\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an indoor setting with a lively, festive atmosphere. The environment is dimly lit, with warm, ambient lighting from neon signs. The decor features colorful streamers hanging from the ceiling, contributing to a celebratory vibe. The walls are adorned with various decorations, enhancing the vibrant setting. The time of day is not explicitly clear due to the indoor lighting. The scene includes a subject wearing distinctive attire, such as a wide-brimmed hat, white sunglasses, and layered necklaces, adding to the eclectic and lively ambiance. The overall composition suggests a casual, social gathering space.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is partially successful but contains significant inaccuracies and omissions that violate the core instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **Incorrect Camera Height:** The most significant error is the statement, \"The camera remains at the subject's eye level throughout the video.\" The video is clearly filmed from a **low angle**, with the camera positioned below the subject's eye level and tilted upward. This framing choice is a key element of the shot and is misidentified in the caption.\n*   **Subjective Language:** The caption uses subjective and emotional adjectives like \"vibrant,\" \"warm,\" \"lively,\" and \"festive.\" The instructions explicitly state to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\"\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   **Incomplete Spatial Description of Background Elements:** The instructions require a description of both the 2D and 3D positions for as many elements as possible. While the caption mentions \"neon signs and hanging flags,\" it fails to specify their locations. For example, it should have noted the \"Patatas 2000\" neon sign is in the middle ground on the left and another neon sign is in the middle ground on the right.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   The caption correctly identifies the shot size as a \"medium close-up\" and accurately describes the subject's position in the foreground and his minor movements.\n*   It follows the single-paragraph format and uses simple English.\n*   However, it fails on three key instructions: accurately describing the camera's height, avoiding subjective language, and providing detailed spatial positioning for background elements.\n\nIn summary, the caption correctly identifies the main subject and his basic framing but fails to accurately describe the camera angle and does not provide the required level of detail for background elements, while also including prohibited subjective language.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features a medium close-up shot of a man, filmed from a low angle looking up at him. He is positioned in the foreground, slightly to the left of the center of the frame, with his head and upper torso visible. The background is an indoor setting with red-hued lighting. In the middle ground on the left, a red neon sign reads \"Patatas 2000\". Another red neon sign is visible in the middle ground on the right. Small flags hang from the ceiling in the upper portion of the frame. As the scene progresses, the man slightly shifts his position, moving his head and upper body, but remains primarily in the left-center of the frame. The background elements stay consistent, maintaining the indoor setting.",
