    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot from an eye-level perspective on a sidewalk, which occupies the bottom-left foreground. The camera slowly pans to the right, altering the composition. Initially, a modern building is prominent in the left foreground and middle ground, while a multi-lane road with moving traffic fills the center and right middle ground. In the background, a tall, beige hotel stands on the right, under a blue sky at the top of the frame. As the camera pans right, the building on the left recedes, and the focus shifts towards the road and the buildings on the opposite side. The hotel on the right moves more towards the center of the frame, and a convenience store next to it becomes visible in the right background. Throughout the pan, vehicles like a blue car, a dark bus, and a silver van travel across the middle ground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a dynamic cityscape scenery shot of a wide, sunlit street in a modern Japanese city. The camera moves forward while simultaneously panning to the right, offering a view from a clean, tiled sidewalk down a multi-lane road where traffic, including a blue compact car and a silver van, flows smoothly. The street is lined with contemporary buildings, most notably a tall, beige hotel on the right, and is separated by a median strip with green trees under a bright blue sky with fluffy white clouds. The moving perspective captures the overall atmosphere and scale of the urban environment, focusing on the peaceful, orderly rhythm of city life rather than any specific entity.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, shows a wide city street in Japan on a sunny day. The perspective is from a broad sidewalk paved with gray and white checkered tiles and a yellow tactile strip. To the left, a modern building features dark, slatted panels at its base. Across the multi-lane asphalt road, traffic, including cars, vans, and a bus, moves along the street. Green belts with trees and lampposts run along both sides of the road. The opposite side of the road is lined with buildings, including a tall, light-yellow hotel with a red star logo. The scene is set under a bright blue sky with scattered white clouds, and a few pedestrians walk on the sidewalk in the distance.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly states the modern building is in the \"left foreground\"; it is located entirely in the left middle ground, with the sidewalk occupying the foreground. The description omits the pedestrians walking on the sidewalk in the left middle ground. Additionally, the description of vehicle movement, \"travel across the middle ground,\" could be more precise by specifying their direction of travel is from right to left. Finally, for conciseness, the phrase \"under a blue sky at the top of the frame\" could be removed, as the sky's position is implicit in a wide outdoor shot.",
