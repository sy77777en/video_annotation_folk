    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of an urban street scene at night, capturing a broad view of the surroundings. Initially, the camera focuses on the left side of the scene, showing a bus stop sign in the foreground on the left, with a Gulf gas station visible in the middle ground on the right. The bus stop sign is positioned in the bottom left corner of the frame, while the gas station occupies the center-right portion. The gas station's signage is illuminated, standing out against the dark sky. In the background, streetlights and traffic signals are scattered across the scene, illuminating the road and buildings. As the video progresses, the camera pans slightly to the right, shifting the focus more towards the gas station and the street in front of it. The gas station moves closer to the center of the frame, while the bus stop sign moves out of view. The camera remains at a consistent height, likely mounted on a vehicle, providing a steady perspective throughout the video. The overall spatial composition maintains a clear view of the road, the gas station, and the surrounding urban environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot. The focus is on the urban environment, capturing the atmosphere of a city at night. The emphasis is on the overall setting, including the gas station, streetlights, and surrounding streets, rather than a specific object or subject.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a dashcam POV mounted on a vehicle, shows an urban street scene at night. The setting is outdoors, featuring a well-lit intersection with a Gulf gas station prominently visible. Streetlights and traffic signals illuminate the area, casting light on the road and surrounding structures. A noticeable silver sedan is parked, and a bus is visible on the left side. In the foreground, a sign with the numbers \"273,\" \"291,\" and \"309\" is clearly visible. The camera pans to the right, revealing more parked vehicles and the entire gas station. The environment is calm, with clear weather conditions, allowing for a clear view of the road and the gas station's signage. **\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption.\n\n### Feedback\n\nThe caption is generally well-written and follows most of the instructions. It correctly identifies the shot size, the overall scene, and the camera movement. However, there are significant inaccuracies and omissions regarding the specific elements within the frame.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **Incorrect Subject Identification:** The most significant error is identifying the prominent foreground sign as a \"bus stop sign.\" It is clearly a gas price sign, showing prices like 273, 291, and 309.\n*   **Incorrect Positioning:** The caption states the sign is in the \"bottom left corner,\" but it is more accurately positioned in the left-center foreground of the initial shot.\n*   **Minor Inaccuracy:** The caption says the camera \"focuses on the left side of the scene\" initially. While the prominent sign is on the left, the overall shot is more of a centered view of the intersection, with the Gulf station on the right and a bus on the far left, giving it a balanced composition.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption fails to mention several key elements that help define the space and activity in the scene. It omits the articulated bus visible in the middle ground on the left, the silver minivan parked at the gas station, and the dark SUV that pulls into the station as the camera pans. Mentioning these vehicles would provide a more complete picture of the scene's composition.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Spatial Framing:** The caption does a good job of describing the shot size (wide shot), depth (foreground, middle ground, background), and camera movement (pan right).\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The language is clear and the paragraph is coherent.\n*   **Objectivity:** The description avoids subjective or emotional language.\n*   **Speculation:** The phrase \"likely mounted on a vehicle\" is a minor deviation from the instruction to avoid speculation. However, given the visible dashboard at the bottom of the frame, it is a very strong and reasonable inference rather than pure speculation.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe caption successfully describes the general spatial dynamics but fails on the details. The misidentification of the main foreground subject is a major flaw. To be good, the caption must accurately identify the key objects it describes and be more comprehensive in listing the salient elements that define the scene's composition.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is a wide shot from a vehicle's perspective, looking at an urban street intersection at night. Initially, the frame is stationary. In the left foreground, a tall, illuminated gas price sign displays the numbers 273, 291, and 309. In the middle ground, a Gulf gas station is visible on the right, with a silver minivan parked in front. On the far left, an articulated bus is stopped at the intersection. The background is filled with the glow of streetlights and traffic signals. The camera then begins a slow pan to the right, shifting the composition. As it pans, the Gulf gas station moves toward the center of the frame, and a dark SUV pulls into the station from the right. The gas price sign moves further to the left, and the bus on the far left moves out of the frame. The shot maintains its wide perspective throughout the movement.",
