    "pre_caption": "From a high-angle, first-person perspective, the subject's body occupies the bottom half of the frame in the foreground, with their legs positioned in the center. A partially constructed brick wall extends horizontally across the middle ground, from the left to the center of the frame. A concrete structure is visible along the entire right side of the scene, while a bucket of mortar sits in the bottom left foreground. Initially, the subject's left hand is in the bottom left, and their right hand holds a brick in the bottom right foreground. The hands move toward the center to handle the brick together before moving it forward and placing it onto the wall in the center middle ground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person perspective, a man with brown skin is shown laying bricks. He is wearing dark shorts with a pink and purple pattern, a light-colored shirt, and blue flip-flops. A black bracelet is visible on his right forearm. His hands are covered in grey mortar as he holds a rectangular, reddish-orange brick, preparing to place it on a partially constructed wall in front of him. The wall is also made of red bricks, with a fresh layer of wet mortar on the top course.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, the scene is set at an outdoor construction site during the day. A person is in the process of laying a course of reddish-orange, rough-textured bricks onto a low wall using wet, grey mortar. The ground consists of uneven reddish-brown dirt and rubble, with a blue coiled cord and other construction debris visible in the background. A white string is positioned to the right of the person's legs, lying on the ground. To the right, a grey, rough-surfaced concrete structure forms a set of stairs.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is mostly accurate but has a few inaccuracies and omissions. The partially constructed brick wall is described as extending across \"both the foreground and middle ground,\" but it is located entirely in the middle ground. Consequently, the final action of placing the brick occurs in the \"center middle ground,\" not the \"center foreground\" as stated. Additionally, the caption fails to mention a prominent spatial element: the white guide string stretched horizontally across the middle ground, just above the wall. It also omits the construction debris visible in the background at the top of the frame.",
