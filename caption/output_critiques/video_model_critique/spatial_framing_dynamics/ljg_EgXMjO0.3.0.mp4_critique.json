    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a seal positioned in the foreground at the bottom center of the frame, viewed from a high angle. In the background, multiple horizontal rows of lotus flowers occupy the top half of the scene. A procession of penguins on platforms then enters from the right side of the frame, moving left across the middle ground, positioned behind the seal. As they pass, the seal, remaining in its foreground position, raises its flippers. The penguins continue moving left until they exit the frame, after which the seal also disappears from the bottom. The scene then transitions to a view of three elephants standing in a row, occupying the center of the frame in the middle ground, with the lotus flower pattern still visible in the background. The camera perspective for the elephants appears to be at their eye level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a black and white pencil sketch animation, a light-colored seal with large, dark eyes and an open mouth floats on its back, facing upward towards the camera. It has prominent whiskers and at one point raises its flippers. A procession of black and white penguins with open beaks stands on small, blocky platforms. A line of three light-colored, cartoonish elephants also appears, standing on their hind legs in a dancing pose with their trunks raised. The background is composed of repeating horizontal rows of stylized, glowing lotus flowers.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a whimsical, monochromatic scene with a surreal, artistic style. The setting is outdoors, featuring a backdrop of stylized lotus flowers floating on water. The environment is calm and imaginative, with a focus on playful, cartoon-like creatures. In the first part, a seal-like creature is depicted with a textured, sketch-like appearance, swimming in the water. In the latter part, three elephant-like figures stand in a row, each with exaggerated features and a similar sketchy texture. Additionally, penguins are shown standing on ice blocks, adding to the imaginative landscape. The overall composition is characterized by its black-and-white color scheme and the creative, dreamlike quality of the characters and setting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

It should be replaced with a direct statement, such as \"The camera is positioned at their eye level.\" The phrase \"in this 2D video\" is redundant and should be removed. Additionally, the caption omits a description of the elephants' movement; it should mention that they are dancing or waving their arms, as this is a key spatial dynamic. Finally, the initial shot size of the seal (a medium shot) is not specified and should be included at the beginning of the description.",
