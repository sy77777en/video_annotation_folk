    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot from a high-angle, top-down perspective, an orange, amorphous figure is positioned in the center of the frame in the middle ground. The scene is framed by dark, tall walls that form a narrow corridor. In the top left, a white, curved object with red splatters is situated near the left wall, while a gray block rests against the right wall in the bottom right, both in the middle ground. As the video progresses, the camera follows the central orange figure as it moves forward through the maze-like corridor. Consequently, the surrounding walls and the static white and gray objects scroll past and exit the frame, while new sections of the corridor enter the view, maintaining the central figure's position within the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a bright orange, amorphous figure that resembles a running orangutan. Its shape is inconsistent, occasionally taking on a vaguely humanoid form.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view, the camera is placed directly above the character and looks down on them as they navigate a dark, abstract environment. The setting consists of a narrow, maze-like corridor with tall, black, textured walls and a solid dark gray-teal floor. An orange, particle-based shape moves forward through the center of the path. To the left, a white, curved object is positioned near a wall marked with red splatters, while a simple, light gray rectangular block is visible on the right. The camera follows the central shape's progression through the angular passages.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe provided caption is excellent. It is highly accurate, comprehensive, and perfectly adheres to all the given instructions. It successfully translates the visual information into a clear and concise descriptive paragraph.\n\n**Detailed Breakdown:**\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description of the subjects (orange figure, white object, gray block), their characteristics (\"amorphous,\" \"red splatters\"), and their spatial relationships is precise. The analysis of the movement—the camera following the central figure while the environment scrolls by—is spot-on.\n*   **Completeness:** The caption effectively covers all required elements:\n    *   **Shot Size:** Correctly identified as a \"wide shot.\"\n    *   **Camera Height/Angle:** Correctly described as a \"high-angle, top-down perspective.\"\n    *   **2D Position:** Accurately uses terms like \"center,\" \"top left,\" and \"bottom right.\"\n    *   **3D Position (Depth):** Correctly places all key elements in the \"middle ground.\"\n    *   **Movement/Dynamics:** Clearly explains the camera's tracking movement and how it affects the framing of the static and moving elements.\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   The caption is a single, coherent paragraph.\n    *   It uses simple, objective, and natural English.\n    *   It avoids speculation, emotional language, and ambiguity.\n    *   It focuses entirely on the spatial framing and dynamics as requested.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe caption is a model example of how to follow the instructions. It is factually correct, detailed without being verbose, and structured logically. No improvements are necessary.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a wide shot from a high-angle, top-down perspective, an orange, amorphous figure occupies the center of the frame in the middle ground, enclosed by the dark walls of a maze-like corridor. Also in the middle ground, a white, curved object with red splatters is in the top left, and a gray block is in the bottom right. As the video progresses, the camera tracks the orange figure's forward movement. Consequently, the surrounding walls and static objects scroll past and exit the frame, while the figure remains centered.",
