    "pre_caption": "This is a medium shot focusing on a large, leafless tree, viewed from a low angle looking upwards. The thick trunk occupies the bottom right foreground and extends towards the center. Numerous bare branches spread out from the trunk, filling the center, top left, and top right portions of the frame, positioned in the foreground and middle ground. The clear blue sky serves as the background, visible between the intricate network of branches, particularly in the top left and top center. A point of bright sunlight creates a lens flare near a branch in the top left middle ground. The framing remains static throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a large, leafless tree with a thick, textured trunk and numerous sprawling branches extending outward. The bark is rough and gray, with visible patterns and knots. The branches are bare, showcasing a network of smaller twigs against the sky. The tree's imposing structure and intricate details are highlighted, emphasizing its size and natural complexity.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor scene featuring a large, leafless tree with thick, textured branches extending outward against a clear blue sky. The tree's bark is rough and gray, with distinctive markings and a robust trunk. Sunlight filters through the branches, creating lens flares and subtle shadows on the tree's surface. The setting is serene and natural, with no visible human-made structures or movement, emphasizing the tree's grandeur and the open sky. The time of day appears to be midday, as indicated by the bright, direct sunlight illuminating the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "**Feedback on the Caption:**\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subject as a large, leafless tree and accurately describes its spatial arrangement. The placement of the trunk in the \"bottom right foreground,\" the branches filling the frame in the \"foreground and middle ground,\" and the sky as the \"background\" are all correct. The description of the low-angle perspective and the lens flare's position is also precise.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is very complete. It addresses all the required elements from the instructions: shot size (\"medium shot\"), 2D position (bottom right, center, top left), 3D depth (foreground, middle ground, background), camera height/angle (\"low angle looking upwards\"), and movement (\"framing remains static\"). It successfully captures all the essential spatial information of the scene.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres perfectly to all instructions. It is a single, concise paragraph written in simple, natural English. It avoids subjective language and speculation, focusing solely on the objective spatial framing and dynamics. The structure follows the requested format by detailing shot size, position, depth, and camera perspective.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A static, low-angle medium shot looks up at a large, leafless tree against a clear blue sky. The tree's thick trunk rises from the bottom right foreground, while its bare branches spread across the upper and central parts of the frame in the foreground and middle ground. The sky serves as the background, visible through the network of branches. In the top left, a lens flare from the sun appears near a branch.",
