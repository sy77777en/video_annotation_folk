    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot, the scene is set in a dark, foggy forest with silhouetted bare trees in the foreground on the left and right. A human figure in a red shirt is positioned in the middle ground, moving from left to right as the camera pans to follow. A horizontal red laser beam continuously sweeps across the middle ground from left to right. In the background on the right, a drone emerges from near a red lantern, flying forward into the middle ground while casting a conical red searchlight onto the terrain before exiting to the right. Evergreen trees and a thick fog are visible in the middle ground and background, and an \"IGN\" logo is overlaid in the bottom right corner. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a human figure with light skin and long hair, wearing a bright red shirt and dark pants, which stands out against the dark, misty forest setting. The individual appears alone among tall, thin trees, some of which are bare while others are evergreen, with the red shirt providing a stark contrast to the muted, shadowy tones of the surrounding environment. Additionally, a drone with a red light is visible, seemingly searching for the individual.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene in profile, the setting is a dark, foggy forest at night. The landscape is filled with silhouetted trees, including bare, spindly ones in the foreground and dense pines in the background, all set against a hazy, blue-tinted sky with faint light beams cutting through the mist. A thick layer of fog blankets the ground, which is dotted with patches of glowing green grass and small white plants. The camera moves from left to right, following the individual movement. A boxy black drone with a red light flies through the scene from the background to the foreground, casting a conical red searchlight onto the ground below. Additionally, a standing lantern with a red light is visible in the background, from where the drone appears. An \"IGN\" logo is visible as an overlay in the bottom right corner.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on the caption. It is accurate, detailed, and adheres very well to the provided instructions. Here is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n### Feedback\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the wide shot, the dark and foggy forest setting, the key subjects (figure, drone), their movements, and the environmental elements. The spatial positioning (foreground, middle ground, background, left/right) is precise.\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is very thorough. It successfully captures all the significant visual information and dynamic actions within the scene, including the camera pan, the figure's run, the sweeping laser, and the drone's flight path and searchlight. Mentioning the \"IGN\" logo is also a good detail.\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Spatial Framing:** You have done an excellent job describing the spatial framing. The use of terms like \"foreground,\" \"middle ground,\" \"background,\" \"left,\" \"right,\" and \"bottom right\" is consistent and correct.\n    *   **Dynamics:** The description of movement for both the subjects and the camera is clear and well-explained.\n    *   **Objectivity:** The language is neutral and descriptive, successfully avoiding subjective or speculative terms as instructed. For example, describing the setting as a \"dark, foggy forest\" is factual rather than emotional.\n    *   **Format:** The caption is a single, coherent paragraph, which follows the formatting rules.\n\n### Minor Suggestion for Improvement\n\n*   The phrase \"emerges from near a red lantern\" is a slight interpretation. While it looks like a lantern, a more strictly objective term would be \"red light source.\" However, this is a very minor point, and \"lantern\" is a reasonable description.\n\nOverall, the caption is of high quality and effectively fulfills all the requirements of the prompt. It demonstrates a strong understanding of how to analyze and describe visual information spatially and dynamically.",
