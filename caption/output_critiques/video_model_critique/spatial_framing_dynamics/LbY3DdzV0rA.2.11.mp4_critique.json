    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide scenery shot with no main subjects, focusing on a vast landscape. The frame is horizontally divided, with a dramatic sky occupying the top half and a deep canyon filling the bottom half. In the top left, the setting sun is positioned near the horizon. Large, dark storm clouds are situated in the top right and center-right of the frame. The expansive canyon stretches across the entire bottom of the frame, occupying the foreground and middle ground, and is cast in shadow. A small, winding river is visible in the bottom left, deep within the canyon in the middle ground. In this time-lapse, the sun on the left slowly descends below the horizon, and the clouds drift across the sky. The camera is positioned at a high angle, looking out over the canyon.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a landscape scenery shot capturing a dramatic time-lapse of a sunset over a vast canyon. The expansive canyon, with its layered rock formations, is cast in deep shadow, while a thin, reflective river winds through its base. The sky is a spectacle of contrasting elements: on the left, the setting sun creates a brilliant golden-orange glow with visible sunbeams, while on the right, dark, voluminous storm clouds gather in the distance. The clouds drift across the frame as the sun sinks, creating a dynamic interplay of light and shadow. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the immense scale of the natural environment and the powerful, atmospheric conditions, emphasizing the grandeur of the landscape rather than any single object within it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An extreme wide shot captures the Grand Canyon at sunset under a dramatic sky. On the left, the setting sun peeks over the horizon, casting a golden glow and creating a sunburst effect. The sky above is a mix of blue, illuminated white clouds, and large, dark, billowing storm clouds that dominate the right side of the frame. The vast, layered canyon below is mostly cast in deep shadow, emphasizing its depth and scale. A small, winding river snakes through the bottom of the canyon, reflecting the faint light from the sky. Throughout the scene, the clouds slowly drift and shift.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
