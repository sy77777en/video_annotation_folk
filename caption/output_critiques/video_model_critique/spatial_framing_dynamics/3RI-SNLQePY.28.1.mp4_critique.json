    "pre_caption": "In a static, eye-level shot, a stylized character is positioned in the right middle ground, partially behind a brown counter that occupies the foreground. A thought bubble appears at the top right, next to the character's head. In the background, a long shelf displaying five symbols spans the top of the frame. A user interface bar is located in the foreground at the very bottom of the screen. A white arrow cursor moves across the background shelf, hovering over the symbols. Small question marks appear and disappear in the center-left middle ground as the cursor moves.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A stylized, animated character with a detached head is depicted sitting behind a reddish-brown bar, which functions as a table. The character's head is a brown, bird-like mask resembling that of a plague doctor, complete with two small antlers, and it floats just above the neck of a body wearing a teal collared shirt. The character's visible arm is dark and segmented, holding a white mug. A thought bubble appears next to the character's head, containing geometric shapes, including two triangles, a quarter-circle, and a rod. Above the character is a long, light-colored rectangular machine that dispenses objects selected by the cursor. This machine displays a row of five simple drawings: a tooth, a crescent moon, a spider, two biscuits, and an acorn. A white arrow cursor moves across the screen, interacting with the symbols on the machine. More icons sit on top of the reddish-brown bar at the bottom; these include a cluster of buildings, a backpack, and an eyeball.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A screen recording of a software or system interface shows a 2D, hand-drawn video game with a muted color palette of gray, brown, and off-white. A character with a long-beaked mask and antlers sits at a brown counter near the bottom of the frame, holding a white cup. Above the character's detached head, a thought bubble containing a symbol appears. Behind the character, a long, light-colored shelf displays five simple drawings: a tooth, a crescent moon, a crab, two biscuits, and an acorn. The game's user interface is visible as an overlay, featuring a top bar with symbols and a bottom bar with various icons. A white arrow cursor moves across the top bar, and small question marks fall out of the machine as it hovers over the different symbols.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is missing several key spatial details required by the instructions. It fails to mention the shot size (medium shot) or the camera's height (straight-on). While it correctly identifies the 2D positions of elements, it does not consistently use 3D depth terms like foreground, middle ground, and background. For instance, it should specify that the counter and UI bar are in the foreground, the character is in the middle ground, and the display is in the background. The description of the question marks \"fall[ing] out of a machine\" is an interpretation; it should be corrected to state that they appear in the middle ground below the display and fall downwards. Finally, the cursor's movement should be described more precisely by noting its right-to-left direction.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a medium, straight-on shot of a 2D animated scene, a stylized character sits in the right middle ground. The character, who has a detached head wearing a plague doctor-like mask with antlers, holds a cup while a thought bubble containing a rune appears nearby. In the foreground, a brown counter spans the width of the frame, with a user interface bar at the very bottom. A long shelf in the background displays five symbols: a tooth, a crescent moon, a spider, two biscuits, and an acorn. A white arrow cursor moves across the shelf, hovering over the spider, then the moon, the tooth, and finally the biscuits. As the cursor moves, small black question marks appear in the middle ground below the shelf and fall downwards before vanishing.",
