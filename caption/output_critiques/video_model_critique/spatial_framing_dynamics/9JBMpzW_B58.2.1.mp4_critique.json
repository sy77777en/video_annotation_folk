    "pre_caption": "This video is a wide scenery shot captured from a high-angle perspective. The bow of a container ship, with its stacked containers, occupies the bottom half of the frame in the foreground, creating a symmetrical V-shape that directs the viewer's gaze toward the center. The dark ocean fills the middle ground, stretching to a central horizon line. Above, the cloudy night sky dominates the top half of the frame in the background. Throughout the shot, clouds move rapidly across the sky in a time-lapse, and a bright, greenish-white light streaks horizontally through the upper-middle portion of the frame before fading. Watermarks are overlaid in the foreground on the right side of the screen.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a dramatic maritime scenery shot, captured in a time-lapse from the bow of a massive container ship navigating the open ocean at night. The perspective looks out over stacks of colorful shipping containers toward the dark, expansive sea under a cloudy, star-dusted sky. As the clouds scud rapidly overhead, distant lights glimmer on the horizon, and as the ship advances, a golden light can be seen passing by, along with several green and white luminous objects. The composition emphasizes the immense scale of the environment and the solitary feeling of being at sea. The vastness of the ocean and the dynamic sky are the true focus, rather than any single object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high vantage point on a massive container ship at sea, this time-lapse video captures a nighttime journey. The camera looks forward over rows of colorful shipping containers stacked on the deck. The vast, dark ocean stretches out to the horizon under a cloudy night sky where faint stars are visible. As the ship moves forward, clouds drift rapidly overhead, and a golden-yellow light object passes by, accompanied by several green and white luminous objects. Overlaying the right side of the scene are watermarks for the social media handles 'JEFFREY.HK' and 'JEFFHK'.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains several inaccuracies. First, the \"level-angle perspective\" is incorrect; the camera is positioned high on the ship, looking down on the deck and out at the sea, making it a high-angle shot. Second, the description refers to \"The bow of a container ship,\" but the view is from a high point on the ship looking forward over the container-laden deck, not a view of the bow itself. This should be corrected to \"The deck of a container ship.\" Finally, the description of the moving lights is factually wrong. Instead of \"a golden object along with several green and white objects streak horizontally,\" it should state that \"a bright, greenish-white object streaks horizontally across the middle of the frame,\" as there is only one prominent streaking object of that color. The stationary light on the ship's bridge is golden but does not move.",
