    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot of a brightly lit menu board, occupying most of the frame. This board is positioned centrally in the foreground, with its detailed text and images of skewered food items clearly visible. The camera is at the same level as the menu board. As the video progresses, the camera pans to the left, transitioning to a wide shot of a modern indoor walkway. The menu board moves out of the frame, revealing more of the environment. The walkway stretches into the background, with metal railings on the left side and a wall on the right. Two people are seen in the distance, walking towards a brightly lit area with signage. The camera remains at eye level throughout, capturing the spaciousness and contemporary design of the corridor. The transition from the initial close-up to the wide shot of the walkway is smooth, maintaining a consistent camera height relative to the subjects and surroundings.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a medium shot of a brightly lit digital display board showcasing various skewered food items, including vegetables and meats, arranged neatly on a tray. The board features text in Japanese, with a decorative design that includes images of the food. As the video progresses, the focus shifts to a modern indoor walkway with a sleek, minimalist design. The walkway has metal railings on the left and a wall on the right, illuminated by soft lighting. The spacious and contemporary setting is emphasized as the camera moves down the corridor towards a distant area with visible signage and storefronts.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a first-person POV, transitions from an indoor setting featuring a brightly lit menu display to a modern, sleek corridor. Initially, the focus is on a menu board showcasing various dishes, likely in a restaurant or food establishment, with text and images prominently displayed. The scene then shifts to a spacious, well-lit hallway with contemporary architectural elements, including metal railings and wooden accents. The corridor features a wall on the right and an escalator on the left, illuminated by soft, ambient lighting. Overlay elements include a watermark reading \"VIRTUAL JAPAN.TV\" in the lower corners, which is not part of the scene itself.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects disappearing from the frame**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subject. Then the subject disappears.\n\nBefore the subject disappears, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on this caption. It is highly accurate, comprehensive, and adheres closely to all the instructions provided.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description of the events is spot-on. It correctly identifies the initial subject (menu board), the camera movement (pan left), and the final scene (walkway with people). The spatial positioning of all elements (menu, railings, wall, people) is described accurately in both 2D and 3D terms.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is very thorough. It successfully covers all the required aspects:\n    *   **Shot Size:** It correctly identifies the initial shot as a medium shot and the final shot as a wide shot.\n    *   **Position:** It effectively uses terms like \"centrally,\" \"foreground,\" \"left side,\" \"right side,\" and \"in the distance\" to map out the scene.\n    *   **Depth:** The description of the walkway \"stretching into the background\" clearly conveys the sense of depth in the final shot.\n    *   **Height:** It correctly notes the consistent eye-level camera height.\n    *   **Changes/Dynamics:** The transition is well-described as a \"pan to the left,\" with the menu board moving out of frame to reveal the walkway.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   The caption is a single, coherent paragraph.\n    *   It avoids speculation and overly subjective language, using factual descriptors like \"brightly lit\" and \"metal railings.\"\n    *   It focuses entirely on the spatial framing and dynamics as requested.\n    *   The language is clear, natural, and concise.\n\n**Minor Point for Improvement:**\n\n*   There is a very minor inconsistency where the initial shot is called a \"medium shot\" at the beginning and a \"close-up\" in the final sentence. While both are plausible terms for the shot, using one consistently would make the description even more precise. However, this is a trivial point in an otherwise outstanding caption.\n\nOverall, this is an exemplary caption that perfectly fulfills the requirements of the prompt.",
