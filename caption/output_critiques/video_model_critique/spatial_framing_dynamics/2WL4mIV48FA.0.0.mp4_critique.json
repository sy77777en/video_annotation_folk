    "pre_caption": "From a fixed point-of-view shot positioned above and behind the driver, the front half of the race car and the driver's cockpit occupy the bottom half of the frame in the foreground. The paved racetrack extends from the immediate foreground, running up the center of the frame into the middle and background. On the left and right sides of the track, rolling green hills stretch from the middle ground to the background, with an overcast sky filling the top of the frame. As the car accelerates forward, the track and scenery rush toward the camera. The car begins to climb a steep incline, causing the horizon line and a small white building in the distant background to move down in the frame as the car ascends the hill.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video provides a locked-on POV shot from a race car, focusing on the vehicle and its driver. The car is an open-wheel, formula-style racer with a light blue and silver body. The front wheels and suspension are exposed. On the blue section of the car's body, in front of the cockpit, the words \"GoPro\" and \"Be a HERO.\" are written in white. The driver is seated in the open cockpit, wearing a white racing suit with red and black wristbands, black gloves, and a black helmet that covers their entire head. Their hands are visible on the steering wheel.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot, with the camera mounted behind the driver of a light blue, open-wheel race car, captures a high-speed drive on a paved racetrack. The car, which has \"GoPro\" and \"Be a HERO.\" written in white on its body, speeds along the asphalt track, which features curves and significant elevation changes. The surrounding environment consists of rolling green hills under an overcast, cloudy sky. In the distance, a small white building with a flagpole is visible at the crest of a hill, and the race car gradually approaches this building. The driver, wearing a white racing suit and a black helmet, can be seen in the cockpit navigating the course.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera is mounted on the race car, filming the driver from an angle above them, with both the driver and the car roughly half visible, along with a wide shot of the scenery.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately describes the overall scene and camera perspective. However, there are a few areas for improvement in precision and completeness. First, the description of the building's movement is spatially inaccurate; stating it moves \"to the middle ground\" is incorrect, as its 3D depth does not change. It should be corrected to state that the building \"shifts downwards within the frame\" to accurately describe the change in its 2D position. Second, the caption omits the orange cones that are briefly visible on the left side of the track in the middle ground. Finally, the phrase \"sometimes passing by the foreground when the car is near the side\" is slightly awkward and can be removed for better clarity and conciseness, as the primary location of the hills is already established in the middle and background.",
