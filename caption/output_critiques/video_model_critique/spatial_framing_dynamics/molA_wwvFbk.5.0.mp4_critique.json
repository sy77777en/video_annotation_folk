    "pre_caption": "The shot opens with a complex, abstract pattern of red, pink, and white light streaks radiating from the center of the frame. The camera appears to move forward into this pattern, which resolves into a tunnel-like structure. This tunnel is defined by vertical and horizontal lines of red and orange light that rush from the background, through the middle ground, and past the camera in the foreground, creating a strong sense of forward motion and depth. The center of the frame consistently acts as a vanishing point in the deep background. The camera maintains a central, eye-level position, looking directly down the axis of this light tunnel throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features an abstract and dynamic display of vibrant colors and light patterns. It includes bright red, purple, and green streaks and beams that intersect and radiate from a central point, creating a sense of movement and energy. The colors blend and shift, with some areas appearing more intense and others more diffused. The overall composition is a kaleidoscope of light, with no discernible objects or figures, emphasizing a visually striking and immersive experience.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a dynamic and abstract scene filled with vibrant colors and light patterns. It features a kaleidoscope of bright red, purple, and orange hues, creating a sense of motion and energy. The environment is undefined, with no discernible natural or architectural elements, focusing instead on the interplay of light and color. The scene transitions smoothly, with streaks of light and color shifting and blending, suggesting movement through a tunnel of light. The overall atmosphere is immersive and visually striking, with a focus on the vivid and fluid visual elements.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is generally accurate but can be improved for precision and conciseness. The initial \"complex, abstract pattern\" can be more specifically described as \"cross-shaped,\" as the light streaks are organized along strong horizontal and vertical axes. Additionally, the tunnel's structure is described as being defined by \"vertical lines,\" but it also clearly features horizontal elements, making \"grid-like patterns\" a more accurate description. Finally, the phrase \"creating a strong sense of forward motion and depth\" is an interpretation of the effect and is redundant, as the description of elements rushing from the background to the foreground already conveys this information. Removing it would make the caption more concise and strictly descriptive.",
