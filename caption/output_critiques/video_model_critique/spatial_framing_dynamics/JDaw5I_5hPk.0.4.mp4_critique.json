    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot, a seagull is initially positioned in the center of the frame and in the foreground, descending towards the bottom. The middle ground is occupied by the sea, and a cliff is visible in the background at the top of the frame. The seagull lands on a rock located in the bottom center foreground. It then stands on the rock, remaining in the bottom center of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A seagull with a white body and head, grey wings with black tips, and a yellow beak with a red spot is shown landing on a dark rock. Its pinkish-red legs are extended downwards as it comes in for a landing. After touching down, it stands on the rock with its wings partially spread.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **At dusk, a seagull with white and grey plumage lands on a dark rock in the foreground. Its wings are spread as it touches down. In the background, the dark blue sea is choppy with white-crested waves, and a shadowy cliff face is visible on the horizon under a pale sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The description of the shot size as a \"wide shot\" is inaccurate; a \"medium-wide shot\" is more appropriate as the seagull is a prominent subject. The most significant error is the claim that \"the camera tracks the seagull after it lands.\" The camera is static throughout the entire shot; it is the seagull that moves within the fixed frame. Consequently, the phrase \"As the camera tracks the seagull after it lands\" should be removed and the sentence rephrased to describe the bird's action within the static frame. Finally, the description of the bird's final position as the \"center of the frame\" is imprecise; it remains in the \"bottom center\" after landing.",
