    "pre_caption": "The video maintains a full shot of a hand-drawn, fox-like creature within a white space defined by a gray grid floor. The scene opens with the creature, curled into a ball, positioned in the center-right of the frame and floating in the middle ground. It unfurls and moves diagonally up and to the left while holding a rotor-like object, leaving a trail of sketched, bubble-like shapes that drift toward the bottom right. The creature then descends diagonally back toward the center-right, landing in the foreground on the grid. The camera remains static throughout, positioned at a height that captures the action above the floor.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A black-and-white, hand-drawn, animated fox-like creature is depicted. Initially, it is curled into a circular ball shape. As it unfurls, it reveals a slender body, a long, bushy tail, pointed ears, and black paws. The creature is shown holding two small oval blades connected to a long, thin stick, resembling a helicopter rotor in function.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This black-and-white, hand-drawn animation is set within a stark white, undefined space. The only feature of the environment is a light gray perspective grid that establishes a floor plane. A stylized, fox-like creature, initially curled into a circular shape, unfurls and moves through the air while holding a rotor-like object. As it unfolds, a trail of small, sketched, bubble-like shapes appears and disappears as it lands on the gridded surface.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows unknown of the subjects.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions, here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption.\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is largely accurate in its description of the shot size, subject, setting, and camera properties. However, it contains significant inaccuracies regarding the subject's movement.\n    *   **Incorrect Movement Direction:** The caption states the creature \"moves diagonally up and to the left.\" In the video, the creature is clearly descending (moving down), not up. The rotor-like object is slowing its fall as it moves from the right side of the frame toward the left.\n    *   **Inaccurate Landing Trajectory:** The caption says the creature \"descends diagonally back toward the center-right, landing in the foreground.\" This misrepresents the action. The creature's descent path is from the upper-right to the mid-left of the frame. It lands on the left side and then tumbles/skids across the floor to a final resting position in the center-right foreground. The caption conflates the aerial descent with the ground-level tumble into a single, incorrect trajectory.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption successfully covers most of the required elements: shot size (full shot), 2D/3D position (center-right, middle ground to foreground), camera state (static), and relative height. However, its incomplete and inaccurate description of the spatial dynamics (the movement path) is a major flaw.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows the structural and stylistic rules well. It is a single, concise paragraph, uses objective and simple language, avoids speculation, and correctly identifies the key spatial framing elements. The primary failure is in accurately describing the *changes* in spatial position, as the description of the movement path is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is well-structured and follows the formatting guidelines, but its core description of the action is factually wrong. The misrepresentation of the creature's movement from \"up and to the left\" and the conflation of its descent and landing trajectories make the caption an inaccurate summary of the video's spatial dynamics.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video maintains a full shot of a hand-drawn, fox-like creature within a white space defined by a gray grid floor. The scene opens with the creature, curled into a ball, positioned in the upper-right of the frame and floating in the middle ground. It unfurls and descends diagonally toward the lower-left, its fall slowed by a rotor-like object it holds, leaving a trail of sketched, bubble-like shapes that drift toward the bottom right. The creature lands on the left side of the grid in the foreground and then tumbles across the floor, coming to rest in the center-right. The camera remains static throughout, positioned at a height that captures the action above the floor.",
