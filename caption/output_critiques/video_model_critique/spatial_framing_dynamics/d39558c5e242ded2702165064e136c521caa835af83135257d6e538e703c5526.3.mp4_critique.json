    "pre_caption": "This video opens with a medium shot, positioning a boy left of center in the middle ground and a girl to his right. In the foreground, a table displays a large red flask on the bottom left, a small bottle of pink dye near the center, and an open book on the right. The background features a chalkboard on the left, a skeleton model in the center-right, and a cactus on the far right. As the boy lifts and examines a flask of pink liquid, the camera dollies in, transitioning to a medium close-up that frames him from the chest up and places him centrally in the shot, while the girl on the right is pushed mostly out of view. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An East Asian boy and a Caucasian girl are shown at a table. The boy, standing and positioned slightly to the left of center, has short black hair and wears clear safety goggles over his eyes. He is dressed in a white, short-sleeved, button-up shirt covered in black cursive writing and has a white disposable glove on his right hand. He holds a glass volumetric flask containing a vibrant pink liquid, which he observes intently before picking it up and shaking it. To his right, a girl with blonde hair and fair skin sits at the table. She is wearing a blue and white plaid shirt and is seen resting her chin on her left hand while looking down at an open book, holding a pencil in her right hand. The scene transitions from a medium shot including both children to a closer view focusing on the boy from the chest up as he continues to inspect the flask.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place in a brightly lit indoor room set up like a science classroom. The background features a white wall adorned with a model of a human skeleton, various scientific diagrams, yellow sticky notes, and a tall green cactus. To the left, a black chalkboard rests on an easel. In the foreground, a white table is arranged with chemistry equipment, including a large, round-bottom glass flask containing a red liquid, a small bottle of pink dye, an open book, and a glass of water. A boy wearing safety goggles stands at the table, holding and swirling a glass conical flask filled with a vibrant pink liquid. To the right of the boy, a little girl with her hand resting on her cheek holds a pen and reads a book. The camera uses a dolly movement to move in, focusing on the boy and the flask he is examining.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video starts with a medium shot of a boy holding a glass bottle with purple liquid while a girl on the right does homework. As the boy lifts the bottle, the camera moves closer, showing only the boy’s body above his chest.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
