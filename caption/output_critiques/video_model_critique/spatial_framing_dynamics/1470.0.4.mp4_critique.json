    "pre_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of a person with short, straight brown hair, viewed from behind. The subject occupies the central portion of the frame, with their upper body and head filling most of the shot. Positioned in the foreground, the person faces a closed door located directly in front of them, which is situated in the middle ground. The door spans the width of the frame, with its smooth, panelled surface occupying the central and right portions. The person raises their left hand, moving it towards the door to knock. This action occurs in the upper left quadrant of the frame, indicating a slight shift in the subject's arm position. The camera maintains a steady angle at the subject's height throughout, capturing the interaction between the person and the door without any noticeable changes in shot size or perspective. The overall spatial framing focuses on the subject's back and the door, emphasizing the knocking gesture.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a person with medium-length, straight brown-red hair, seen from behind. They are wearing a white collared shirt. In one part of the video, the person raises their left hand, appearing to knock on a surface. The focus is on the back of the person, with no facial features visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an outdoor setting in front of a closed door, likely part of a residential building. The scene is captured during the day, with natural light illuminating the area. The door is a neutral color, possibly beige or light gray, with a smooth surface and subtle paneling. A person is present, facing the door, wearing a white shirt. The individual's hair is short and dark with reddish-brown tones. The environment is calm, with the person actively knocking on the door, adding a sense of motion to the scene. The focus remains on the interaction with the door.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "**Feedback on the Caption:**\n\nThe provided caption is excellent and adheres very well to the instructions. It is accurate, detailed, and written in a clear, objective style.\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the shot size as a close-up, the subject's position as central and in the foreground, and the door's position in the middle ground. The description of the knocking action with the left hand in the upper left quadrant is also precise.\n*   **Completeness:** The caption successfully covers all the required aspects: shot size, 2D and 3D positioning of the subject and key elements, camera height, and the dynamics of the movement. It provides a comprehensive spatial analysis of the short scene.\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   It correctly follows the structure by starting with the shot size and then detailing the spatial arrangement and movement.\n    *   It uses simple, natural English and avoids subjective or emotional language (e.g., \"smooth, panelled surface\" is descriptive, not emotional).\n    *   It avoids speculation and sticks to what is visually present in the frame.\n    *   The final sentence effectively summarizes the overall spatial focus of the shot.\n    *   The format is a single, coherent paragraph as requested.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is a perfect example of how to follow the given instructions. It provides a thorough and precise spatial description of the video content without any significant errors or omissions. No improvements are necessary.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A close-up shot, filmed from behind, shows a person with a short, reddish-brown bob haircut. The subject is positioned in the foreground, with their head and upper back occupying the center of the frame. They are facing a white, panelled door that fills the middle ground and background. The person is actively knocking on the door with their right fist, an action that occurs in the upper-central portion of the frame. The camera remains stationary at the subject's head level, maintaining a consistent perspective on the interaction. The tight framing on the person's back and the door creates a focused composition that emphasizes the gesture of knocking.",
