    "pre_caption": "This full shot captures a dynamic scene. On the left, a person in a pigeon costume is in the middle ground, blurred to indicate rapid movement towards the right and slightly into the foreground. A large green trash bin is situated in the center-right foreground, its lid ajar. To the right, another person wearing a yellow vest is in the foreground, partially obscured by the bin. The paved ground extends from the foreground to the middle ground. Indistinct city buildings and water form the distant background across the upper frame, beneath a clear sky at the top. The overall image exhibits motion blur, particularly on the pigeon-costumed person and in the streaking of the background, enhancing the sense of movement. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person in a full-body grey pigeon costume, featuring an orange beak, orange eyes, grey pants, and bright red shoes, is positioned on the left. As the camera pans right and slightly tilts down, it reveals another person on the right, wearing a bright yellow high-visibility vest over a dark grey short-sleeved shirt, bent over a large, open, green wheeled trash bin with their head obscured by the bin.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene unfolds outdoors on a paved, grey surface under a bright, clear blue sky, suggesting daytime. In the background, indistinct city buildings and a body of water are visible. A large, bright green, plastic wheeled trash bin with its lid ajar is prominent in the foreground. To the left, a figure in a grey bird costume with an orange beak and red shoes is in motion, appearing to wave a skateboard as if to strike the lid of the trash bin, casting a long, dark shadow. To the right, another figure wearing a bright yellow, reflective safety vest is partially obscured by the trash bin. The overall visual has a slightly blurred, dynamic quality.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly identifies the object held by the person in the pigeon costume as a \"skateboard.\" Due to the significant motion blur, the object is unidentifiable, and this speculative detail should be removed to adhere to the instruction to \"Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain.\" Additionally, the description of motion blur is mentioned redundantly. The phrase \"blurred to indicate rapid movement\" in the second sentence should be removed, as the motion blur affecting the entire scene is described more comprehensively in a later sentence. Consolidating these points would make the description more concise and accurate.",
