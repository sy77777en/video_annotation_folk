    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a man in the center foreground, framed by the interior of an aircraft on the left and right. The landscape and clouds are visible in the background. He then jumps out of the aircraft, and the shot transitions to an extreme wide shot captured from a high angle, looking down at him. In this new framing, the man is a smaller figure in the center middle ground, with his arms outstretched, set against the vast background of the ground far below and clouds scattered across the sky.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man is shown preparing to skydive from an aircraft. He wears a white, black, and red long-sleeved jumpsuit with Red Bull branding on the chest and sleeves, over which he has a black parachute harness. On his head, he wears a yellow helmet with red and blue Red Bull logos and a small camera mounted on top. He also wears white-framed sunglasses under a clear visor. Initially, he is inside the aircraft, holding onto the door frame and looking at the camera. He then jumps out, extending his arms to his sides in a stable freefall position.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From high above the ground, a skydiver exits an aircraft into a bright, sunny sky filled with large, white, puffy clouds. Below, a sprawling landscape unfolds, marked by a grid of roads and buildings interspersed with patches of brown and green terrain. In the distance, a body of water is visible on the horizon under the clear blue sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to an extreme wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately describes the initial and final framing of the man. However, it inaccurately implies a shot transition (\"the shot transitions to... In this new framing...\") when the video shows a single, continuous shot. The change in framing from a medium shot to an extreme wide shot is caused by the man jumping and moving away from the static camera, not by a cut or camera zoom. The description should be revised to reflect this continuous movement, explaining that as the man falls away from the camera, the shot size changes dynamically and his position recedes from the foreground to the middle ground within the same take. Additionally, the caption could mention that the camera's height relative to the subject changes from being at his level to a high angle looking down as he descends.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video is a single, continuous shot from a camera inside an aircraft. It starts as a medium shot of a man in the center foreground, framed by the plane's open door. He then jumps out, and as he falls away from the static camera, the shot dynamically widens into an extreme wide shot. The camera's perspective also changes from being at his level to a high angle looking down on him. He recedes from the foreground to become a smaller figure in the middle ground, with his arms outstretched against the vast landscape and clouds below.",
