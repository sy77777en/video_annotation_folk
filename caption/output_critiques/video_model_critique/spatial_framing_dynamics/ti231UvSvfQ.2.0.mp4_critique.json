    "pre_caption": "A close-up shot initially frames a young man's hands and arms in the foreground, positioned in the center as he draws on a desk. To the right in the foreground are various office supplies. The camera then performs a slow tilt-up and slight pan to the left, shifting the focus to a close-up of the man's face in profile, which now occupies the left side of the frame. Throughout this movement, other people at their workstations remain visible in the out-of-focus middle ground and background, primarily on the right side of the scene. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young, light-skinned man with short, blond hair is shown in profile, sitting at a desk and concentrating on his work. He is wearing a blue, long-sleeved sweatshirt over a white t-shirt. He uses a ruler and a pen to draw on a piece of paper. In the out-of-focus background, another man stands near a different desk; he is wearing a grey vest over a light-colored shirt and grey pants. Other indistinct figures are also visible in the background, some of whom are seated.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place in a functional, office-like environment with a desaturated, cool-toned color palette. In the foreground, a person sits at a wooden desk, using a ruler and pen to work on a drawing. The desk is cluttered with various supplies, including a notebook, a roll of tape, a red stapler, and a cup holding pens. The background, which is slightly out of focus, shows other people at their workstations, with multiple computer monitors and simple office furniture visible.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

While the action of drawing occurs in the right half of the frame, his arms extend from his body, which is positioned on the left.
