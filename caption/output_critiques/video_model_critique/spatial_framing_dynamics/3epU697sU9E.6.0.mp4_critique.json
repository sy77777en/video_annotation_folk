    "pre_caption": "This is a static, straight-on shot of a 2D graphical overlay against a black background. A white horizontal timeline is positioned across the center of the frame, with white numerical timestamps located directly above it. A short, glowing red vertical line is situated on the central timeline. This red line moves at a slow, steady pace horizontally from left to right, starting just before the \"10:12\" timestamp and continuing past it. The entire composition is flat, lacking any discernible depth.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a horizontal timeline against a black background, marked with white lines and time stamps at regular intervals, such as 10:05, 10:10, 10:15, 10:20, and 10:25, with additional timestamps at 10:12 and 10:18. A short red vertical line moves to the right, representing the passage of time, and is currently approaching and passing the 10:12 mark. The design is minimalistic, focusing on the linear progression of time, with the red line serving as a dynamic visual indicator of significance or emphasis within the sequence.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Against a solid black background, an overlay of a horizontal white timeline is displayed across the center. The timeline features small vertical tick marks, with larger ones labeled in a white, digital-style font at five-minute intervals, including 10:05, 10:10, 10:15, 10:20, and 10:25. A slightly glowing vertical red bar moves slowly to the right along the timeline, indicating the passage of time. The text for 10:12 and 10:18 is slightly larger than the other times, but the tick marks remain standard. The entire visual, including the timeline and text, is a graphical overlay.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

  "generated_critique": "**Feedback on the Caption:**\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is perfectly accurate. It correctly identifies all the visual elements—the timeline, timestamps, and the moving red line—and accurately describes their appearance, color, and positioning. The description of the red line's movement as slow, steady, and horizontal from left to right is also precise.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is comprehensive. It covers the static background elements, the single moving element, their spatial relationships within the frame, the camera's perspective, and the overall visual style (2D graphic). It successfully captures all the essential visual information in the clip.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows the instructions flawlessly.\n    *   **Shot Size/Framing:** It correctly identifies the nature of the shot (\"static, straight-on shot of a 2D graphical overlay\").\n    *   **Spatial Position (2D/3D):** It clearly defines the 2D positions (\"across the center,\" \"directly above\") and correctly notes the lack of 3D depth (\"The entire composition is flat, lacking any discernible depth\").\n    *   **Camera Height:** It addresses this with the term \"straight-on shot.\"\n    *   **Movement:** It provides a clear and detailed description of the red line's spatial movement.\n    *   **Formatting and Tone:** The caption is a single, coherent paragraph, uses simple and objective language, and avoids speculation or subjective adjectives, as instructed.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is excellent. It is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions, resulting in a description that is accurate, detailed, and perfectly aligned with the user's request. No improvements are necessary.",
