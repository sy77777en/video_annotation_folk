    "pre_caption": "The shot begins with a red humanoid figure in the bottom left foreground, initially in sharp focus, while a large crowd on bleachers in the middle ground and background remains blurred. The focus then racks from the foreground to the background, causing the red figure to become out of focus. Simultaneously, the crowd of white and grey figures comes into sharp focus, revealing they are seated on large bleachers that occupy the center of the frame and standing in formation on the ground in the middle ground. The camera's position remains static throughout this transition.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video initially focuses on a stylized, glossy red humanoid figure lying on its side in the foreground on the lower left. The focus then shifts to the background, revealing a large crowd of indistinct, white and grey humanoid figures. This crowd is assembled in a stadium-like setting, with many figures seated in rows on bleachers and others standing in formation on the ground in front of them. The figures in the crowd are uniform in appearance, lacking individual details.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a stark, monochromatic outdoor setting resembling a stadium, large bleachers are filled with a crowd of indistinct white figures. The background features simple, gray architectural structures and trees against a white ground. The only point of color is a single, stylized human figure in the foreground, rendered in bright red and positioned low to the ground. Overlay text \"[8]\" is located in the bottom left corner.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex change of subject shot. It begins with a red humanoid character lying on the ground in the foreground, occupying 20% of the frame's height on the left side, with the background blurred. The focus then shifts to a large group of humanoid characters in the distant background, suggesting a rally.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: It appears to be a 2D video, making it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly states that the red humanoid figure is \"initially in sharp focus.\" At the beginning of the video, the focus is on the foreground where the figure is located, but the figure itself is blurry and not sharp. The description should be corrected to state that the focus is initially on the foreground, making the background blurred. Additionally, the caption is missing the shot size and the camera's height. It should specify that this is a wide shot and that the camera is positioned at a slightly elevated angle relative to the scene.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This wide shot, filmed from a slightly elevated angle, begins with a blurry red humanoid figure in the bottom left foreground. Initially, the focus is on the foreground, rendering the large crowd on bleachers in the middle ground and background out of focus. The focus then racks from the foreground to the background, causing the red figure to become more blurred while the crowd of white and grey figures comes into sharp focus. This reveals they are seated on large bleachers that occupy the center of the frame and standing in formation on the ground in the middle ground. The camera's position remains static throughout this transition.",
