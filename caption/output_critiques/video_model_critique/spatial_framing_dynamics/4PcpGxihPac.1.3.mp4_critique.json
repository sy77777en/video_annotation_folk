    "pre_caption": "This video begins with a wide shot of a person positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground, surrounded by tree trunks and undergrowth in the background. A prominent horizontal red lens flare with circular bokeh effects is situated in the foreground, stretching across the middle of the frame. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, slowly zooms in on the person. This movement causes the shot to tighten, making the person's head the primary focus as it grows larger in the frame, transitioning the shot towards a medium close-up.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a person, whose gender is not discernible, centered in a dark, wooded environment saturated with intense red light. This individual has a pale face and is positioned among tree trunks and branches, aiming a gun forward. A bright red horizontal lens flare crosses the middle of the scene. Throughout the shot, the camera slowly zooms in, making the person's head the primary focus and appear larger in the frame.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A dark, wooded area at night is completely saturated in a deep red light. A bright, horizontal red lens flare with several circular bokeh effects stretches across the center of the view. In the background, the silhouettes of tree trunks and undergrowth are faintly discernible. A pale, mask-like face is partially visible in the center, nestled amongst the trees and obscured by the intense red haze.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This video begins with a wide shot of a person centered in the frame, aiming a gun. The camera, positioned in front of them, focuses on their head. As the camera zooms in, the person appears larger in the frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "**Feedback on the Caption:**\n\nThe provided caption is excellent and adheres closely to all instructions. It is accurate, complete, and well-structured.\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the person in the center/middle ground, the surrounding trees/undergrowth in the background, and the prominent red lens flare in the foreground. The description of the camera movement (slow zoom) and its effect on the shot (tightening from a wider shot to a medium close-up) is precise.\n*   **Completeness:** The caption successfully covers all the required elements:\n    *   **Shot Size:** It correctly identifies the initial shot size (\"wide shot,\" which is a reasonable interpretation) and the transition to a \"medium close-up.\"\n    *   **Spatial Position:** It effectively uses 2D (center, middle of the frame) and 3D (foreground, middle ground, background) terminology to place the subject and the lens flare.\n    *   **Camera Height & Movement:** It accurately notes the camera is at the subject's level and describes the slow zoom-in.\n    *   **Dynamics:** The description of the shot tightening and the subject's head becoming the focus perfectly captures the spatial dynamics of the scene.\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows the guidelines perfectly. It is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English. It avoids subjective or emotional language and speculative statements, focusing purely on the objective visual information.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThis is a model caption that effectively translates the visual composition and movement of the video into a clear, objective description. It demonstrates a strong understanding of all the required analytical points. No corrections are needed.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video opens on a medium shot of a person positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground, surrounded by trees and undergrowth in the background. A prominent horizontal red lens flare with circular bokeh effects occupies the foreground, stretching across the middle of the image. The camera, positioned at the subject's eye level, slowly zooms in, causing the shot to tighten. This movement transitions the framing into a medium close-up, making the person's head the primary focus as it grows larger in the frame.",
