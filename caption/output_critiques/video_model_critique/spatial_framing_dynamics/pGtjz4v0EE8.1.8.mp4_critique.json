    "pre_caption": "The video features a wide shot of an ornate gallery interior, emphasizing the grandeur and artistic details of the architecture. The camera moves forward through the hall, maintaining a central position, with the barrel-vaulted ceiling and its intricate frescoes prominently displayed in the top center of the frame. The walls, lined with decorative panels and paintings, are positioned on the left and right, creating a symmetrical composition. Large windows on the left allow natural light to illuminate the scene, enhancing the visibility of the polished stone floors in the foreground. Visitors are scattered throughout the middle ground, adding scale and activity to the scene. The camera is positioned at eye level, providing a first-person perspective that enhances the immersive experience.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This interior scenery shot captures a walkthrough of a magnificent and ornate gallery. As the camera moves forward down the long hall, it showcases a spectacular barrel-vaulted ceiling covered in intricate frescoes with gold and blue accents. The walls are lined with decorative panels and paintings, while bright light streams in from large windows along one side. Numerous visitors exploring the hall enhance the sense of scale and contribute to the lively atmosphere of this historic public space. The primary focus remains on the grandeur and artistic detail of the architecture. The use of a wide-angle lens further emphasizes the immersive quality and vastness of the hall.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, exploring an opulent indoor setting, likely a historic museum or gallery. The environment is richly decorated, featuring high, ornate ceilings adorned with intricate frescoes and gold accents. The walls are lined with detailed artwork and decorative panels, contributing to the grandeur of the space. Large windows allow natural light to flood the room, highlighting the polished stone floors and the elegant architectural details. Visitors are scattered throughout, some observing the art, adding a sense of scale and activity. The atmosphere is serene and contemplative, with the focus on the artistic and architectural elements. Black vignettes are placed around the edges of the frame, subtly enhancing the immersive experience without detracting from the visual focus.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption fails to mention the most significant aspect of the video's spatial framing: the use of a fisheye or extreme wide-angle lens. This omission leads to an inaccurate description of the scene's geometry. The caption states the walls create a \"symmetrical composition,\" but the lens distorts all straight lines, making the walls and the barrel-vaulted ceiling appear to curve dramatically inward, which is a key element of the spatial framing. Additionally, the caption uses subjective and interpretive language such as \"emphasizing the grandeur,\" \"enhancing the overall... ambiance,\" and \"enhances the immersive experience,\" which should be removed in favor of more objective descriptions. The description of the windows' effect should be simplified to state that they illuminate the hall, and the description of the camera's perspective should be limited to \"providing a first-person perspective.\"",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "Shot with a fisheye or extreme wide-angle lens, the video provides a forward-moving, first-person perspective through an ornate gallery.
