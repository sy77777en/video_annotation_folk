    "pre_caption": "This wide shot captures a street corner scene. In the left foreground, two vending machines stand against a stone-walled building. Adjacent to them, in the center-left foreground, several bicycles are parked next to a utility pole. This pole, positioned in the center foreground/middle ground, features a pedestrian traffic light above a no-parking sign. The street occupies the bottom foreground, curving towards the right middle ground between residential houses. A silver SUV is visible parked in a driveway in the center-right middle ground. Houses line the street in the middle ground and background. The camera is positioned at approximately eye level. During the shot, the camera moves slightly forward and pans slightly to the right, subtly shifting the perspective and bringing the elements slightly closer while revealing a little more of the street curving to the right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot. It captures a quiet urban street corner, focusing on the environment rather than a specific subject. The scene includes elements like a vending machine, bicycles, and residential buildings, emphasizing the everyday atmosphere of the neighborhood. The presence of a traffic light and a no-parking sign adds to the urban setting. The overall composition highlights the scale and layout of the street, creating a sense of place without focusing on any single object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, shows an outdoor street corner in a Japanese residential area, likely in the late afternoon or early evening. To the left, against a building with a light-brown, textured stone wall, stand two vending machines: one is red, and the other is white with a prominent \"100円\" sign, both filled with beverages. Several bicycles, including a pink one, are parked neatly in a designated space next to the white vending machine and a utility pole. This pole holds a pedestrian crossing signal displaying a red standing figure and a circular blue-and-red \"No Parking\" sign. An asphalt road with white painted markings occupies the foreground and curves away between houses typical of Japanese residential architecture. A silver SUV is parked in a driveway further down the street. Overhead utility wires crisscross the view. The video includes a slight shift forward and to the right.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work. The caption is a perfect example of how to follow the provided instructions. Here is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n### Feedback\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the shot size, all key elements (vending machines, bicycles, utility pole, signs, SUV, houses), their specific locations within the frame, and their depth. The description of the camera movement—a slight forward push and a pan to the right—and its effect on the scene is precise.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is comprehensive. It addresses every requirement from the instructions, including shot size, 2D position (left, center-right), 3D position (foreground, middle ground, background), camera height (eye level), and the dynamics of the shot. It successfully analyzes multiple elements within the scene, providing a full spatial picture.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Structure and Content:** The caption follows the specified structure perfectly, starting with the shot size, moving to the spatial arrangement of static elements, mentioning camera height, and concluding with the camera's movement.\n    *   **Language:** The language is simple, natural, and strictly objective, avoiding any subjective or speculative phrasing as instructed.\n    *   **Conciseness:** It is a single, well-formed paragraph that is both concise and rich with the required information.\n    *   **Formatting:** The output is correctly formatted as a single paragraph without any introductory text or markdown.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is outstanding. It demonstrates a complete understanding of the task, meticulously applying all rules to create a description that is accurate, detailed, and perfectly aligned with the prompt's focus on spatial framing and dynamics. There are no corrections or improvements needed.",
