    "pre_caption": "The video features a wide shot of a rally car speeding along a dirt road. Initially, the car is centered in the frame, occupying the middle ground, with a large cloud of dust trailing behind it. The car is positioned slightly off-center to the left, moving from the bottom left towards the top right of the frame. As the car progresses, the camera follows its movement, maintaining a consistent overhead angle. The surrounding landscape, consisting of sparse vegetation and distant hills, forms the background, while the dusty road occupies the foreground. The camera remains above the car throughout, capturing its dynamic motion and the expanding dust trail. The shot size and camera height remain constant, emphasizing the car's trajectory and the expansive desert environment. The road curves gently, and the car continues along this path, with the dust cloud growing larger as it moves further into the frame. The overall spatial framing highlights the car's central role and the vastness of the surrounding terrain.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a dark-colored rally car, either black or dark blue, driving at high speed on a dirt road, creating a large cloud of dust and smoke behind it. The car is sleek and aerodynamic, with visible racing decals and a spoiler. It navigates a winding path, suggesting dynamic movement and precision driving. The surrounding landscape is arid, with sparse vegetation and distant hills, emphasizing the car's motion and the dust trail it leaves. The scene captures the essence of a high-energy rally race in a desert-like environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from an overhead perspective, presents a view of a desert landscape with a primarily straight road that becomes winding towards the end. The setting is outdoors, featuring a dry, arid environment with sparse vegetation and distant rolling hills. The time of day appears to be daylight, with clear visibility and no significant weather conditions affecting the scene. A vehicle is prominently visible, moving along the road and leaving a trail of white smoke or dust behind it, creating dynamic motion across the barren terrain. The road is bordered by sandy, textured ground, emphasizing the vastness and openness of the desert setting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is inaccurate regarding the car's initial position and contains significant redundancy. The video begins with the car in the center of the frame, not \"slightly off-center to the right.\" The description of its movement as \"minor shifts\" is too vague; it should specify that the car drifts from the center toward the right side of the frame as it navigates a curve. The description of the dust cloud as \"trailing behind it\" is an understatement; the dust billows out to fill the entire foreground and lower half of the frame. Furthermore, the caption is repetitive, stating the camera is at an \"overhead angle\" and then that it \"remains above the car,\" and mentioning \"shifts in position\" twice. The final sentence is a redundant summary and should be removed to improve conciseness.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with a high-angle aerial shot following a rally car speeding along a dirt road. The car begins in the center of the frame, kicking up a massive cloud of white smoke and dust that billows out to fill the foreground and the lower half of the screen. As the car navigates a wide curve, it drifts toward the right side of the frame, with the camera tracking its movement from above. The surrounding landscape is a dry, desert environment with sparse vegetation and rolling hills in the background.",
