    "pre_caption": "The video presents an extreme wide shot of a basketball court, capturing the entire space from a high vantage point above the subjects. The main subject, a man in a dark athletic outfit, is initially positioned near the center of the frame in the middle ground, preparing to catch a basketball. As he catches the ball, he moves slightly forward toward the bottom center of the frame, still in the middle ground. Other individuals are scattered across the court and seating areas, primarily in the background and foreground, but they gradually disappear through a time-lapse effect. The basketball hoops are located at the top left and top right corners of the frame, in the background. The tiered seating surrounds the court, with red seats on the left side and green seats on the right, all in the background. The camera remains stationary throughout, maintaining a consistent overhead perspective that emphasizes the spaciousness of the court and the diminishing presence of other individuals. The lighting is bright and even, and Chinese text appears at the bottom of the frame. The main subject's movement is subtle, primarily involving a slight shift in position as he prepares to drive towards the basket.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a bustling basketball court filled with numerous people. As the main subject, a man in a dark athletic outfit, catches the basketball, many of the other individuals disappear in a time-lapse effect. As he prepares to drive towards the basket, more people vanish, ultimately leaving him alone on the court. The setting is slightly dim, creating a more intimate and focused atmosphere for his practice session.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows an indoor basketball court with wooden flooring and black painted key areas. The court is surrounded by tiered seating, mostly empty, with red and green sections. Basketball hoops with nets are at each end of the court. Several people are scattered around the court, some standing and others walking, but they gradually disappear due to a time-lapse effect, leaving only one person playing basketball at the end. The lighting is bright and even. Overlay text in Chinese, \"也不光靠训练,\" briefly appears in the lower left corner of the frame before disappearing.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good for this video. While it follows the structural and formatting instructions, it contains several significant factual inaccuracies that misrepresent the scene's spatial arrangement and action.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption fails on accuracy in several key areas:\n*   **Main Subject's Action:** The caption states the subject is \"preparing to catch a basketball\" and then \"catches the ball.\" In the video, the subject already has the ball at the start and is in a shooting stance. He then lowers the ball and begins to move.\n*   **Main Subject's Movement:** It incorrectly describes the subject moving \"toward the bottom center of the frame.\" The subject actually moves from the right side of the court toward the basket at the top right.\n*   **Disappearing People:** The claim that other individuals \"gradually disappear through a time-lapse effect\" is false. All individuals remain visible throughout the short clip; there is no time-lapse or disappearance effect.\n*   **Basketball Hoop Positions:** The description of the hoops is incorrect. It states they are at the \"top left and top right corners... in the background.\" In reality, one hoop is in the **bottom-left foreground**, and the other is in the **top-right background**. This is a critical error in describing the scene's depth and spatial layout.\n*   **Lighting:** The lighting is described as \"bright and even,\" which is inaccurate. The arena is dark, with the court itself being specifically illuminated by spotlights, creating high contrast rather than even brightness.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption attempts to be complete by mentioning shot size, positions, depth, and movement. However, because the information provided is largely incorrect, it fails to offer a complete and truthful account of the scene.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   The caption violates the instruction to \"Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain\" by inventing a \"time-lapse effect.\"\n*   While it uses the requested terminology (e.g., \"extreme wide shot,\" \"middle ground\"), the incorrect application of these terms to the scene's elements (like the hoops) undermines its adherence to the core goal of providing an accurate spatial description.\n*   The inclusion of a slightly interpretive phrase like \"emphasizes the spaciousness\" is a minor deviation from the instruction to avoid subjective language.\n\nIn summary, the caption is fundamentally flawed due to multiple major factual errors regarding the subjects' actions, movement, and the spatial positioning of key elements. It does not provide an accurate description of the video.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "An extreme wide shot from a high angle shows a basketball court inside a large, dimly lit arena. The court is illuminated by spotlights, creating a high contrast with the dark, tiered seating that surrounds it. In the middle ground on the right side of the court, a man in a dark athletic outfit holds a basketball, initially in a shooting stance. He then lowers the ball and begins to move toward the basketball hoop located in the top-right background. Another basketball hoop is positioned in the bottom-left foreground. Several other people are visible on the court and in the stands, remaining relatively stationary throughout the shot. The seating is red on the left and green on the right. The camera remains static, and Chinese text is present at the bottom of the frame.",
