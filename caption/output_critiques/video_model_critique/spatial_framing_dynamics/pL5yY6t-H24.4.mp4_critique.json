    "pre_caption": "A full shot captures a Flybe airplane in the middle ground, initially positioned in the center of the frame and angled away from the camera. In the bottom left foreground, a taxiway sign is visible, with houses and trees situated in the background. The airplane taxis from the right side of the frame toward the left. The camera pans left to follow the aircraft, keeping it in the center of the frame as it moves across the middle ground. Consequently, the taxiway sign in the foreground shifts from the bottom left toward the bottom center. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A white passenger airplane with Flybe livery is positioned on a paved runway, viewed from a rear three-quarter angle. The aircraft's tall, white tail fin is marked with a large, stylized \"be\" logo in dark blue. The rear of the fuselage features a pattern of wavy stripes in two shades of blue. The airline's name, \"flybe.\", is written in blue lowercase letters on the side of the plane, above the wing, with a small accent of yellow, orange, and red stripes beneath it. The plane has two jet engines mounted under its wings and is supported by its landing gear. In the grassy foreground, a taxiway sign is visible, consisting of a black square with \"A1\" in yellow text next to a red square with \"27\" in white text.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene at an airport shows a white passenger airplane taxiing on an asphalt runway under a clear blue sky. The plane, featuring blue and multi-colored livery with \"flybe\" written on its side, moves across the scene. In the foreground, a grassy area contains a taxiway sign, which includes a black square displaying \"A1\" in yellow text alongside a red square with \"27\" in white text. The background is composed of green trees and a row of houses with grey slate roofs and white walls, some of which have distinctive turret-like architectural features.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The description of the airplane's movement is inaccurate. The caption states the airplane taxis \"from the right side of the frame,\" but it actually begins in the center of the frame and moves toward the left. The phrase \"toward the left-front\" is also ambiguous and should be simplified to \"toward the left.\" Furthermore, while the caption correctly identifies a \"zoom-in,\" it fails to describe its effect on the spatial framing; the shot transitions from a full shot to a tighter full shot as the plane grows larger in the frame. The statement that the plane shifts to the left \"especially noticeable after the zoom-in\" is also misleading, as the zoom is gradual throughout the clip. This should be rephrased to describe the camera panning left and zooming in slightly as it tracks the aircraft's movement from the center toward the left of the frame.",
