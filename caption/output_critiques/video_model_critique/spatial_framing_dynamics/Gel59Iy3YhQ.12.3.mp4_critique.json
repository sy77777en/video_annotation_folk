    "pre_caption": "This is a static, high-angle medium shot of a damaged robot positioned centrally on the frame. The robot lies diagonally, with its upper section in the middle ground toward the top right and its lower mechanical limbs extending into the foreground toward the bottom left. A small, red light is visible on the left side of its central chassis, while a cluster of glowing cyan orbs is situated on its upper body in the upper right portion of the frame. The dark, gridded floor occupies the entire background and foreground, and the camera remains completely still throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dimly lit space, a damaged robot lies on a dark, gridded floor. Viewed from a high angle, its complex, skeletal structure is a tangle of dark metal components, wires, and tubes, with some sections covered in off-white plating. Two small, red lights glow below a white light, resembling eyes, on one part of its body. Meanwhile, some cyan lights are visible on different parts of the robot, embedded within a dark, lumpy, organic-looking substance.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, industrial setting, a complex mechanical figure lies broken on a floor of gridded metal panels. The scene is illuminated by a faint overhead light, creating deep shadows. The figure is a jumble of metallic struts, a central chassis, and numerous black wires and tubes snaking across the floor. Two small red lights glow on parts of the machine, while a cluster of pale, luminous blue-green orbs with a lumpy texture rests on another section. Dark stains are spattered on the floor around the inert structure.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
