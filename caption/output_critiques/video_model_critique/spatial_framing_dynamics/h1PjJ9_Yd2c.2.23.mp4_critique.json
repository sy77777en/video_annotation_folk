    "pre_caption": "The video begins with dark, out-of-focus elements in the bottom left and bottom right foreground, partially obscuring the view. A white door is visible in the middle ground, slightly right of center, with a young woman initially seen in the background through its opening, positioned centrally within the doorway. As she opens the door towards the right side of the frame and steps forward, the shot transitions to a medium shot of her. She moves from the background to the middle ground, occupying the center of the frame. The open door remains in the middle ground to the right, and its silver handle is on its left side from the viewer's perspective. When the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Initially partially obscured by a dark foreground element, a young woman with dark hair pulled back and a light skin tone is revealed as she opens a white door from the other side and steps forward. She is wearing a plain grey short-sleeved shirt. The door she is opening has a silver-colored handle.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors, in what appears to be an evenly lit room. A light-colored, possibly off-white, door is partially open, revealing a glimpse into another space. The door features a silver-colored, metallic lever-style handle. The walls visible are plain and light-toned. A person is visible through the doorway. The overall lighting is balanced, creating a calm atmosphere.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a medium shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains factual inaccuracies regarding the spatial dynamics of the door and the camera. The statement \"The open door, initially in the middle ground on the left, transitions to the middle ground on the right due to camera movements\" is incorrect. The door is consistently on the right side of the doorway from the viewer's perspective; it is not on the left. Furthermore, the change in framing is caused by the subject opening the door and moving forward, not by \"camera movements,\" as the camera appears to be static. The description of the handle's movement is also confusing and inaccurate. The sentence should be corrected to accurately describe that the door on the right side of the doorway is opened towards the right, and the subject moves from the background to the middle ground, changing the shot to a medium shot.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a view partially obscured by dark, out-of-focus foreground elements. A young woman is seen in the background, standing in a doorway. She opens the door panel, which is on the right side of the doorway, pulling it towards the right. As she steps forward through the opening, she moves from the background to the middle ground, and the shot transitions to a medium shot of her at eye level. She now occupies the center of the frame, with the open door to the right. The door's silver handle is on its left side.",
