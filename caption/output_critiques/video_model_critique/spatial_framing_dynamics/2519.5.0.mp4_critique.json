    "pre_caption": "This is a medium shot. A man occupies the center middle ground, positioned in front of a beam of light originating from the top right background. A complex mechanical device sits in the bottom center foreground. A yellow garment hangs in the left background. The man initially leans forward, striking the device in the foreground with a hammer. He then drops the hammer, briefly squats down, stands back up, and turns his head towards the left, remaining in the center middle ground. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man in a dimly lit setting with short, dark hair, wearing a dark jacket over a sweater with a collared shirt underneath. He is using a hammer to strike a complex mechanical device with visible wires and components. After removing a part of the device with the hammer, he drops it and searches through the machine. He then squats down, stands up, and turns his head angrily to his left, which is the right side of the frame. The lighting casts a beam on him, highlighting his profile and the device.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting with dim lighting, creating a shadowy and mysterious atmosphere. The environment appears to be a workshop or mechanical space, characterized by industrial elements. A beam of light cuts through the darkness, highlighting dust particles in the air. The walls are obscured, but a yellow garment hangs in the background, adding a splash of color. The scene includes machinery with visible wires and metal components, suggesting a focus on technical or mechanical work. The overall color palette is dark, with muted tones and subtle contrasts between light and shadow.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on your instructions, here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description of the initial spatial setup is highly accurate. The shot size, the positions of the man (center middle ground), the light (top right background), the mechanical device (bottom center foreground), and the yellow garment (left background) are all correctly identified.\n*   The description of the man's initial action (\"striking the device in the foreground with a hammer\") is a reasonable interpretation of the visible action.\n*   The description of the subsequent actions is inaccurate. The video does not show the man dropping the hammer, squatting, standing back up, or turning his head to the left. Instead, after striking with the tool, he makes a broad, sweeping motion with his arm from right to left across the table, knocking things over.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully covers all the required elements from the instructions: shot size, 2D and 3D positions of multiple subjects/elements, a description of movement, and the camera's height relative to the subject. It provides a good sense of the scene's composition and depth.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   The caption adheres well to the structural and stylistic guidelines. It is a single, coherent paragraph, uses simple and objective language, and avoids speculation or emotional adjectives. It correctly focuses on the spatial dynamics of the main subject. The only point of non-adherence is the factual inaccuracy of the action described in the latter half of the clip.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe caption is very good at describing the static composition of the scene but fails to accurately describe the key movement that occurs. The description of the man's actions after the initial strikes needs to be corrected to reflect the sweeping, destructive gesture shown in the video.",
