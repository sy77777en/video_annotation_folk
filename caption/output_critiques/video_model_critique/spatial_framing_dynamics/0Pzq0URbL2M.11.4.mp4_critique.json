    "pre_caption": "This is a full shot showing a group of men seated in a row at a long table. The row of men occupies the horizontal center of the frame, extending from the left towards the right edge, positioned in the middle ground. The table is directly in front of them, also in the middle ground and spanning the central width of the frame. The chairs are beneath the men, in the middle ground. The reflective floor occupies the bottom portion of the frame, mirroring the subjects. The background is a dimly lit, indistinct space behind the men. Initially, the camera is positioned slightly towards the left side of the row. Over the first few seconds, the camera slowly moves horizontally to the right, resulting in a more centered view of the entire row of men within the frame. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a group of men seated in a row at a long table. They are all wearing similar attire, consisting of light-colored shirts and pants. The men have varied hairstyles, with all of them having short hair. They are positioned closely together, facing the same direction, suggesting a sense of uniformity and focus. The lighting is dim, casting shadows that emphasize the collective presence of the group rather than individual features. The overall composition highlights the uniformity and alignment of the subjects.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting with a dimly lit, minimalist environment. A long, dark table extends across the scene, surrounded by a row of identical chairs. Seated at the table are multiple figures, all wearing similar attire, facing away from the viewer. Soft light is cast above the table, and the floor reflects the shadows of the row of people, emitting a faint sheen. The atmosphere is calm and still, with no visible movement or activity. Overlays include a small text element located at [25,28], which is not part of the scene itself.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "An evaluation of the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subjects as a group of men at a table and accurately describes their arrangement in a row. The description of the camera movement—a slow horizontal shift from left to right to center the group—is precise and matches the video's action perfectly. The details about the reflective floor and the indistinct background are also correct.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is very complete and follows the instructions thoroughly.\n*   **Shot Size:** It correctly identifies the shot as a \"full shot,\" which is appropriate for capturing the entire group and their immediate setting.\n*   **Spatial Position (2D & 3D):** It excels in this area, clearly defining the 2D position (horizontal center) and 3D depth (middle ground) for the men, table, and chairs. It also correctly places the reflective floor in the bottom portion of the frame and the background behind the subjects.\n*   **Camera Height:** It accurately notes that the camera is positioned at the subjects' level.\n*   **Spatial Dynamics:** It provides a clear and detailed description of the camera's initial position and its slow movement to a final, more centered position, fulfilling the requirement to describe any changes.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres strictly to all instructions. It is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English. It successfully avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language, focusing solely on objective spatial description. It covers all the required elements (shot size, position, depth, height, and movement) as requested.\n\n**Overall:** The caption is excellent. It is a precise, comprehensive, and well-structured description of the video's spatial framing and dynamics, perfectly aligning with all the given guidelines.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A full, eye-level shot shows a long row of men seated at a table, positioned in the middle ground across the horizontal center of the frame. A reflective floor in the foreground mirrors the scene, while the background is a dimly lit, indistinct space. The camera begins slightly offset to the left and slowly tracks to the right, eventually centering the entire group in the frame.",
