    "pre_caption": "This medium shot frames a man in military gear in the left foreground, who is partially out of focus. The main subject, a woman, is positioned in the middle ground, slightly right of the center, strongly backlit by a bright light originating from the background. In the right background, a helicopter and another soldier are visible. Subtitles are located at the bottom of the frame. The woman, initially facing the man, turns to her right and walks away, moving deeper into the background and toward the right side of the frame. The camera remains static and at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a middle-aged woman with dark hair styled in a bun, who is strongly backlit by a bright light. She wears a light-colored, button-up jacket over a darker shirt. She initially looks toward a man in the foreground before turning to her right and walking away. The man, positioned on the left and partially out of focus, has a thick, dark beard and is dressed in military gear, including a tactical vest and a dark beanie. In the background, another figure in military attire stands near a large vehicle.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This is an outdoor night scene set in a hazy or dusty environment. In the background, a large, dark helicopter is parked with its side door open. A powerful, bright white light emanates from behind a central figure, creating a strong backlight that fills the air with illuminated haze and casts long shadows. A faint red light is also visible on the side of the vehicle. A man wearing a dark beanie and tactical vest is partially visible in the foreground. A subtitle overlay is present at the bottom of the screen, with the name \"Price\" in green text and the dialogue \"I'll call you if I need you.\" in white text.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is missing a description of the camera's height relative to the subjects, which is a required element. The description of the camera movement, while accurate, could be slightly simplified for conciseness. The phrase \"who is partially out of focus\" can be integrated more smoothly.\n\nHere is a revised version for improvement:\nFilmed at eye-level, this medium shot frames a partially out-of-focus man in military gear in the left foreground. The main subject, a woman, is positioned in the center of the frame in the middle ground, strongly backlit by a bright light. In the right background, a helicopter and another soldier are visible, with subtitles located at the bottom of the frame. The woman turns to her right and walks away, moving deeper into the background, while the camera pans and trucks to keep her centered.",
