    "pre_caption": "This static, extreme wide shot presents a high-angle aerial view of a sprawling airport complex at night. The airport's infrastructure, outlined by glowing lights, fills the entire frame from the background to the middle ground. A brightly lit, circular terminal building is positioned in the lower right of the frame in the middle ground. In the foreground, a text overlay reading \"July 7, 2017\" is located in the center of the screen.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a wide, aerial scenery shot of a sprawling airport complex at night, with the focus on the vast scale and intricate layout of the infrastructure rather than a specific subject. The dark landscape is illuminated by a complex grid of glowing green and white lights that delineate the multiple intersecting runways and taxiways. In the lower right portion of the frame, a large, brightly lit circular terminal building is visible, with several concourses extending from it. A white text overlay in the center of the image reads \"July 7, 2017\".**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a nighttime aerial view of a large, modern airport. The scene is illuminated by artificial lights, with glowing green and white lines tracing the dark asphalt runways and taxiways, which are arranged in a grid pattern. A brightly lit, circular main terminal with several branching concourses sits at the center of the layout. The surrounding area appears as a flat, featureless greyish ground. A black rectangular overlay with the white text \"July 7, 2017\" is positioned in the middle of the screen.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly states that the airport infrastructure \"fills the entire frame from the background to the middle ground.\" The infrastructure, including taxiways and lights, clearly extends into the foreground at the bottom of the frame. The description of the camera movement as a \"downward spiral\" is also imprecise; the camera is slowly pushing in and tilting down while slightly rotating. Finally, \"center of the screen\" should be changed to \"center of the frame\" for consistency with the rest of the description.",
