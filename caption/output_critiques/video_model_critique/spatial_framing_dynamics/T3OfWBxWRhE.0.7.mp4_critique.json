    "pre_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a coastal landscape, captured from a high-angle aerial perspective. The sun is located in the top left of the frame, with its reflection extending across the water from the middle ground to the foreground. The ocean occupies the lower two-thirds of the frame. In the background, a mountainous coastline stretches along the right side, while clouds are scattered across the top half of the frame. Several small islands are positioned in the middle ground. A small section of green land is initially visible in the bottom right foreground before moving out of the frame. The time-lapse effect causes the clouds to move across the sky and creates a fast-moving ripple pattern on the water's surface, flowing from the background toward the foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a sweeping landscape scenery shot of a tropical coastline at either sunrise or sunset. A bright sun hangs low on the horizon, its golden light reflecting across the calm, blue-green ocean on the left side of the frame, illuminating scattered, orange-tinged clouds against a soft blue sky. In the distance, a mountainous coastline recedes into the haze, while a few small, dark islets dot the water. The composition lacks a central subject, instead emphasizing the grand scale and tranquil atmosphere of the natural setting, with the interplay of light and color creating the primary visual focus.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A drone video captures a stunning coastal scene at sunrise or sunset, with the sun casting a bright, golden reflection primarily on the left side of the calm, blue-green ocean. The sky features a blend of pale blue and orange hues, with scattered, puffy clouds illuminated in shades of white and orange, enhancing the serene atmosphere. In the distance, a mountainous coastline appears as a dark silhouette, while several small, dark islands are scattered across the water. At the beginning of the video, a sliver of green, grassy land with a few small palm trees is visible in the bottom right corner before moving out of the frame. The natural mist or ripple effect on the water's surface is a result of the time-lapse technique used in filming.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly describes the camera perspective as \"level-angle aerial\"; it should be corrected to \"high-angle aerial perspective\". The spatial division of the frame is also inaccurate: the ocean occupies the lower two-thirds of the frame and the sky occupies the top third, not halves. Lastly, the statement that the green land in the bottom right foreground \"moves out of the frame\" is incorrect; this element remains static throughout the video.",
