    "pre_caption": "The video opens with an extreme wide shot, where a small, maroon-caped character is positioned slightly to the right of center in the 2D frame and in the middle ground, falling downwards. Large, pale green, translucent square platforms are visible, with one in the bottom-center foreground and others in the middle ground. Slender, reddish, organic-looking structures occupy the background, fading into a hazy, bright yellow light. As the character descends towards the bottom-left, the scene expands, revealing a dark, undulating ground in the foreground at the bottom of the frame, populated by small, silhouetted, mushroom-shaped forms. More complex, branching red structures with small nodes become prominent, particularly on the right side, extending from the middle ground into the background. The character comes to rest in the bottom-center of the frame, now in the middle ground on this newly revealed lower level. The camera maintains a side-view perspective throughout, capturing the vastness of the abstract landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases a diminutive, abstract character distinguished by a disproportionately large, flowing dark maroon cape and a tuft of light blue hair or a helmet, giving it an unusual, almost insectoid silhouette. This character traverses an equally atypical environment characterized by towering, slender, organic-looking structures in hues of red and pink, which are uniquely patterned with small, square, light grey or blue nodes interconnected by fine lines, resembling biological circuitry or stylized foliage. These structures are interspersed with large, pale green, translucent, square platforms that appear to float. Further adding to the scene's peculiarity, a cluster of small, dark, silhouetted, geometrically simple, mushroom-shaped forms is nestled on a dark, undulating ground, contrasting with the grand, ethereal scale of the surrounding abstract landscape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A gaming video with a side-view perspective of the character unfolds in a surreal, abstract landscape bathed in a hazy, bright yellow light. The scene features large, pale green, flat-topped platforms and numerous taller, slender structures, some of which are reddish and fade into the bright background. As the small, maroon character moves, the environment reveals a darker, undulating ground level with smaller, indistinct shapes and more complex, branching red structures adorned with small, square nodes connected by thin lines.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.",
