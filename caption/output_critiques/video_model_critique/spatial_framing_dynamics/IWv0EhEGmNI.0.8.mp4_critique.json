    "pre_caption": "The video uses a close-up shot, framing the man’s head and upper shoulders in profile, with his face oriented toward the right side of the frame. The man is positioned in the center-right of the frame and occupies the middle ground, while the blurred upper part of a seat appears in the left foreground, partially obscuring the view. The car frame and window are visible on the far right in the background, with indistinct scenery outside. The camera is at the same height as the man’s head, capturing his profile directly from the back row. The spatial arrangement remains static throughout the video, with no significant movement from the subject or camera. Subtitles are overlaid near the lower center, and black bars at the top and bottom create a letterboxed effect.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man with light skin, a full beard, and a mustache, wearing a dark cap. He appears to be middle-aged and is shown in profile, facing to the right. His expression is neutral and focused, and his head is slightly tilted downward. The lighting highlights the contours of his face, emphasizing his facial hair and the brim of his cap. The man remains the central subject throughout the video, with no other human subjects visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set in a dimly lit indoor environment, likely inside a vehicle, with muted colors and soft, diffused lighting that casts gentle shadows across the scene. The camera angle is positioned from the back row, capturing the side profile of a bearded individual, likely the driver, from behind. Their face is partially illuminated, revealing subtle skin texture and short facial hair. In the left foreground, the upper part of the seat is prominently featured, appearing relatively blurred. On the right side, the car frame and window are visible, along with the blurred scenery outside. The background is indistinct, with subdued tones suggesting limited space and minimal visible detail beyond the subject. Overlay elements include a line of green and white text near the lower center of the scene that reads, “Price: Now if you’re having second thoughts, then I can do this on my own…,” which is not part of the physical environment but appears as a subtitle or caption. Black bars frame the top and bottom edges of the video, creating a widescreen, letterboxed effect.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains extraneous information and a slightly speculative detail. The final sentence describing subtitles and letterboxing should be removed, as these are on-screen graphics and not elements within the scene's spatial composition, which is the focus of the instructions. Additionally, the phrase \"capturing his profile directly from the back row\" is an interpretation of the setting; it should be revised to a more objective description of the camera's position, such as \"capturing his profile from a position behind and to his left.\"",
