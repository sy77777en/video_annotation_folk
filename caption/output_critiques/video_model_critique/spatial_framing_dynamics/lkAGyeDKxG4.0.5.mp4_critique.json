    "pre_caption": "In a wide, top-down aerial shot, a person is positioned in the center of the frame, walking along a narrow path that runs vertically through the scene. A ditch is located in the center of the frame, running parallel to the right of the path. These elements are situated in the middle ground, surrounded by a vast field of grass that fills the entire frame from foreground to background. As the person walks from the top of the frame towards the bottom, the camera tracks them, maintaining their central position. The camera is positioned directly above the subject.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An aerial, top-down view shows a person walking along a narrow dirt path. The individual is dressed in dark clothing, including a black vest and shorts, although the color of the shorts is not visible from this perspective, and appears to be carrying a backpack. The path they are on is flanked by fields of dry, tan grass on both sides, with a narrow, dark-watered ditch to the right of the path.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides a top-down aerial perspective of a vast, flat landscape covered in textured, dry, brownish-yellow grass. A straight, narrow dirt path bisects the scene vertically. To the right of the path, a narrow, dry, dark-watered ditch with irregular banks meanders through the field. A person with a black backpack walks along the path.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is largely accurate but contains redundancies that can be removed for better conciseness. The phrase \"walk forward toward the top of the frame\" is redundant; \"forward\" can be removed since the direction is already specified by \"toward the top of the frame.\" Additionally, the final sentence, \"The camera is positioned directly above the subject,\" repeats information already established by the opening phrase \"top-down aerial shot\" and should be deleted.",
