    "pre_caption": "The video presents an extreme wide shot of a serene landscape. The expansive field occupies the majority of the frame, stretching from the foreground to the middle ground. Patches of water are scattered across the field, located primarily in the center and slightly towards the bottom of the frame. The dry, golden grass covers most of the field, extending from the bottom left to the bottom right. The horizon line, marked by a row of bare trees, is positioned near the upper third of the frame, separating the field from the sky. These trees span horizontally across the middle ground, from the left to the right side of the frame. The sky, filled with scattered clouds, dominates the top half of the frame, providing a backdrop to the entire scene. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial position throughout the video. The camera remains stationary, maintaining a consistent perspective at a height level with the field.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a landscape scenery shot. It captures an expansive, open field with patches of water and dry, golden grass, creating a sense of vastness. The sky is filled with scattered clouds, adding depth and atmosphere. Bare trees line the horizon, emphasizing the natural environment. The focus is on the overall mood and scale of the landscape, rather than any specific object, highlighting the serene and open nature of the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an expansive outdoor setting during the day, featuring a vast, open field with patches of dry, golden grass and scattered pools of water. The sky is overcast with a layer of soft, textured clouds. In the distance, a line of bare trees marks the edge of a forest, creating a stark contrast against the sky. The scene is calm, with no visible movement, capturing the serene and quiet atmosphere of the natural landscape.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your instructions, here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption:\n\n**Feedback:**\n\nThe caption is generally well-structured and follows several key instructions, but it has significant omissions and minor inaccuracies that detract from its overall quality.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **Strengths:** The caption correctly identifies the shot as an \"extreme wide shot\" and accurately describes the camera as stationary and at a height level with the field. The placement of the field, water patches, and the horizon line near the upper third is also correct.\n*   **Weaknesses:**\n    *   The use of the subjective adjective \"serene\" violates the instruction to avoid emotional or subjective language.\n    *   The description of the trees as being in the \"middle ground\" is slightly inaccurate; they are more clearly in the background, behind the field.\n    *   The statement that the sky \"dominates the top half of the frame\" is an overstatement; it occupies closer to the top third.\n    *   The claim that there are \"no significant changes\" is incorrect. While the camera is static, there is a person moving within the frame, which constitutes a significant change in the scene's composition.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   **Major Omission:** The caption completely fails to mention the most salient subject in the scene: the person walking in the middle ground. This figure, positioned slightly to the right of center, is a key focal point and the only source of movement. The instructions explicitly state to describe the spatial framing and movement of human subjects, making this a critical oversight.\n*   **Minor Omission:** The caption also misses a small, boxy wooden structure (possibly a hunting blind) located in the middle ground, to the left of the person.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   The caption successfully follows the formatting requirements (one paragraph, no markdown) and correctly identifies the shot size and camera position.\n*   However, it fails on two crucial points:\n    1.  It uses a subjective adjective (\"serene\").\n    2.  It completely ignores the instruction to \"describe the spatial framing and movement\" of salient human subjects, which is the most significant flaw.\n\nIn summary, while the caption provides a decent basic description of the landscape, its failure to identify and describe the human subject and their movement makes it incomplete and inaccurate in its assessment of the scene's dynamics. It misses the primary action within the static shot.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video presents an extreme wide shot of a landscape. An expansive, marshy field of dry, golden grass occupies the bottom two-thirds of the frame, stretching from the foreground into the middle ground, with scattered patches of water. In the middle ground, slightly to the right of center, a person walks from left to right. A small, boxy wooden structure is also visible in the middle ground, to the left of the person. The horizon line, marked by a row of bare trees in the background, separates the field from the sky. The sky, filled with scattered clouds, occupies the top third of the frame. The camera remains stationary at a height level with the field throughout the video.",
