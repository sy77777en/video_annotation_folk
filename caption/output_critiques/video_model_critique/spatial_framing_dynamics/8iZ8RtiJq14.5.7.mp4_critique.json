    "pre_caption": "The video features a medium shot of a female-form mannequin shown from the hips up, positioned centrally in the frame. The mannequin stands with its hands on its hips, occupying the foreground. Its reflective, metallic surface contrasts with the background, which consists of vertical, brown wooden planks. A blue light from the side creates a distinct outline on the mannequin, enhancing its presence against the background. The camera remains at the mannequin's level throughout the video. Occasionally, the mannequin turns its head slightly, introducing subtle movement within the otherwise static composition. The background remains constant, with no changes in the spatial arrangement of elements.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A female-form mannequin is shown from the hips up, standing with its hands on its hips. It is dressed in a light gray business suit, which includes a two-button blazer over a v-neck top. The mannequin's body, including its hands and featureless, oval-shaped face, is made of a reflective, silver-colored metallic material. Its dark hair is tied behind its head. Throughout the video, the mannequin occasionally turns its head.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A figure with a metallic, featureless head stands with its hands on its hips in an indoor setting. The figure wears a grey, two-button business suit over a light-colored v-neck shirt. The background consists of a wall made of vertical, brown wooden planks. A blue light illuminates the figure from the side, creating a distinct outline.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This medium shot shows a mannequin from the hip up. Throughout the video, the mannequin occasionally turns their head. \n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on your instructions, here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is mostly accurate in its description of the scene's static elements. It correctly identifies the subject as a female-form mannequin, the shot size as a medium shot from the hips up, its central position in the foreground, and the background of vertical wooden planks. The description of the blue side lighting is also correct. However, the caption contains a significant factual error: it states, \"Occasionally, the mannequin turns its head slightly, introducing subtle movement.\" The video is a static image with no movement from the mannequin or any other element.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption successfully covers most of the required aspects: shot size, 2D position (center), 3D depth (foreground/background), and camera height (at the subject's level). It attempts to describe dynamics but fails due to the inaccuracy mentioned above. It provides a good level of detail about the subject and its environment.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Spatial Framing:** The caption adheres well to the instructions for describing shot size, position, depth, and camera height.\n*   **Dynamics:** It fails on this point by inventing movement that does not occur, violating the rule to \"Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain.\"\n*   **Language:** The language is simple, natural, and largely objective, as requested.\n*   **Formatting:** The caption is a single, coherent paragraph without markdown or introductory text.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe caption is well-structured and provides a good description of the static composition. However, its primary flaw is the inaccurate description of movement, which is a critical component of the \"spatial dynamics\" requirement. To be correct, the sentence about the head turning should be removed and replaced with a statement confirming the complete lack of movement in the scene.",
