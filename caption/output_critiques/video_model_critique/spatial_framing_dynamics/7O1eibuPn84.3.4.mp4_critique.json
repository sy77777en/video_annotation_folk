    "pre_caption": "The video presents a full shot of an ostrich, which is centrally positioned in the frame and occupies the middle ground. In the foreground, at the bottom of the frame, there is green vegetation with purple flowers and dry brownish grass. The background, visible above the ostrich and extending to the top of the frame, consists of more green vegetation, scattered bushes, a flat horizon line, and a bright, hazy sky with faint clouds and distant birds. A white rectangular text box containing the word \"OSTRICH\" in white capital letters is overlaid in the bottom left corner of the frame, appearing in the foreground. The camera remains static at the ostrich's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features an ostrich standing in a field. The ostrich has a large body covered in dense black feathers, a long, slender, pale pinkish-beige neck, and a small head with a reddish hue on its crown and beak area. Its long, thick pinkish legs have two distinct dark joints. The ostrich's tail consists of fluffy feathers that are a mix of white, beige, and some black. The ostrich is viewed in full left profile. In the lower left corner, the word \"OSTRICH\" is displayed in white capital letters within a white rectangular box.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene unfolds in a sunlit, open outdoor expanse, characteristic of a savanna or vast grassy plain. In the foreground, greener vegetation dotted with small purple flowers and scattered green bushes transitions into the ground, which is carpeted with dry, brownish grass. Further into the landscape, there is more green vegetation dotted with small purple flowers and scattered green bushes. The sky above is bright and slightly hazy, with faint, wispy clouds stretching towards a flat horizon line in the far distance, where distant birds can be seen in the sky. An overlay, consisting of a white rectangular box with the word \"OSTRICH\" in white capital letters, is positioned in the lower left corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

Additionally, for conciseness, the phrase \"located at the bottom of the frame\" can be removed, as the ground's position is self-evident. Finally, the description of the background \"extending to the top-center of the frame\" can be simplified to \"extending to the top of the frame\" for better clarity.",
