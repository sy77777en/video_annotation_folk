    "pre_caption": "This video presents a static wide shot of a landscape, with a houseboat included to provide a sense of scale. The foreground is composed of a rocky shoreline that fills the bottom third of the frame. In the middle ground, the houseboat is positioned in the bottom right, moored in a calm cove that extends across the center of the scene. The background is dominated by a range of large rock formations and canyons that stretch across the upper half of the frame, silhouetted against a bright horizon. The sky occupies the top of the frame. The camera maintains a fixed, slightly elevated position from the shore, looking out over the water and towards the distant canyon walls.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a serene landscape scenery shot of a calm lake nestled within a vast canyon of reddish-brown rock formations. The focus is on the grand scale and dramatic atmosphere of the natural environment rather than a specific subject. A white houseboat is moored in a small, quiet cove, its presence serving to emphasize the immense size of the surrounding landscape. The scene is set at either sunrise or sunset, with a dark, cloudy sky overhead contrasting with a bright, warm glow on the horizon, which casts a gentle reflection across the still surface of the water.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An extreme wide shot shows a large, white houseboat moored in a calm cove on a lake, surrounded by vast, reddish-brown rock formations and canyons. The time is either sunrise or sunset, with a bright glow on the horizon behind the silhouetted buttes, while the rest of the sky is covered in dark clouds. The still water reflects the sky and the surrounding landscape. A smaller boat is tied to the side of the houseboat, and a paddleboard is visible in the water nearby. The rocky, sandy shoreline in the foreground and along the edges of the cove indicates a low water level. The video is framed with black bars at the top and bottom.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption omits the smaller boat and the paddleboard moored next to the houseboat in the middle ground. The description of the sky is presented in a separate sentence, which could be more smoothly integrated with the description of the background elements. Additionally, the phrase \"with a houseboat included to provide a sense of scale\" is slightly interpretive and could be removed to maintain a purely descriptive focus on spatial framing.",
