    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a ground-level close-up shot, where the top and bottom of the frame are obscured by a dark foreground element, creating a narrow horizontal view. A pair of feet is visible in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground on a dark, reflective floor. The camera then moves upward, causing the screen to go black momentarily, before settling on a wide shot of a bedroom from an eye-level perspective. In this final frame, a rumpled bed occupies the foreground and the bottom half of the screen. A white door is visible in the left background, next to a dark dresser on the right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video initially shows a pair of pale, veiny feet and lower legs belonging to an unseen creature, viewed from a low angle as if from under a bed. The creature's feet are bare, with long, claw-like toes, and they stand on a dark, reflective floor. The perspective then shifts upwards, briefly going black before settling on a view across a bed with rumpled white sheets and a green and white plaid blanket in a dimly lit room. The creature is no longer visible in this final shot.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place in a dimly lit bedroom at night. A level-angle perspective from ground height beneath a bed shows a pair of pale, veiny feet standing on a dark, reflective wooden floor. The view then changes to a wider shot of the room, revealing a bed with rumpled white sheets and a green and white plaid blanket. In the background, a white door is visible next to a dark wooden dresser with a mirror. The entire room is cast in deep shadow, with only faint ambient light illuminating the space.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot from a ground-level perspective, capturing a pair of feet, with most of the frame is dark and covered by the bed. As the camera ascends to eye level, it reveals a wide shot of a room. During the ascend movement, a brief black screen occurs.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

The caption states, \"a dark dresser on the right,\" but it fails to mention the mirror positioned above the dresser, which is a distinct element in the background. To improve accuracy, the description should be revised to include this detail, for example: \"next to a dark dresser with a mirror on the right.\"",
