    "pre_caption": "The video maintains a wide shot throughout, with the camera positioned above the subject. Initially, a stylized character on a motorcycle is at the bottom center of the frame, situated in the middle ground, driving along a dark road that extends from the immediate foreground into the distant background. Abstract, glowing purple and pink geometric buildings line the left and right sides of the frame, occupying the middle ground and receding into the background. A numerical score is consistently displayed in the top left corner as a foreground overlay. Pink heart-shaped collectibles appear on the road in the middle ground ahead of the character. The character moves from the center lane to the left lane, then back to the center, remaining in the bottom center of the frame and the middle ground. As the character ascends a steep slope, they move slightly further into the background before leaving the motorcycle. A large, glowing pink heart symbol, initially in the middle ground, becomes prominent and shifts towards the background as the character approaches. A glowing cyan silhouette of a woman in a dynamic pose is superimposed over this heart. The character then strikes a pose in mid-air, remaining in the bottom center of the frame, now appearing in the foreground relative to the large heart symbol in the background. Pink laser-like lines are visible in the upper background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases a game scene featuring a small, stylized character wearing a blue top and dark lower body, riding a dark, glowing motorcycle on a dark road marked with bright white lines. The character navigates the road, switching from the middle lane to the left lane, performing a backflip off a ramp, and then returning to the middle lane. Along the way, the character collects various items like diamonds and hearts to earn points, with the score displayed in the top left corner. As the character ascends a long, steep slope, they leave the motorcycle and strike a dynamic, dance-like pose in mid-air. Later, a prominent, large, glowing cyan silhouette of a woman in a dynamic, almost dancing pose appears, superimposed over a large, glowing pink heart symbol. The scene is set within a city, with animated purple buildings framing the sides, and a car is visible on the right side of the road.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person 3D game video, where the entire character consistently remains at the bottom of the frame, depicts a stylized nighttime drive through a futuristic city. The scene is set on a dark asphalt road with bright white lane markings, flanked by abstract, geometric buildings that glow with purple and pink neon light; some buildings feature patterns like playing card suits. Dark, silhouetted tree-like structures extend from above. The character, a figure in a blue jacket on a motorcycle, moves forward along the road, collecting pink heart-shaped objects. As these objects are collected, numbers appear above them and float upwards before disappearing. Beams of light emanate from the motorcycle's path as the scenery scrolls past. The environment evolves, leading to a point where a large, glowing pink heart-shaped structure becomes prominent, with pink laser-like lines visible in the upper background. Overlay elements include a numerical display in the top left corner, showing glowing pink and cyan digits that increment, and occasional brief UI elements like a yellow \"GO\" text appearing on the road.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly states the character performs a \"backflip\"; it is a small jump over a slope. A more significant error is the description of the character's final position. After transforming into a silhouette, the character moves to the **center** of the frame, not the \"bottom center\" as written. The description of this final scene could also be more spatially precise. Instead of stating the silhouette is \"superimposed over one of these heart symbols,\" it would be more accurate to describe the silhouette as being framed in the foreground, positioned within the large heart symbol which occupies the middle ground.",
