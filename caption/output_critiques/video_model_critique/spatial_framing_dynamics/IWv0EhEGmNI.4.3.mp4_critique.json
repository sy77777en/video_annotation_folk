    "pre_caption": "The video begins from a first-person perspective, with a textured, speckled wall filling the center of the middle ground, and a long, horizontal pipe positioned above it at the top of the frame. A gloved hand is briefly visible in the bottom left foreground, moving upwards. Subtitles are overlaid at the bottom center, while HUD elements are present as overlays on the left and bottom right. The view then tilts upwards and moves forward, transitioning to a tiled rooftop that occupies most of the middle ground, extending from the bottom to the top of the frame. Upon reaching the rooftop, a rifle with a scope appears in the bottom center-right foreground. The HUD elements and subtitles remain in their respective foreground positions throughout. The camera maintains an eye-level perspective relative to the environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases a scene with a night vision effect, casting a green tint over everything. A person wearing tactical gloves is seen climbing an exterior staircase of a building and then ascending to the rooftop, where they retrieve a rifle. The presence of firearms and night vision equipment suggests a military or covert operation, likely within a first-person shooter game. The setting appears to be an industrial or urban environment, with textured walls and rooftops visible. The atmosphere is tense, with the person seemingly on a mission, as indicated by the dialogue about checking a fusebox.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, navigates a dark environment under a green night-vision filter. The scene begins with a close-up view of a rough, speckled surface, likely the exterior wall of a building, with a long, horizontal ladder above it. The scene then transitions as the character moves onto a tiled rooftop at night. The rooftop features rows of dark, rectangular, overlapping tiles. A rifle with a scope is visible in the lower portion of the view. Overlays include subtitles at the bottom: \"Al-Qatala Fighter 2: Power's out. I'm going to check the fusebox.\" A HUD is also present, displaying a vertical numerical bar on the left and weapon and ammunition indicators on the bottom right.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly identifies the object at the top of the frame as a \"ladder\"; only a single horizontal pipe or bar is visible, so the description should be changed to reflect that. The wall is described as being in the \"background,\" but given the first-person perspective with hands in the foreground, it is more accurately positioned in the middle ground. The description of the overlays is mentioned twice; the second sentence, \"The overlays remain in their respective positions throughout,\" is redundant and should be removed. Finally, the phrase \"transitions to a tiled rooftop\" is slightly passive; rephrasing it to describe the continuous upward movement that \"reveals\" the rooftop would better capture the shot's dynamic.",
