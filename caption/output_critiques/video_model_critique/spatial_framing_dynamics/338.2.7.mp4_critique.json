    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot of the elderly man, who is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. His upper body is visible, and he is seated at a dining table. The camera is at his eye level. As the scene progresses, the camera pans left, transitioning to a medium shot of the woman. She moves into the center of the frame, also in the middle ground, with her upper body visible. The camera remains at her eye level throughout. Both subjects are seated at the same table, which is in the foreground, with plates of food and glasses of iced beverages placed on it. The background includes other dining tables with white tablecloths and red-cushioned chairs, along with a ceiling featuring intricate patterns and a central hanging light fixture. The transition from the man to the woman is smooth, maintaining a consistent shot size and camera height while shifting the focus horizontally across the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video initially features an elderly man and then transitions to focus on a woman seated at a dining table in a restaurant. The man, wearing a maroon shirt with a pocket, has short gray hair and glasses. He is using chopsticks to eat from a plate of noodles and vegetables, with a glass of iced tea in front of him. The woman, wearing a yellow patterned blouse, also has glasses and short dark hair. She is holding chopsticks and appears to be engaged in conversation. The camera pans left, transitioning the focus from the man to the woman.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set indoors in a dimly lit restaurant with a warm, inviting atmosphere. The setting features dining tables with white tablecloths, surrounded by red-cushioned chairs. The ceiling is adorned with intricate patterns and a central hanging light fixture, casting a soft glow over the scene. Notable visual elements include plates of food, primarily noodles, placed on the table in the foreground, and glasses filled with iced beverages, adding a touch of color to the otherwise muted palette. The environment is intimate, with a focus on the dining experience. The overall ambiance is calm and reflective, with a sense of quiet conversation and shared meals.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a medium shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",

  "generated_critique": "This caption is not good for the video. It fails to accurately describe the scene and violates several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **Incorrect Shot Composition and Transition:** The most significant error is the description of the camera movement and subject framing. The caption claims the video starts with a shot of the man and then pans left to the woman. This is incorrect. The video is a single, continuous medium shot that frames both the woman (on the left) and the man (on the right) from the very beginning. There is no pan from one subject to the other.\n*   **Mischaracterization of Camera Movement:** The caption describes a \"smooth\" transition. The actual camera work is very shaky, blurry, and erratic, which is a key characteristic of the shot that the caption completely misses.\n*   **Inaccurate Details:** The caption mentions \"glasses of iced beverages\" and \"red-cushioned chairs.\" Due to the low light and motion blur, these details are not clearly visible and are speculative, violating the instruction to avoid describing uncertain elements.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption fails to describe the most prominent spatial dynamic of the shot: its unstable, shaky nature. By inventing a smooth pan, it omits the actual visual information about the camera's movement.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Fails to describe what is visible:** The caption invents a camera pan that does not exist and ignores the constant presence of both subjects in the frame.\n*   **Fails to avoid speculative statements:** It includes details about the background and table setting that cannot be confirmed from the blurry video.\n*   **Fails to accurately describe spatial dynamics:** It misrepresents the shaky, continuous shot as a smooth, transitioning pan, fundamentally misinterpreting the spatial dynamics of the scene.\n\nIn summary, the caption is fundamentally flawed because it describes a sequence of events and camera movements that do not happen in the video. It fabricates a smooth pan while ignoring the actual shaky, continuous framing of both subjects.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A shaky, blurry medium shot captures an elderly woman and man eating at a dining table in a dimly lit restaurant. The woman, wearing a yellow top, is on the left side of the frame, while the man, in a reddish-brown shirt, is on the right. Both are positioned in the middle ground, with their upper bodies visible. The camera is unsteady, creating significant motion blur that obscures fine details. In the foreground, their plates of food are visible on the white tablecloth. The background is dark and out of focus, with the warm glow of a light fixture visible in the upper right. The entire shot is characterized by its erratic, handheld-style movement.",
