    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a motorcycle rider in a blue and white suit is positioned in the center-right foreground, with the white front of their motorcycle occupying the bottom right of the frame. To their left, another rider on a black and turquoise motorcycle is initially positioned in the top-left middle ground before moving further left and partially out of the frame. The camera, fixed at the main subject's level, captures the forward motion along the track, causing background elements like a large black arch in the center and spectators on the left to move from the distant background into the middle ground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person in a blue, white, and red \"Avintia\" branded racing suit is riding a white Ducati motorcycle. The rider wears a black full-face helmet with red and white graphics and a sticker with the text \"@hectorbarbera\" on top. Their gloves are white, red, and blue, with the word \"VICTOR\" visible in red on the right glove. Riding alongside them is another person in a black \"MACNA\" racing suit on a black and turquoise motorcycle that features \"idda\" and \"e-motion\" branding.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot from a motorcycle captures a high-speed race on a paved asphalt track under a bright, sunny sky with scattered white clouds. The dark gray track is bordered by green grass, trees, and distant spectators. Another motorcycle, colored black and blue with white lettering, races alongside. The camera's perspective remains fixed as it speeds down a straightaway, approaching a large black inflatable arch with white and green branding. The white front of the motorcycle with red lettering and the rider's blue, white, and red racing suit are prominent in the foreground as the landscape rushes by.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains a factual error regarding the spatial position of the secondary subject. It states, \"To their right, another rider on a black and blue motorcycle is initially positioned in the top-left middle ground,\" but the video clearly shows this second rider is on the main rider's left. This should be corrected to \"To their left...\". Additionally, describing the shot as a \"medium shot\" is less precise for this first-person perspective; \"In a point-of-view shot\" would more accurately describe the framing where the rider's helmet and arms are in the foreground. Finally, the description of the background elements \"appearing to recede\" is slightly misleading; as the camera moves forward, the background elements move past and out of the frame on the left, rather than simply getting smaller in the distance.",

The camera, fixed from the main subject's perspective, captures the rapid forward motion along the track, causing background elements like a large black arch in the center and spectators on the left to move past and out of the frame.",
