    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of four individuals in white protective suits, with the camera positioned at their level. The group occupies the foreground and middle ground, with three individuals seated closely together on the left side of the frame, facing a screen in the center. The fourth individual, wearing a red top hat, stands slightly behind and to the right of the seated group, also facing the screen. The screen itself is centrally located in the background, displaying a small white figure against a dark backdrop. Throughout the sequence, the standing individual turns his head towards the camera briefly before returning his gaze to the screen. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial positioning of the subjects within the frame. The overall composition maintains a consistent focus on the group's interaction with the screen.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a group of four people, all dressed in white protective suits with hoods, gathered around a screen. One of them, a man distinguished by a red top hat with a small brown band around the base, stands out among the others. The three other individuals, whose faces are not visible, are focused on the screen, which displays a small, white figure. The scene suggests a setting where the group is observing or analyzing something on the screen.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place in a stark, minimalist indoor setting with a monochromatic color scheme dominated by white. The environment features a group of individuals dressed in white, full-body suits with hoods, gathered around a small screen. One person stands out with a distinctive red top hat, adding a splash of color to the scene. The screen displays a small, white figure against a black background, drawing the group's attention. The setting is devoid of additional furniture or props, emphasizing the focus on the screen and the individuals' interaction with it. The overall atmosphere is one of curiosity and observation.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on your instructions, here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is largely accurate. It correctly identifies the shot size as a \"medium shot,\" the number of individuals, their attire, and their general placement. The description of the standing individual with the top hat on the right and the seated group on the left is correct. The description of the head turn is also accurate. However, describing the screen as being in the \"background\" is slightly imprecise; given it's the central focus and not far behind the subjects, \"middle ground\" would be more accurate. The statement that there are \"no significant changes in shot size or spatial positioning\" is inaccurate because it completely overlooks the most significant spatial change in the video: the small white figure on the screen shrinks and disappears.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is incomplete. It fails to describe the central action of the scene, which is a key spatial dynamic. The white figure on the monitor is a subject of focus for both the characters and the viewer. Its rapid shrinking is a crucial piece of visual information that the caption omits entirely. A complete description would detail this change in the figure's size.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption adheres well to most instructions. It is a single, concise paragraph in natural English, avoiding speculation and emotional language. It successfully describes the shot size, 2D and 3D positions of the main subjects, and the camera height. However, it fails on the instruction to \"describe the spatial framing and movement of subjects\" completely, as it misses the movement/spatial change of the figure on the screen. This omission also makes the statement about \"no significant changes\" incorrect, violating the instruction to be accurate.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe caption provides a good foundation by correctly framing the human subjects. Its primary weakness is the failure to describe the key action on the screen—the shrinking of the figure—which is the most important spatial dynamic in the clip and the reason for the characters' focus.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video presents a medium shot from a level angle, capturing four individuals in white protective suits within a sterile white room. Three of the figures are grouped on the left, observing a monitor placed in the middle ground. To their right stands a fourth individual, wearing a red top hat over his white hood, who leans in towards the screen. The monitor initially displays a small, white, human-like figure against a black background. The central action of the scene is the rapid shrinking of this figure on the screen until it disappears entirely. While this occurs, the man in the top hat briefly turns his head to address the others before looking back at the screen. The camera and the other subjects remain in a fixed position.",
