    "pre_caption": "From an over-the-shoulder perspective, the camera captures a close-up shot from a high angle, looking down at the scene. The subject's arm and shoulder occupy the right foreground of the frame. Positioned in the center middle ground is a rectangular wooden box, angled from the top left towards the bottom right. In the bottom left foreground, a sketchbook is partially visible, while a container of crayons sits in the top left background. The subject's hand enters from the right foreground, moves towards the center to open the box lid, and then reaches into the box to touch the telescope resting inside. The camera remains static throughout the entire shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From an over-the-shoulder perspective, a person wearing a striped tan and grey long-sleeved shirt opens a rectangular wooden box. The box, made of dark wood with brass hinges, has a reddish-brown felt-lined interior. Nestled inside is a long, cylindrical telescope wrapped in dark brown leather, which features a decorative chain-like stitch running along its length. The telescope is capped with brass-colored metal on its ends, and the person's hand reaches out to touch it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From an over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind the character, showing only their left arm and the scene ahead, a person opens a rectangular wooden box resting on a desk. The interior of the box is lined with red fabric and holds a vintage telescope wrapped in dark, stitched leather with brass-colored metal ends. Next to the box, a sketchbook with a drawing of a full face is visible, and a container of crayons sits in the background. The person's hand lifts the lid and then reaches in to touch the telescope.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera captures an over-the-shoulder shot of a person, focusing on a close-up of their hand opening a rectangular wooden box on a table, revealing a long leather telescope inside.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly states the subject's hand enters \"after opening the box lid\"; the video begins with the box already open, and the hand moves from the lid to the telescope. Additionally, the final sentence is contradictory, stating the camera \"remains static\" while also \"featuring a subtle zoom-in effect.\" The camera is not static; it performs a slow zoom-in, and this part should be rephrased for accuracy.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From an over-the-shoulder perspective, the camera captures a close-up shot from a high angle, looking down at the scene. The subject's arm and shoulder occupy the right foreground. In the center, a rectangular wooden box is held open, angled from the top left towards the bottom right. Inside the box, a vintage-style, leather-wrapped telescope with brass ends rests on a red felt lining. A sketchbook is partially visible in the bottom left, with a container of crayons in the top left background. The shot begins with the box already open, and the subject's hand moves from holding the lid to gently touching the telescope. Throughout the shot, the camera performs a slow, subtle zoom-in, focusing more tightly on the telescope within the box.",
