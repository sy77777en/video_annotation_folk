    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of a large passenger airplane in the foreground, with its white fuselage and windows clearly visible. The aircraft occupies the right side of the frame, while the explosion occurs near its wing, positioned slightly towards the center-left. Initially, bright orange flames and thick black smoke dominate the middle ground, emerging from the wing area. The hangar, located in the background on the left side, is brightly lit, creating a stark contrast against the dark night sky. As the video progresses, the explosion intensifies, causing the hangar to collapse. The flames and smoke increase in volume, gradually obscuring more of the hangar and the aircraft. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout, maintaining a fixed perspective that captures the unfolding chaos. The spatial dynamics shift as the explosion evolves, with the smoke and flames expanding from the center-left towards the center-right, eventually dominating the middle ground and partially obscuring the hangar and the airplane. The wet tarmac reflects the bright lights, adding depth to the scene. The camera's stationary position emphasizes the dramatic impact of the explosion and the subsequent destruction.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a large passenger airplane with a white fuselage and visible windows, positioned prominently in the foreground. The aircraft is partially engulfed in a fiery explosion, with bright orange flames and thick black smoke emanating from its wing. The explosion creates a dramatic contrast against the night setting, with the flames illuminating the scene. In the background, a hangar with bright lights is visible, providing a stark contrast to the dark sky. The sequence captures the intensity of the explosion and the subsequent smoke, highlighting the dramatic impact on the airplane.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a dramatic scene at an airport during nighttime, with a locked-on POV shot fixed to an aircraft. The setting is outdoors, featuring a large airplane adjacent to a hangar. The environment is illuminated by bright lights on the hangar, casting reflections on the wet tarmac. A significant explosion occurs as the airplane crashes into the hangar, causing it to collapse. Flames and thick black smoke engulf the wing of the aircraft, with the fire's intense orange and yellow hues contrasting against the dark night sky. The scene transitions from the initial explosion to the aftermath, where smoke continues to billow, partially obscuring the view of the collapsed hangar and the aircraft. The fixed perspective emphasizes the unfolding chaos and destruction.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is mostly accurate in its description of the main elements. It correctly identifies the medium shot, the airplane in the foreground on the right, the explosion in the middle ground, and the hangar in the background. However, there are a few inaccuracies:\n*   The description states \"the explosion intensifies, causing the hangar to collapse.\" The explosion is a singular, instantaneous event at the start. What follows is the aftermath. Also, the entire hangar does not collapse; rather, a large structure connected to it (possibly a jet bridge or part of the entrance) falls.\n*   It says \"The flames and smoke increase in volume.\" The initial fireball is quickly replaced by a large plume of smoke. The flames do not persist or increase; the smoke does.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very thorough. It successfully identifies and describes the spatial framing of the key subjects (airplane, explosion, hangar) in terms of 2D position, 3D depth, and their relationship to each other. It also correctly notes the camera's height and stationary position, and describes the spatial dynamics of the smoke's expansion. The detail about the wet tarmac is a good addition.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption follows most instructions well but deviates in a few key areas:\n*   **Violation:** The instruction is to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The caption uses phrases like \"stark contrast,\" \"unfolding chaos,\" and \"dramatic impact,\" which are subjective interpretations of the scene's mood rather than objective descriptions of its spatial properties.\n*   **Partial Adherence:** The description of the collapse (\"the hangar to collapse\") is an overstatement and could be seen as an uncertain interpretation. A more objective description would focus only on the visible part that is falling.\n*   **Good Adherence:** The caption successfully provides a single, coherent paragraph, uses natural English, and covers shot size, position, depth, height, and spatial movement as requested.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe caption provides a good and detailed analysis of the scene's spatial composition and dynamics. Its primary weaknesses are the inclusion of subjective, emotional language and a slight inaccuracy in describing the sequence of the explosion and the extent of the structural collapse. By refining these points to be more objective and precise, the caption would fully align with the instructions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video presents a medium shot of a large passenger airplane in the foreground, its white fuselage and windows occupying the right side of the frame. An explosion occurs in the middle ground near the airplane's wing, which is positioned toward the center-left. The initial blast consists of a bright orange fireball and black smoke emerging from the wing area. In the background on the left, a hangar is brightly lit against the dark night sky. Following the blast, the fireball is replaced by a large plume of black smoke, and a large structure attached to the front of the hangar falls forward. The smoke expands from the center-left toward the center-right, gradually obscuring parts of the hangar and the aircraft. The camera remains stationary and at the subject's level throughout, maintaining a fixed perspective on the event. The wet tarmac in the foreground reflects the hangar's lights, adding depth to the scene. The camera's stationary position records the sequence of the explosion and the subsequent structural failure.",
