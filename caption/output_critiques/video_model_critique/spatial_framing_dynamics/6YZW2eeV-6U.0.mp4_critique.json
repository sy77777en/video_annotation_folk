    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a first-person POV shot, capturing two people walking through an ancient stone passageway. The first person, in an orange top, is positioned slightly to the left and in the middle ground, while the second person, wearing a white hat, is to the right and also in the middle ground. Both individuals occupy the lower half of the frame, emphasizing the towering stone walls in the background. As the video progresses, a third person in a blue and white jacket enters from the lower right, with only the upper body visible, positioned in the foreground. The camera remains at the subjects' height throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective. The stone walls, with their rugged textures, dominate the upper half of the frame, creating a sense of depth and scale. The passageway narrows as the group moves forward, with the camera smoothly following their movement, maintaining their central position within the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video, filmed from a first-person POV, follows three people walking through an ancient structure. Initially, the first person, wearing an orange top, black trousers, and carrying a blue backpack, leads the group. The second person, following closely, is dressed in a white hat, a striped shirt, and denim shorts, carrying a red backpack. Later, a third person appears from the lower right of the frame, positioned at the very end, with only his upper body visible, wearing a blue and white jacket. The people occupy only half the frame's height, emphasizing the ancient stone walls and pathway surrounding them.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, capturing an outdoor setting with towering stone walls forming a narrow passageway. The environment is characterized by large, rugged stone structures with visible textures and markings, suggesting an ancient or historical site. The ground is paved with interlocking bricks, adding a structured element to the scene. The time of day is late afternoon, indicated by the long shadows cast on the ground and the warm, golden sunlight illuminating the stone surfaces. The scene includes a few individuals walking through the passage, contributing to a sense of movement and exploration. The overall atmosphere is defined by the interplay of light and shadow, enhancing the visual depth of the stone architecture.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This video is filmed from a first-person POV and follows three people walking through an ancient structure. In the beginning,  two people are fully visible in the frame. Later, a third person in blue shows up from the left, showing only his upper body. The people take up only half the frame's height, leaving more content to emphasize the surroundings.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good for this video. It contains several significant inaccuracies and fails to adhere to key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **Shot Type:** The caption incorrectly identifies the shot as a \"first-person POV shot.\" A POV shot shows what a character sees from their own eyes. This is a follow shot from the perspective of someone walking with the group, as evidenced by the appearance of another person's shoulder and head in the foreground on the right.\n*   **Subject Positioning:** The initial spatial positioning of the subjects is described inaccurately. The person in the striped shirt and white hat is in the center of the frame, not \"to the right.\" The person in the blue and orange top is slightly ahead of them, also near the center, not \"slightly to the left.\"\n*   **Speculative Description:** The statement \"The passageway narrows as the group moves forward\" is speculative and not clearly evident in the video. The walls appear to be parallel, and the perceived narrowing is a natural effect of perspective. The instructions explicitly state to avoid speculative statements.\n*   **Subjective Language:** The use of the word \"ancient\" to describe the stone passageway is a subjective interpretation, which the instructions advise against.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   **Shot Size:** The caption completely omits the shot size, which is the first piece of information required by the instructions. The video is a medium long shot of the people walking.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   The caption fails on the primary instruction to specify the **shot size**.\n*   It provides inaccurate information about the **spatial position** of the main subjects.\n*   It violates the rule to **avoid speculative statements** (\"The passageway narrows\").\n*   It violates the rule to **avoid subjective adjectives** (\"ancient\").\n\nWhile the caption correctly identifies the camera height, the general camera movement, and the depth of the elements (foreground, middle ground), its foundational errors in describing the shot type and subject positions make it an inaccurate and therefore poor description of the video's spatial framing.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A medium long follow shot captures a group of people walking through a passageway between large, textured stone walls under a clear blue sky. In the middle ground, a man wearing a white hat, a striped shirt, and a red backpack walks near the center of the frame. Slightly ahead of him is another person in a blue and orange top. In the foreground on the right, the shoulder and side of the head of a person in a blue and white jacket are visible. The people occupy the lower half of the frame, with their long shadows cast on the brick path before them. The tall, sunlit stone walls dominate the upper half. The camera, positioned at the subjects' height, moves smoothly forward, following the group and keeping them centered in the frame.",
