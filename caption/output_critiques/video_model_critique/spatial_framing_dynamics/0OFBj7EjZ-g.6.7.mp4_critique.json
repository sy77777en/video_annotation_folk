    "pre_caption": "The video presents a full shot of a sleek, angular object with a futuristic design, occupying a significant portion of the frame throughout. Initially, the object is positioned near the center-left of the frame, partially submerged in what appears to be a dark, water-like surface in the foreground. As the video progresses, the object rises vertically, moving from the foreground into the middle ground, and eventually hovers above the surface. The object's orientation shifts from a tilted angle to a more horizontal position, revealing its multifaceted structure. A thin, vertical green light remains consistently in the background, slightly to the right of the object. The camera maintains a fixed position, capturing the object's movement from below, emphasizing its ascent and rotation. The dark background and water-like surface remain static, providing a stark contrast to the dynamic motion of the object. The lower left corner consistently displays the text \"[5]\".",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a sleek, angular object with a futuristic design, resembling a stylized, abstract sculpture. It has a metallic surface with a reflective finish, displaying a combination of dark and light tones that shift as the object rotates. The object resembles a flattened triangular shape with many angular edges. Its shape is asymmetrical, with sharp edges. The object’s orientation changes, highlighting its multifaceted structure and intricate design.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video showcases an abstract, minimalist scene with a dark background resembling a water surface. A central metallic object with a sleek, angular design is suspended in the air. A thin, vertical green light is also in the background. There is added text in the lower left corner that shows “[5]”.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on your instructions, here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\nThe caption provides a good overview of the video's content, successfully identifying the main subject and its movement. However, it has several inaccuracies and fails to adhere strictly to all the negative constraints in the instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **Partially Inaccurate:** The description of the object's initial position as \"near the center-left\" is slightly off; the object starts closer to the absolute center of the frame.\n*   **Inaccurate:** The caption states, \"A thin, vertical green light remains consistently in the background, slightly to the right of the object.\" The green light is actually fixed in the vertical center of the frame; it's the object that is positioned around it.\n*   **Major Error:** The caption incorrectly states, \"The lower left corner consistently displays the text '[5]'.\" The video actually shows the timestamp \"00:00\" in the top-left corner. Describing an element that is not present is a significant error.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is generally complete, covering the shot size, the 2D and 3D positions of the main elements, the camera's height, and the spatial dynamics of the object's movement.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violation:** The caption uses the subjective adjectives \"sleek\" and \"futuristic,\" which violates the instruction to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\"\n*   **Violation:** The phrase \"what appears to be a dark, water-like surface\" violates the instruction to \"Avoid speculative statements like 'it appears'\". The audio confirms it's a liquid, so it could be described more directly as a \"dark liquid.\"\n*   **Violation:** As mentioned under accuracy, the caption describes a non-existent element (\"[5]\"), which goes against the core principle of describing only what is visible.\n\n### Revised Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised version of the caption that corrects the errors and adheres more closely to the instructions:\n\nA close-up shot shows an angular, metallic-looking object. Initially, the object is in the center of the frame, partially submerged in a dark liquid in the foreground, creating ripples. A thin, vertical green line of light is positioned in the center of the frame, extending from the top to the bottom edge, passing through the object and into the background. The object then rises vertically out of the liquid, moving from the foreground into the middle ground where it hovers. As it rises, its orientation shifts from a tilted angle to a more horizontal one, revealing its multifaceted structure. The camera remains in a fixed, low-angle position, looking up at the object throughout its ascent. The dark background and the liquid surface remain in place, with the timestamp \"00:00\" visible in the top-left corner.",
