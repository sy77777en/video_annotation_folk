    "pre_caption": "In this medium shot, a man is positioned in the right middle ground, playing a drum kit. Elements of the drum kit, including two cymbals, occupy the foreground at the bottom left and bottom center. The cityscape and rooftops fill the background across the frame, with green hills visible in the far background at the top. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man with light skin and short hair, wearing a light blue suit jacket over a white hoodie. He is playing a drum set, which includes cymbals, and is positioned in a way that suggests he is actively engaged in drumming. The man is facing away from the camera, focusing on the drums, with his body slightly turned to the side. His posture indicates concentration and energy as he plays.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set on a rooftop overlooking a cityscape under a grey, overcast sky. In the foreground, a drum kit is positioned, with its golden, circular metal cymbals clearly visible. The surrounding view includes various other rooftops, a brick chimney, and a distant background of green, rolling hills. A person in a light-colored hooded jacket is situated at the drum kit, seen from the side as they play.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
