    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot, focusing on a section of embossed text on a dark, textured surface. These lines of text, positioned in the foreground, are angled relative to the viewer; the characters in the right-central area of the frame are most prominent and in sharp focus, while the text extends horizontally across the frame, receding towards the left edge and slightly into the middle ground where it becomes less distinct. The dark surface itself forms the immediate background to these raised characters. The shot then transitions to a medium shot, effectively pulling the camera's perspective back. In this wider view, a larger expanse of the inscribed surface is revealed, showing more lines of the embossed text which now appear smaller within the frame, allowing the viewer to see a broader context of the inscription. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout this transition.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a close-up view of a dark, metallic-looking surface, possibly stone or metal, featuring embossed text. The text is arranged in horizontal lines and appears to be an ancient script, with characters resembling Greek letters. These characters are raised from the surface, creating a three-dimensional effect with subtle shadows. The surface itself has a slightly weathered or textured appearance, with some areas appearing lighter, almost like a thin layer of frost or dust, particularly around the embossed letters. As the video progresses, the camera arcs clockwise, gradually revealing a full view of the object from a distance ahead. The overall color palette is cool and desaturated, predominantly dark grey or a muted blue.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video begins with a close-up of a dark, textured surface, possibly metallic or stone, with lines of embossed, Greek-like characters. The lighting is dim, casting subtle highlights on the raised letters, which appear slightly weathered. The surface has a cool, bluish-grey tone. As the camera moves in a clockwise arc to the front of the surface, it transitions to a full shot.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption inaccurately describes the shot size transition and makes an assumption about the subject. The term \"full shot\" is incorrect, as this term typically refers to a shot showing a subject from head to toe; a more appropriate description would be a \"wider shot\" or \"medium close-up.\" Additionally, the statement that \"the whole inscription becomes the center\" is an assumption, as the full extent of the inscription is not shown. The description of the transition could also be more precise. Instead of \"The shot then transitions,\" it should specify that the camera continuously pulls back. A more accurate description would be: \"The video begins with an extreme close-up shot of embossed text on a dark surface, with the characters in the right-central foreground in sharp focus while the text to the left is out of focus. The camera then continuously pulls back into a wider close-up, revealing a larger portion of the inscription that now occupies the center of the frame. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout this movement.\"",
