    "pre_caption": "This close-up, top-down shot initially frames a piece of paper with a drawing in the center-left middle ground. A right hand in the foreground is positioned over the drawing in the top-right quadrant, while a left hand, also in the foreground, holds the paper's edge at the bottom-left. The right hand moves away from the drawing and off-screen to the right. Both hands then re-enter the frame from the left and right sides to grasp a reddish-brown box in the center-right middle ground. As the hands lift the lid, the open box, filled with various keepsakes, comes to occupy the center and right portions of the frame. The hands remain in the foreground on either side of the box, while the original drawing is now partially visible in the bottom-left corner.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a top-down perspective, a pair of light-skinned hands in a light-colored, long-sleeved shirt interacts with a collection of items on a textured surface. Initially, the hands are near a piece of beige paper featuring a child's drawing in black with a hint of red crayon, depicting an exaggerated, scraggly monster. Several red perforated metal discs and round metal washers are scattered on the paper. The hands then move to open a rectangular, reddish-brown box, revealing its contents. Inside the box is an assortment of objects, including a small brass compass, two colored spinning tops, some old black-and-white photographs, handwritten letters with legible Spanish handwriting, a rusty metal disc with several holes and a noticeable crack, and other small trinkets.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An overhead POV shot captures a top-down view of a scene set on a dark, multi-colored, textured rug. Initially, a chaotic drawing of a black-and-red monster on aged paper is visible, surrounded by several red perforated metal discs, small metal washers, a screw, and a bottle cap. A pair of hands moves from the drawing to open a dark red, rectangular box, revealing a collection of keepsakes. Inside the box are various items, including a small compass, two wooden spinning tops, old black-and-white photographs, handwritten letters in Spanish, stamps, and other small trinkets.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The description of the right hand's movement is slightly inaccurate. Instead of stating it \"remains in the frame,\" it should be described as moving toward the right edge of the frame. More importantly, the caption omits the action of the box being brought into the frame; it currently reads as if the hands simply grasp a box that is already present. To improve accuracy, the sentence \"Both hands then grasp a reddish-brown box, which occupies nearly the entire frame\" should be revised to clarify that the hands bring the box into the scene from the top right, placing it over the drawing.",
