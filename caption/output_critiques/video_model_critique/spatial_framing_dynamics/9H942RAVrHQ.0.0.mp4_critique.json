    "pre_caption": "A circular object is positioned in the center-foreground on a gridded surface. A hand enters from the right side of the frame, moves to the center to grasp the object, and then moves back to the right before exiting the frame. The object is then thrown from the right, appearing as a circle in the top-center of the frame. It falls to the center-foreground, where it bounces multiple times in the same position on the grid. The camera remains stationary at a height level with the action on the grid throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video displays a black line-drawn human hand, featuring five fingers and a portion of an arm, interacting with a circular object. The hand grasps the object, which is then thrown. It bounces three times in the same position and briefly deforms into an oval each time as it makes contact with a gridded surface, before bouncing back up and regaining its circular form.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a minimalist, monochromatic setting, a gray perspective grid extends across a white floor against a plain white background. A hand-drawn hand enters the scene to pick up a circular object from the grid. The hand then throws the object, which bounces on the gridded surface, deforming with each impact.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work. The caption is accurate, complete, and adheres strictly to all instructions.\n\n### Feedback:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subjects (hand, circular object), their initial positions (\"center-foreground\"), and their sequence of movements (hand enters from right, grasps, exits; object is thrown, falls, bounces).\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is very thorough. It successfully covers all the required aspects:\n    *   **Shot Size:** While not explicitly named (e.g., \"close-up\"), the level of detail provided about the hand and object implies a close shot, which is appropriate.\n    *   **Spatial Position (2D & 3D):** The use of terms like \"center-foreground,\" \"right side of the frame,\" and \"top-center\" effectively maps out the scene's composition in both two and three dimensions.\n    *   **Spatial Dynamics:** The movement of both the hand and the object is described clearly and sequentially, detailing their paths across and within the frame.\n    *   **Camera:** The final sentence correctly identifies that the camera is stationary and its height is level with the action, fulfilling a key instruction.\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption excels at following the negative constraints. It avoids subjective language, speculation, and any information not visually present. It is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English, focusing entirely on the spatial framing as requested.\n\nThe caption is a perfect example of how to apply the given instructions to the video content. No improvements are needed.",
