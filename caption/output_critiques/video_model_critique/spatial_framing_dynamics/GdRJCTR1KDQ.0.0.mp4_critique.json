    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot. A tennis racket is positioned diagonally in the center of the frame, extending from the bottom left towards the top right, in the middle ground. A yellow tennis ball enters from the top left, also in the middle ground, and moves towards the racket. Upon impact, the ball bounces upwards and exits the frame from the top left. Simultaneously, the racket, initially in the center, begins to descend towards the bottom of the frame. Red and purple dust, which was on the racket, explodes outwards, initially retaining the racket's shape in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. This dust cloud then expands and disperses, with the red portion more prominent on the left and the purple on the right, before slowly drifting downwards and losing its defined shape as the racket moves further down. The background remains consistently dark and out of focus. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a close-up of a tennis ball and a tennis racket. The tennis ball, yellow and textured, bounces into the frame, making contact with the racket. The racket, primarily red and white and angled slightly upward, is covered in red and purple dust, which initially retains the shape of the racket upon impact. This creates a striking visual effect as the dust disperses in slow motion. As the ball bounces out of the frame, the racket descends due to the force, and the dust begins to lose its shape and fall, adding dynamic movement to the scene. The background is dark, enhancing the visibility of the dust and the vibrant colors.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a dynamic scene featuring a tennis racket and ball, with a focus on their interaction. The lighting suggests a well-lit environment, possibly during daylight. Notable visual elements include the vibrant colors of the racket and the ball, with a striking effect of colored powder or dust being dispersed upon impact. This creates a visually engaging moment, highlighting the motion and energy of the sport. The dark, blurred background emphasizes the vivid colors and movement in the foreground.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video showcases a close-up of a tennis ball bouncing into a tennis racket in a speed ramp effect. Upon impact, the ball bounces out of the frame while the racket descends due to the force. The racket appears to have red and purple dust, which initially retains the shape of the racket in slow motion, creating a visually pleasing effect. Toward the end, the dust loses its shape and begins to fall.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

It states that the ball \"enters from the top left... and moves towards the racket.\" In the video, the shot begins with the ball already in contact with the racket's strings on the left side. The action that follows is the ball bouncing *away* from the racket, not moving toward it. The description should be corrected to state that the ball is initially on the racket and then bounces upwards and away to the top left.",
