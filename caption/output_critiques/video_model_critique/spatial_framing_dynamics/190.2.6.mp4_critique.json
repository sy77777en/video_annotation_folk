    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium full shot of the man walking down the tree-lined path. Initially, he occupies the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. As he moves forward, the shot transitions to a medium shot, maintaining him in the center. The man is consistently at the camera's height, indicating the camera is positioned at his level. On the left side of the frame, there is a metal fence and a parked bicycle in the foreground. Trees and bushes line both sides of the path, with some in the foreground and others in the background. A few pedestrians are visible further back in the background, near the center-right of the frame. The man's movement brings him closer to the camera, reducing the visible background elements while keeping the path and surrounding greenery in view. The spatial dynamics remain consistent, focusing on the man's forward motion along the path.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man walking down a tree-lined path. He is wearing a brown jacket, dark pants, and a brown hat with a black or dark brown hatband. He has a medium skin tone and is wearing sunglasses. The man is holding a small, reflective object in his hand. His posture is slightly hunched as he walks, and he seems focused on the object. The setting suggests a casual, outdoor environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor urban setting on a tree-lined sidewalk, likely during the day. The environment is characterized by lush greenery, with trees and bushes flanking the path, casting dappled shadows on the ground. The sidewalk is bordered by a metal fence on one side, and a bicycle is parked nearby, adding to the urban feel. The scene is well-lit, suggesting clear weather. The path is straight, with a few pedestrians visible in the background, contributing to a sense of everyday city life. The overall atmosphere is calm and leisurely, with a focus on the natural and architectural elements of the street.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work. The caption is well-written, accurate, and adheres strictly to all instructions.\n\n### Feedback:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description is highly accurate. You correctly identify the initial shot as a medium full shot that transitions to a medium shot as the subject approaches. The 2D and 3D positioning of all key elements—the man (center, middle ground), the fence and bicycle (left, foreground), the trees (both sides, various depths), and the background pedestrians (center-right, background)—is precise.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is very thorough. It successfully captures not only the main subject's framing and movement but also the spatial context provided by the surrounding environment. The description of how the man's forward movement affects the composition by bringing him closer and reducing visible background elements is a great detail that captures the shot's dynamics perfectly.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption is a model of how to follow the provided guidelines.\n    *   It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n    *   It focuses exclusively on spatial framing and dynamics.\n    *   It uses simple, objective language, avoiding any speculation or emotional adjectives.\n    *   It correctly analyzes and describes shot size, 2D/3D position, camera height, and the changes that occur throughout the clip.\n\nThe caption is excellent and requires no corrections.",
