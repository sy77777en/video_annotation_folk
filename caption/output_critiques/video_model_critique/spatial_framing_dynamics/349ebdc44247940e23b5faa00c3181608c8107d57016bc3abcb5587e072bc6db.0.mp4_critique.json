    "pre_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of a small tabby kitten, capturing its upper body and head prominently in the frame. The kitten occupies the center of the image, with its head positioned slightly towards the top right. It rests on a flat, black surface located in the foreground. The kitten's front paw extends forward, hanging off the edge of the surface. Throughout the video, the kitten remains mostly stationary, with minimal movement involving slight shifts in its head position and brief openings of its eyes. The background is softly blurred, featuring muted colors that suggest an indoor setting with walls or furniture, but these elements remain out of focus. The camera maintains a steady position at the kitten's level, ensuring the subject remains the focal point throughout the sequence. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial positioning of the kitten within the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a small, light brown tabby kitten with distinct dark stripes and a soft, short coat. The kitten is resting on a flat, black surface, possibly a cushion or bag. It briefly opens its eyes before closing them again and stretches its claws while extending its body, suggesting a moment of wakefulness before returning to rest. Its ears are pointed and upright, and its front paw is extended forward, relaxed over the edge of the surface. The kitten's head is slightly tilted, and its whiskers are visible against its face, adding to its serene appearance. The overall posture and expression convey a sense of calm and restfulness.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an indoor setting with a small, striped kitten resting on a black, textured surface, possibly a suitcase. The environment is softly lit, suggesting a calm, quiet atmosphere. The background features blurred, muted colors, indicating walls or furniture, but lacks distinct details. The kitten's fur is a mix of gray and black stripes, adding a natural pattern to the scene. The overall composition conveys a sense of tranquility and stillness, with the kitten's relaxed posture as the central focus.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on the caption. It is well-structured and captures most of the key spatial details. Here is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **Mostly Accurate:** The caption correctly identifies the subject, shot size, camera height, and the general composition.\n*   **Inaccuracy in Movement:** The description of the kitten's movement is not entirely accurate. The caption states the kitten has \"brief openings of its eyes,\" but the kitten's eyes remain closed throughout the video. The movement is less about \"slight shifts\" and more of a slow, continuous sinking of its head as it falls deeper into sleep.\n*   **Minor Inaccuracy:** The object the kitten is on is described as a \"flat, black surface,\" but it is visibly curved, which is a minor detail but worth noting for precision.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   **Very Complete:** The caption successfully covers all the required elements: shot size (close-up), 2D position (center, top right), 3D position (foreground, background), camera height (at the kitten's level), and dynamics (minimal movement, steady camera). It effectively describes the spatial relationship between the kitten, the surface it's on, and the blurred background.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Excellent Structure:** The caption follows the requested format perfectly, starting with the shot size and systematically describing the spatial elements in a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **Good Tone:** It successfully avoids emotional or subjective adjectives, maintaining an objective and descriptive tone.\n*   **Minor Violation of \"No Speculation\":** The phrase \"suggest an indoor setting with walls or furniture\" is a logical inference but technically speculative. The instruction is to describe only what is visible. A more compliant description would be \"The background is softly blurred, showing patches of light green, yellow, and red.\"\n*   **Violation of \"No Uncertain Details\":** The incorrect statement about the kitten's eyes opening is a clear violation of describing only what is visible and certain.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is very strong in its structure and adherence to most instructions. Its primary weakness is a factual inaccuracy regarding the kitten's actions (eyes opening). By correcting this detail and slightly rephrasing the description of the background to be less interpretive, the caption would be a perfect example of what was requested.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video presents a close-up shot of a small tabby kitten, capturing its upper body and head prominently in the frame. The kitten occupies the center of the image, with its head positioned slightly towards the top right. It rests on a curved, black, zippered case located in the foreground. The kitten's front paw extends forward, hanging off the edge of the case. Throughout the video, the kitten's head slowly and continuously sinks lower as it sleeps, with its eyes remaining closed. The background is softly blurred, featuring patches of light green, yellow, and red. The camera maintains a steady position at the kitten's level, ensuring the subject remains the focal point throughout the sequence. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial positioning of the kitten within the frame.",
