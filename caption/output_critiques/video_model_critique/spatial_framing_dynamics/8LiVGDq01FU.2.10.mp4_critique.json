    "pre_caption": "This video uses a medium full shot, capturing a person in a spacesuit from approximately the knees up. The person is positioned slightly left of the center within the frame and occupies the middle ground. Tall, vertical structures are visible on the right side of the frame, extending into the background. Horizontal lines dominate the scene, appearing in the foreground, middle ground, and background, stretching across the frame's width. The camera is positioned level with the subject. There are no changes in shot size or the subject's position during the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a person wearing a dark, full-body spacesuit with a helmet, standing in a futuristic, metallic environment. The suit has distinct light-colored stripes and padding, suggesting a design for protection or specialized activity. The person is oriented with their back to the viewer, slightly leaning forward with arms extended, possibly indicating movement or interaction with the surroundings. The setting is characterized by vertical and horizontal lines, contributing to a high-tech, industrial atmosphere. The lighting is dim, with reflections on the surfaces, enhancing the sleek and modern aesthetic.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place in a dark, indoor setting dominated by tall, vertical structures. These structures feature numerous parallel, horizontal lines that appear reflective or illuminated, creating a complex pattern of light and shadow throughout the space. A figure, viewed from behind, stands within this environment. They are wearing a grey and white suit with darker grey or black sections, including a helmet, and have a device mounted on their right forearm.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption provides a detailed and accurate description that fully adheres to all instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **Shot Size:** \"Medium full shot... from approximately the knees up\" is a precise and correct description of the framing.\n*   **Subject Position:** Accurately places the person \"slightly left of the center\" (2D) and in the \"middle ground\" (3D).\n*   **Other Elements:** Correctly identifies the \"tall, vertical structures on the right side... in the background\" and the pervasive \"horizontal lines\" across the foreground, middle ground, and background.\n*   **Camera Height:** \"The camera is positioned level with the subject\" is an accurate assessment.\n*   **Dynamics:** Correctly notes that the framing is static, with \"no changes in shot size or the subject's position.\"\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption successfully covers all the required analytical points: shot size, 2D and 3D positioning of all key visual elements, camera height relative to the subject, and the static nature of the shot.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   The description focuses strictly on spatial framing and dynamics.\n*   It uses clear, objective, and natural language, avoiding speculation or emotional terms.\n*   It is presented as a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or markdown.\n*   It successfully analyzes and describes the composition of the scene as requested.\n\nThe caption is an exemplary response that perfectly fulfills the prompt's requirements.",
