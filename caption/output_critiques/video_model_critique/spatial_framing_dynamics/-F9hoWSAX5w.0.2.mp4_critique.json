    "pre_caption": "The video features a wide shot of an urban street scene, capturing the full length of the sidewalk and the surrounding buildings. Initially, one individual in dark clothing and a hooded jacket is positioned near the center of the frame, walking away from the camera in the foreground. This person holds an umbrella and moves steadily forward. As the video progresses, two additional individuals appear from the left side of the frame, entering the middle ground. They walk side by side behind the first person, each carrying a coffee. These three figures maintain their respective positions throughout the video, with the initial individual remaining slightly ahead. The buildings line both sides of the street, with illuminated signs such as a fast-food logo on the left and a pub sign further down the road, situated in the background. Streetlights cast a warm glow, reflecting off the wet pavement, which occupies the lower portion of the frame. Pigeons are scattered across the sidewalk, primarily in the foreground and middle ground. The camera remains at eye level relative to the subjects, providing a consistent perspective of the scene. The spatial arrangement and movement of the subjects create a dynamic flow along the urban street.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video depicts a dimly lit urban street scene with three distinct individuals. One person, wearing dark clothing and a hooded jacket, walks slightly ahead holding an umbrella. Behind them, two others walk side by side, each carrying a coffee. The street is lined with buildings featuring illuminated signs, including a recognizable fast-food logo and a pub sign. A few pigeons are visible on the ground, adding to the urban atmosphere. The overall scene conveys a typical city street with pedestrians and ambient lighting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot of an urban street scene with a somewhat dark and overcast sky, making it challenging to determine the exact time of day. The setting is outdoors, featuring a narrow city street lined with buildings. Notable elements include a McDonald's sign on the left and a pub sign further down the street, indicating a lively area. The wet pavement reflects the glow of streetlights, suggesting recent rain. Pigeons are visible on the ground, adding to the urban atmosphere. The scene captures the movement of pedestrians walking along the sidewalk, contributing to the dynamic city environment. The overall ambiance is characterized by the interplay of artificial lights and the damp street, creating a typical cityscape.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe caption is well-structured and follows many of the core instructions. It correctly identifies the shot size, camera height, and the general movement within the scene. However, it contains several inaccuracies, speculative details, and omissions that detract from its overall quality and adherence to the rules.\n\n**Detailed Feedback:**\n\n*   **Accuracy and Speculation:**\n    *   **Incorrect Detail:** The caption states the initial individual wears a \"hooded jacket.\" This is incorrect; the person is wearing a dark jacket, but no hood is visible. The individuals who enter later wear hoods, but the first one does not.\n    *   **Speculative Detail:** The caption claims the two individuals who enter are \"each carrying a coffee.\" This is not clearly visible in the video and is a speculative assumption, which directly violates the instruction to \"Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain\" and \"Avoid speculative statements.\"\n    *   **Inaccurate Spatial Description:** It states the two additional individuals \"enter[] the middle ground.\" They actually enter from the left into the **foreground** and then proceed to walk into the middle ground.\n\n*   **Completeness:**\n    *   **Omission of a Key Element:** The caption fails to mention the large, dark structure that dominates the entire right side of the frame. This element, likely an elevated train track or overpass, is crucial to the scene's composition, as it frames the action and creates a tunnel-like effect. Its omission is a significant gap in the description of the spatial framing.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Strengths:** The caption correctly identifies the \"wide shot,\" describes the 2D and 3D positions of several elements (buildings, signs, pigeons), notes the movement of the subjects away from the camera, and correctly identifies the camera height as \"eye level.\" It is also written as a single, coherent paragraph.\n    *   **Weaknesses:** As mentioned above, it fails on the key instructions to avoid speculation and to describe all major spatial elements. The final sentence, \"create a dynamic flow,\" while not strictly wrong, leans towards being an interpretive rather than a purely descriptive statement.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe caption provides a decent foundation but needs significant revision to be fully compliant with the instructions. To improve, it must remove the speculative detail about the coffee and correct the inaccurate descriptions of the clothing and the entry point of the subjects. Most importantly, it needs to include a description of the large structure on the right to provide a complete picture of the scene's spatial framing.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is a wide, eye-level shot of a wet urban sidewalk at night or in the early evening. A large, dark structure, likely an elevated train track, occupies the entire right side of the frame, creating a tunnel-like view down the street. In the foreground, a person in a dark jacket walks away from the camera down the center of the sidewalk, carrying a closed umbrella. Shortly after, two more people in dark, hooded clothing enter from the left foreground and walk behind the first individual. Buildings line the left side of the street, with an illuminated McDonald's sign in the foreground and a red neon sign for \"MILLER'S PUB\" further down in the middle ground. Streetlights cast a warm glow, reflecting off the wet pavement that fills the lower portion of the frame. A few pigeons are scattered on the sidewalk in the foreground and middle ground. The camera remains stationary throughout the shot as the three people walk further down the sidewalk.",
