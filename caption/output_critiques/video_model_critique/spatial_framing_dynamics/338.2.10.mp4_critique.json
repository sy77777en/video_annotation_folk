    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of a woman seated at a table. The subject occupies the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. Her upper body is visible, from approximately the waist up. She is seated directly facing the camera, which is at her eye level. To her left (the viewer's right), there is a glass of iced tea in the foreground, slightly off-center. In front of her, on the table, are various dishes, including a plate of greens and another dish with mixed ingredients, also in the foreground. A brown container is situated in the bottom right corner of the frame, also in the foreground. The background is dimly lit, providing contrast and focusing attention on the subject and the table setup. There are no noticeable changes in shot size, position, or camera movement throughout the sequence. The spatial arrangement remains constant, emphasizing the subject and the items on the table.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a woman seated at a table, wearing a maroon vest with a name tag that reads \"Susan\" over a white shirt. She has medium-length dark hair and is wearing glasses. The woman is holding chopsticks in her right hand above a plate of food, sitting upright and remaining still. The table is set with various dishes, including a plate of greens and a glass of iced tea. The lighting focuses on her, highlighting her calm and composed demeanor.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set indoors, featuring a dining table with a variety of dishes. The environment is dimly lit, creating a focused atmosphere on the table's contents. The table is covered with plates of food, including a dish with greens and another with a mix of ingredients, possibly noodles or rice. A glass of iced tea with a lemon slice is prominently placed, adding a refreshing element. A brown container is located at the bottom right of the frame, contributing to the overall composition of the scene. The setting includes a person seated at the table, wearing a uniform with a name tag, suggesting a formal or professional context. The overall color scheme is warm, with earthy tones from the food and the person's attire. The scene remains consistent throughout, maintaining a steady, observational perspective.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n\n*   **Partially Inaccurate:** The caption incorrectly describes the position of the glass of iced tea. It states the glass is \"To her left (the viewer's right),\" but it is actually on the woman's right side, which is the viewer's left.\n*   **Inaccurate:** The container in the bottom right is described as \"brown,\" but it is clearly red.\n*   **Slightly Inaccurate:** The caption places all the dishes in the \"foreground.\" While the glass and the red container are in the foreground, the plates of food are better described as being in the middle ground along with the woman, as they are the focus of her action and are positioned further from the camera than the foreground elements.\n\n**Completeness:**\n\n*   The caption is very complete. It successfully identifies and describes the shot size, the subject's 2D and 3D position, the camera's height, and the static nature of the shot. It also includes descriptions for multiple secondary elements on the table, fulfilling the instruction to analyze as many elements as possible.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Good Adherence:** The caption follows the single-paragraph structure, uses natural English, and avoids speculative language. It correctly identifies the shot size, position, and camera height as requested.\n*   **Minor Deviation:** The phrases \"providing contrast and focusing attention\" and \"emphasizing the subject\" lean towards interpretive analysis rather than purely objective spatial description. While not a major violation, the instructions favor avoiding such statements to maintain objectivity.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is well-structured and mostly adheres to the detailed instructions. However, its value is significantly diminished by critical factual errors regarding the spatial location of an element and the color of another. Refining the 3D positioning of the dishes and removing the minor interpretive phrases would also improve its adherence to the prompt's strict guidelines. The correction of the factual errors is the most crucial change needed.",
