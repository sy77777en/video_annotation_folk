    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a view of the ocean, showing gentle waves across the entire frame, with no major subject visible, creating a wide shot of the scenery. The camera is positioned above the water, looking down. As the camera moves forward and tilts upward, a large ship gradually enters the frame from the top left, initially with only a small part of the hull visible. The ship, featuring a dark hull and a lighter superstructure, becomes the main subject in a wide shot. It is positioned slightly left of center in the midground, with a prominent yellow derrick centrally located on the ship, slightly towards the bow. The ocean remains in the foreground, while the sky with clouds forms the background. The camera is at the ship's level when the subject is fully revealed. Text overlays appear in the bottom left corner, providing historical context.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video starts with a view looking down at a choppy, dark blue ocean surface. As the camera moves forward and tilts upward, a large ship gradually comes into full view, initially appearing partially at the top left of the frame with just a small part of the hull visible. The ship, with its long, dark-colored hull and lighter-colored, multi-level superstructure, eventually appears slightly left of center in the midground. A prominent, tall, yellow, lattice-like derrick or crane structure is centrally located on the ship, slightly towards the bow. The ship is positioned on the vast expanse of the ocean under a hazy, overcast sky with some visible clouds.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone shows a vast expanse of deep blue ocean under a slightly overcast sky. The water has gentle, rolling waves. In the distance, a long, dark-hulled ship with a white superstructure and a prominent yellow drilling derrick on its deck appears to be moving towards the left side of the frame, with its bow facing slightly to the left rear. An overlay of the text \"[2]\" is visible in the bottom left corner of the scene, and as the video progresses, the overlay text \"1974\" also appears, indicating the historical context of the video.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a wide shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly describes the video's opening. The ship is visible from the start in the background, not absent. The initial camera position is not \"above the water, looking down,\" but very low, close to the water's surface, and moving forward rapidly, creating motion blur in the foreground. The caption also inaccurately states that the ship \"gradually enters the frame from the top left.\" The ship is already in the frame; the camera's movement, which involves rising and slowing down, brings the distant ship into clearer focus in the midground. Finally, the description of the text overlay as \"providing historical context\" is an interpretation and should be removed; simply stating that text appears in the bottom left corner is sufficient to describe its spatial presence.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with a low-angle, fast-moving shot across the surface of the ocean, creating motion blur in the foreground waves. A large ship is visible in the distance from the start. The camera then rises and slows down, bringing the ship into clearer focus as the main subject in the midground. The final shot shows the ship, which has a dark hull, a lighter superstructure, and a prominent yellow derrick, positioned slightly left of center. The ocean is in the foreground, with a hazy sky and clouds in the background. Text appears in the bottom left corner.",
