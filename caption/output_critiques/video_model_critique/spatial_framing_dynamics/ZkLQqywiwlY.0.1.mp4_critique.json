    "pre_caption": "This video presents a static wide shot of a grey brick building wall in an urban alley. The wall is positioned at an angle, extending from the right foreground to the left background. The scene is initially plain, featuring a doorway on the far right, a boarded-up arched window in the center-right, and a \"NO PARKING\" sign in the middle ground on the left. Animated graphics then appear sequentially on the wall. First, a large, orange and green hand-like shape holding a horn materializes in the right foreground, partially covering the doorway. Simultaneously, a stylized yellow fire hydrant appears in the center-right foreground below the window, a blue character appears to its left, and a small, colorful bush forms in the bottom left. Subsequently, a black lamppost appears to the left of the arched window, and a large green tree-like figure on a pink base materializes on the left side of the frame, creating a complete mural. The camera remains stationary at an eye-level height throughout the transformation.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a cityscape scenery shot focused on the side of a grey brick building in an urban alley. There is no single main subject, as the shot's purpose is to establish the environment and showcase the transformation of the space. The scene is initially a plain brick wall featuring a boarded-up, arched window with a security grate, a \"NO PARKING\" sign, and a doorway on the right. Colorful, flat-style animated graphics then appear on the wall, creating a vibrant mural. This includes a large orange hand holding a green and pink horn that emits musical notes, a stylized fire hydrant, a blue robot-like character sitting next to a lamppost, and green leaves on a pink and white base that resembles roots.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an urban alley, colorful animated graffiti appears on a grey brick wall. The scene features a boarded-up, arched window with a metal grate and a \"NO PARKING\" sign on a pole. The animation begins with a large, orange and green hand-like shape holding a pink horn, from which musical notes emerge. Subsequently, a blue character sitting on the ground, a lamppost, a yellow fire hydrant, and a large, green tree-like figure held by a pink base materialize on the wall, creating a vibrant mural against the muted background.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly states that several animated graphics appear \"simultaneously.\" In the video, the hand with the horn appears first, followed by the fire hydrant, the blue character, and the bush in a rapid but clear sequence. The caption also omits the appearance of the pink and blue musical notes that emanate from the horn. To correct this, the description of the animation's appearance should be rephrased to reflect this sequence, for instance: \"First, a large, orange and green hand-like shape holding a horn materializes in the right foreground, emitting colorful musical notes. This is followed in quick succession by a stylized yellow fire hydrant appearing in front of the window, a blue character to its left, and a small, colorful bush in the bottom left.\"",
