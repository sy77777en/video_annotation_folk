    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of an urban environment, capturing a broad view of the cityscape. Initially, the camera focuses on the left side of the frame, showing a sidewalk lined with trees in the foreground and middle ground. As the video progresses, the camera pans right, transitioning smoothly from the initial left side to the right side of the frame. This movement reveals a wide intersection in the center and right portions of the frame. Traffic lights and road signs occupy the top left and center areas, while vehicles are seen moving across the intersection in the middle ground. Pedestrian crosswalks appear prominently in the lower center and right sections of the frame. The background features buildings and trees, adding depth to the scene. The camera maintains a consistent height, positioned slightly above street level, providing a clear view of the entire intersection and surrounding area. The spatial composition shifts from a focus on the sidewalk to a broader perspective of the urban intersection, emphasizing the dynamic interplay between natural and built environments.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing an urban environment with elements like traffic lights, street signs, and crosswalks. The focus is on the overall environment rather than a specific object, highlighting the interaction of architecture, streets, and natural elements like trees. The presence of cars and pedestrians adds to the dynamic urban setting, while the sky and distant structures contribute to the sense of scale and space.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video begins with the camera focused on a sidewalk, showcasing pedestrians and the vibrant mix of green and pink foliage from the trees lining the path. It then pans right to reveal an urban street scene during the day, featuring a wide intersection with visible traffic signals and road signs. The environment is outdoors, blending natural and urban elements. The sky is overcast, suggesting cloudy weather. Buildings of varying heights are visible in the background, contributing to the urban setting. Cars move through the intersection, and more pedestrians are present on the sidewalks, indicating a bustling city atmosphere. The crosswalks and road markings are clearly defined, enhancing the structured layout of the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good for this video.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption inaccurately describes the camera movement as a \"smooth\" pan. The transition is a very fast, blurry whip pan, not a smooth one.\n*   The description of the final scene's elements (intersection, cars, signs) is generally accurate in terms of their placement.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption completely omits the most prominent subject at the beginning of the video: the person with pink hair and a black mask in the bottom-left foreground. The instructions state to focus on salient human subjects, and this is a major omission.\n*   It fails to describe the initial forward movement of the camera before the pan begins.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   The caption fails to follow the instruction to \"focus your description on their spatial framing and movement\" when a salient human subject is present. It ignores the person entirely.\n*   It does not accurately describe the \"spatial dynamics\" of the camera movement, mischaracterizing the fast whip pan.\n*   While it describes the spatial framing of the scenery in the second half of the video, its failure to account for the initial subject and the true nature of the camera's motion makes it an inadequate description according to the provided rules.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins from a point-of-view perspective, moving forward along a sidewalk. A person with pink hair, sunglasses, and a black mask is framed in the lower-left foreground. The camera then executes an extremely fast whip pan to the right, which blurs the scenery. The motion stops to reveal a wide, static shot of a city street intersection. The foreground is dominated by pedestrian crosswalks. In the middle ground, several cars are driving through the intersection. Traffic lights are visible in the upper left, with buildings and trees filling the background.",
