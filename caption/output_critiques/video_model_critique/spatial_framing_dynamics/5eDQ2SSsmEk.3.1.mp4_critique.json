    "pre_caption": "The video displays an extreme close-up shot of a piece of paper with handwritten calculations. The shot size remains consistent throughout, capturing the entire paper within the frame. The paper occupies the center of the frame, with its 2D position remaining central from start to finish. In 3D space, the paper is in the foreground, with no other elements in the middle ground or background. The camera slowly pans across the paper, starting from the top left and moving towards the bottom right, revealing different sections of the handwritten content. This movement allows viewers to see various parts of the paper, including the numbers and arithmetic operations. The camera appears to be positioned above the paper, providing a top-down view. There are no changes in the camera's height relative to the paper during the sequence. The focus remains sharp on the paper's surface, highlighting the details of the handwriting and the paper's texture.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a close-up view of a piece of paper with handwritten calculations. The paper has a yellowed, aged appearance, suggesting it might be old or frequently handled. The handwriting is in dark ink, with numbers and arithmetic operations prominently displayed. The calculations are organized in columns, with some numbers underlined for emphasis. The paper's surface shows slight creases and shadows, indicating it is not perfectly flat. The focus is on the numerical values, with figures like \"82,000\" and \"87,000\" clearly visible, suggesting a financial or quantitative context.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a close-up view of a weathered piece of paper with handwritten calculations. The paper, with a yellowed and slightly crumpled texture, features numbers and symbols written in dark ink. The lighting is warm, casting soft shadows that highlight the paper's creases and the boldness of the ink. The setting is indoors, with no additional elements visible, focusing entirely on the paper's surface and the calculations it bears. The scene remains static, emphasizing the details of the handwriting and the paper's aged appearance.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: Lacking background information, it's difficult to determine the camera height relative to the subject, but it appears to be above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "Your feedback on the caption is as follows:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is inaccurate in two key areas. First, it incorrectly states that the shot is \"capturing the entire paper within the frame.\" The video clearly shows an extreme close-up where only a small section of the paper is visible at any time. Second, the description of the paper's 2D position as \"remaining central from start to finish\" is misleading. The paper itself is a large surface that the camera moves across; it is the camera's point of focus that stays relatively central, not the entire subject.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is mostly complete. It correctly identifies the shot size (extreme close-up), the subject (paper with calculations), the 3D position (foreground), the camera movement (slow pan), and the camera's height (top-down view). However, it fails to accurately describe how much of the subject is visible, which is a critical component of spatial framing.\n\n**Adherence to the Instruction:**\nThe caption adheres to several instructions, such as using simple language, avoiding speculation, and describing camera height and movement. However, the significant inaccuracies regarding what is framed and the subject's position violate the primary goal of providing a precise description of the spatial framing. The instruction asks to \"describe how much of the subject is visible,\" and the caption's claim that the \"entire paper\" is visible is a direct contradiction of the visual evidence.\n\nIn summary, while the caption correctly identifies the shot type and camera action, its description of the subject's framing and position is fundamentally incorrect. To improve, the caption should state that only a portion of the paper is visible and describe how the camera pan brings different sections of the handwriting into the central part of the frame over time.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "An extreme close-up shot shows a small portion of an old, yellowed paper with handwritten calculations. The paper is in the foreground, filling the entire frame. The camera slowly pans diagonally across the document, moving from the upper left towards the lower right. This movement brings different sections of the handwriting, including various numbers and arithmetic operations, into the center of the frame over time. The shot is filmed from a top-down perspective, and the camera's height remains constant. The focus stays sharp on the details of the handwriting and the paper's textured surface throughout the video.",
