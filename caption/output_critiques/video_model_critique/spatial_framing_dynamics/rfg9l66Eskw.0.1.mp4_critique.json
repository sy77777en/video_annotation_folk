    "pre_caption": "A wide shot frames a male blackbuck positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. Vibrant green grass occupies the foreground, while a blurry line of trees under a pale blue sky constitutes the background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, and the composition remains static throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A male blackbuck stands in a vibrant green, grassy field. The antelope has a dark brown to black coat, with distinct white fur circling its eyes and on its muzzle. Its long, black horns spiral upwards and outwards, forming a prominent V-shape. The animal is positioned in the right-center of the view, facing forward and looking directly ahead at the camera.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video begins with an overlay element resembling a shutter effect, where a black block snaps into place, revealing a blackbuck with a dark coat, white facial markings, and long, spiraling horns standing in a vast, sunlit grassy field. The foreground is composed of vibrant green grass, while the distant background features a soft, blurry line of trees under a pale blue, hazy sky. The scene is captured from a distance, creating a shallow depth of field that keeps the animal in focus.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

Additionally, the word \"vibrant\" is a subjective adjective and should be removed to comply with the instructions.
