    "pre_caption": "The video features a medium close-up shot of a man positioned slightly to the right of the center in the frame, occupying the foreground. He is engaged in conversation, with visible hand gestures that emphasize his points. The camera is at the subject's eye level, maintaining a consistent perspective throughout the scene. In the background, another person is partially visible, positioned slightly to the left, adding depth to the composition. This person is in the middle ground, with their features less distinct. The setting includes warm lighting and a striped fabric pattern, contributing to the cozy atmosphere. The camera remains steady, focusing on the man's expressions and gestures, while subtitles appear at the bottom of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man with a medium skin tone and a short, neatly trimmed beard. He is wearing a light-colored shirt with a dark pattern and has short hair. The man appears to be engaged in a conversation, as his facial expressions change from a slight grimace to a more focused look. He gestures with his hand, emphasizing his points. In the background, another person is partially visible, wearing a colorful, striped shirt, but their features are not clear. The setting suggests an indoor environment, possibly a restaurant or café.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents an indoor setting, likely a cozy, dimly lit restaurant or bar, with an over-the-shoulder POV showing a character's upper body and the scene ahead. The environment features warm lighting, with a mix of red and green hues creating a relaxed atmosphere. The background includes a striped fabric pattern, possibly on a booth or seat, adding a touch of color and texture. The character is engaged in conversation, with visible gestures. Overlays include subtitles at the bottom, displaying dialogue in yellow text.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption.\n\n**Feedback:**\n\nThe caption is partially accurate but has significant errors and omissions regarding the specific instructions. It fails to correctly describe the spatial depth and misses key framing elements and movements.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **Partially Accurate:** The shot size is described as a \"medium close-up,\" which is acceptable, though \"close-up\" would also be accurate. The man's position \"slightly to the right of the center\" is a reasonable interpretation. The description of the camera being at \"eye level\" and \"steady\" is correct.\n*   **Inaccurate:**\n    *   The caption incorrectly places the main subject in the \"foreground.\" He is in the middle ground, framed by an out-of-focus element in the extreme foreground (the back of a person's head on the left).\n    *   It incorrectly places the person in the background in the \"middle ground.\" That person is clearly in the background. This shows a misunderstanding of spatial depth terminology.\n    *   The caption uses the subjective adjective \"cozy,\" which violates the instruction to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\"\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption completely omits the significant out-of-focus element in the extreme foreground on the left, which is crucial for understanding the shot's depth and composition.\n*   It fails to describe the most prominent spatial dynamic in the clip: the man's hand moving from his mouth forward, toward the camera, into the foreground space. It describes the *purpose* of the gesture (\"emphasize his points\") rather than its spatial movement.\n*   It omits other visible background elements, such as the second out-of-focus person on the far right and the red neon light.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   The caption fails to provide a consistently accurate description of the 3D positions (foreground, middle ground, background) for the elements it mentions.\n*   It violates the rule against using subjective language.\n*   It misses the instruction to describe \"any changes\" or \"spatial movements,\" as it does not detail the movement of the man's hand.\n\nIn summary, the caption correctly identifies some basic aspects like camera height and stability but fails on the core requirements of accurately describing the spatial depth (3D position) of all key elements and capturing the primary spatial movement within the shot.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A close-up shot shows a man in the middle ground, framed on the left by the dark, out-of-focus silhouette of another person's head and shoulder in the extreme foreground. The man, positioned slightly to the right of center, initially has his right index finger to his mouth. As he begins to speak, he moves his hand forward toward the camera, into the foreground space, gesturing with his finger. In the out-of-focus background, another person is seated behind him, and a third person is partially visible on the far right. A red neon light glows in the upper background. The camera remains steady at the man's eye level throughout the shot. Subtitles appear at the bottom of the screen.",
