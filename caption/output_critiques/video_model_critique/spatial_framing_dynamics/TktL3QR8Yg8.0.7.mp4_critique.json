    "pre_caption": "In a close-up shot, a pair of hands holding a metal tool and a small, threaded screw occupies the center-right foreground. In the background, the out-of-focus face of a person is positioned on the left side of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, with a shallow depth of field that keeps the hands and the tool in sharp focus while rendering the background indistinct.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a close-up view, a person's brown-skinned hands carefully hold a long, dark metal tool. The hands are adjusting a small, silver-colored, threaded screw that is being pressed against the long, dark metal component attached to the main tool. In the blurred background, the out-of-focus face of a person with brown skin, dark hair, and dark eyes can be seen.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor setting, a close-up shot focuses on a pair of hands holding a long, dark metal tool. One hand presses a small, silver-colored metal piece with a threaded screw against the tool. The background is completely out of focus, showing only the blurred outline of a person's face. The shallow depth of field isolates the precise action of the hands and the metallic components.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
