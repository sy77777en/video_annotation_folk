    "pre_caption": "This wide shot begins with a woman in a purple dress standing in the center foreground on a wooden boardwalk, looking into an animal enclosure that occupies the middle ground. An elephant is partially visible in the far left middle ground, near a tan building in the background. As the camera trucks and pans to the right along the boardwalk, the woman in purple shifts to the left of the frame and exits. A couple enters from the right foreground, walking along the boardwalk and moving toward the center of the frame. Other visitors are visible walking in the middle ground on the right. The pan reveals more of the park's trees and an elevated track in the background. The camera is positioned at approximately the subjects' eye level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A group of people are seen on a wooden boardwalk at what appears to be a zoo. A woman with her back to the camera stands looking at an enclosure; she has brown hair in a ponytail and wears a long, light purple dress and a grey backpack. A couple walks past her from the right. The woman in the couple has shoulder-length brown hair and is wearing a cream-colored top, a long teal skirt, and carries a large blue and white tote bag. The man walking with her has short dark hair, wears a white face mask, a blue denim jacket over a white t-shirt, and dark pants. Other people are visible in the middle ground.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, combines trucking and panning to the right along a wooden boardwalk at an outdoor animal park during the day. The boardwalk has a brown wooden top rail and metal and glass safety barriers, overlooking a large enclosure with a dirt ground, a moat-like body of water, and gray rock formations. A one-story, tan-colored building with a flat roof stands at the back of the enclosure, where an elephant is partially visible. In the distance, beyond the park's lush green trees, a light blue elevated track and a tall, dark tower are visible against an overcast sky as other visitors walk along the path.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",

Additionally, the caption omits a prominent element: the tall, dark tower visible in the top center background at the start of the shot.
