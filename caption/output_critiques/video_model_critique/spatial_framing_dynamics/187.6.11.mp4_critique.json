    "pre_caption": "This video features a close-up shot of a woman positioned on the left side of the frame, occupying the foreground/middle ground. In the background, on the right side, a door is visible. Subtitles are overlaid at the bottom center of the frame. The camera remains level with the subject, and there are no significant changes in framing or the subject's position during the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a woman with a medium to dark skin tone, wearing a patterned headscarf that covers her hair. Her profile is visible, showing a calm expression. She is dressed in a dark-colored top with a light-colored collar. The lighting is warm and dim, casting soft shadows on her face. Her presence is central to the video, and she is engaged in a conversation.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set indoors, featuring a dimly lit room with warm, muted lighting that suggests a sunset setting, casting soft shadows and creating a cozy, intimate space. An open door is visible in the background. The walls are plain, and the lighting creates a calm, subdued atmosphere. The scene includes a person wearing a patterned headscarf, positioned near the door, with their face partially illuminated by the ambient light. The video includes overlay elements, specifically subtitles at the bottom of the screen, displaying dialogue between two individuals: \"Is that you, Fardosa? -Yeah, mom. How was the party? -It was alright. I will tell you about it tomorrow. Okay, remember to pray.\" The text is white and clearly legible against the darker background, providing context to the interaction without being part of the physical scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
