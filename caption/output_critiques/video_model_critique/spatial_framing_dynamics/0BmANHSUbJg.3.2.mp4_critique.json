    "pre_caption": "The video shows a medium shot of two men in a well-lit indoor setting, likely an office or laboratory. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level, capturing their upper bodies. The man in the gray suit with a red flower on his lapel is centered in the foreground, occupying the left side of the frame. His position remains relatively stable throughout the video. The second man, dressed in a dark suit, is partially visible on the right side of the frame, positioned slightly further back in the middle ground. He faces the man in the gray suit, indicating a direct interaction. The background consists of large cabinets and storage units, which remain static and unchanging. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial position of the subjects during the video; both men maintain their initial positions, suggesting a steady and focused interaction. The camera angle and height stay constant, emphasizing the dialogue between the two men in this professional environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two men in a well-lit indoor setting. The man on the left is wearing a gray suit with a white shirt and a beige tie, accented by a red flower on his lapel. He has short brown hair and a clean-shaven face, appearing to be in his 30s. His expression shifts from speaking to a more neutral look. The second man, partially visible on the right, is dressed in a dark suit with a white shirt. His hair is light brown and styled neatly. Both men are standing and facing each other, suggesting a conversation or interaction between them.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a third-person over-the-shoulder POV shot, capturing a character's upper body from behind in an indoor setting. The environment appears to be a modern office or laboratory, characterized by clean lines and a minimalist design. The space is well-lit with fluorescent ceiling lights, casting a bright, even illumination. The walls are a neutral color, and there are large cabinets or storage units with handles, suggesting a functional workspace. The floor is smooth and light-colored, complementing the overall sleek aesthetic. The time of day is indeterminate due to the artificial lighting. The scene remains consistent throughout, focusing on the interaction between individuals in this professional setting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on your instructions, here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption:\n\nThe caption is generally good and captures many of the key spatial elements. However, it can be improved in terms of accuracy, adherence to instructions regarding speculation, and precision.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n\n*   **Good:** The caption correctly identifies the shot size as a \"medium shot,\" the camera height as \"at the subjects' level,\" and the static nature of the scene.\n*   **Needs Improvement:** The main subject (man in the gray suit) is described as being in the \"foreground.\" This is inaccurate. In this over-the-shoulder shot, both subjects are in the **middle ground**. The man on the right is simply closer to the camera, but not close enough to be considered a foreground element. The caption also describes him as \"centered,\" whereas \"center-left\" would be more precise.\n\n**Completeness:**\n\n*   The caption is quite complete, covering the shot size, the 2D and 3D positions of both subjects, the background elements, the camera height, and the lack of movement.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Avoid Speculation:** The caption violates the instruction to avoid speculative statements with the phrase \"likely an office or laboratory.\" A more objective description would be \"an archive or storage room,\" based on the visible shelving units.\n*   **Avoid Subjective/Interpretive Language:** The caption includes interpretive phrases like \"suggesting a steady and focused interaction\" and \"emphasizing the dialogue.\" While these are reasonable conclusions, the instructions ask for a purely descriptive account of spatial framing, not an analysis of cinematic intent.\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is a bit wordy. It could be made more concise while retaining all the necessary information.\n\n---\n\nHere is a revised version of the caption that more closely follows all instructions:\n\nThis is a static medium shot filmed at eye level. A man in a gray suit occupies the center-left of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. To the right, another man is partially visible from behind, also in the middle ground, creating an over-the-shoulder perspective. The background is filled with large, white storage cabinets in a records room. The spatial framing, including shot size, camera angle, and the subjects' positions, remains unchanged throughout the video.",
