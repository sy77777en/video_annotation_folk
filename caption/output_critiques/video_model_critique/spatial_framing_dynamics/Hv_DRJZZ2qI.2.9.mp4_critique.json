    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot, featuring a man in a blue and black jacket from behind in the center foreground. In the middle ground, another man in a yellow and green jersey runs from the left of center toward the foreground. A wooden fence and a white sign are visible in the middle ground on the right, with spectators scattered across the hills in the background. As the man in yellow moves into the foreground, the two men embrace in the center of the frame, causing the shot to widen to a medium full shot. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man, viewed from behind, wears a black and grey camouflage jacket with blue sleeves and the word \"STRAIT\" in white letters. He also wears a white, red, and yellow helmet and yellow gloves. Another man, wearing a bright yellow and green long-sleeved jersey, matching pants, and a black helmet, runs towards him. The two men then embrace in a hug.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors in a dry, arid landscape characterized by reddish-brown dirt and rolling hills. A wide dirt path winds through the terrain, which is dotted with sparse green scrub brush. In the background, spectators are visible standing on the elevated hillsides under an overcast sky. A simple wooden fence runs alongside the path, near a white sign that reads \"WORLD TOUR\". Two individuals in full-body, colorful racing gear, including helmets, are seen on the path, where they run towards each other and embrace.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The description of the shot size change is inaccurate. The caption states the shot \"widen[s] to a medium full shot,\" but the camera's field of view does not change. Instead, the subject from the middle ground moves into the foreground to join the first subject. The resulting shot is a medium shot that now includes both men embracing, not a medium full shot (which typically shows subjects from the knees up). The phrase \"causing the shot to widen to a medium full shot\" should be revised to accurately describe the final composition, for example: \"the two men embrace in the center of the frame, with the framing remaining a medium shot that now contains both subjects.\"",
