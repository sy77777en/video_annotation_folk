    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot that frames the orange anthropomorphic creature in the middle ground, often positioned near the center or slightly off-center of the frame as it leaps and stretches across the scene. The camera remains below the subject, looking upward, which emphasizes the character’s elongated limbs and dynamic poses. Surrounding objects such as the black grand piano, trash bin, fire hydrant, park bench, and streetlight are distributed across the left, right, and bottom areas of the frame, occupying both the foreground and middle ground. Industrial elements like pipes, a railway bridge, and a construction crane are mostly in the background, stretching from the left to the right edges and sometimes intersecting the middle ground. As the subject moves, the camera smoothly tracks its motion, shifting the subject’s position from center to left or right, while the surrounding objects and structures appear to float or tumble, creating a sense of shifting perspective and spatial disorientation. The background remains filled with abstract, watercolor-like splotches, providing a static yet visually complex backdrop to the moving elements in the foreground and middle ground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The primary subject is a thin, orange, anthropomorphic creature with long limbs, large feet, a long snout, and two tufts of black hair on its head. This character, which has a lighter yellow patch on its stomach and wears a yellow bra-like top, is shown in various dynamic, mid-air poses. The scene also contains numerous inanimate objects, including a black grand piano, a gray cylindrical metal trash bin, a red fire hydrant, and a black park bench. Industrial structures are also present, such as a complex assembly of gray pipes with valves, the black silhouette of a large construction crane with a hook, a section of a gray metal railway bridge with wooden planks, and a standard traffic light. Additionally, an ornate, black streetlight with a glowing yellow lamp appears in the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This animated video depicts a chaotic, stylized urban landscape set against a background of purple, pink, and teal watercolor-like splotches. The scene is filled with tumbling and floating objects, including the black silhouettes of construction cranes, fragmented walkways, and abstract building shapes. A complex network of dark pipes, a black grand piano, a park bench, a red fire hydrant, and a trash can are also seen moving through the disorienting, shifting perspective. An orange, cartoonish creature navigates this dynamic and fragmented industrial setting.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video opens with a wide shot of a surreal comic scene scattered with objects like a piano, trash bin, pipelines, streetlights, and train rails. The camera tracks an unconventional man-like subject jumping across these elements, emphasizing its erratic movements with smooth tracking motion.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned below the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is mostly accurate but can be improved for precision and adherence to objectivity. The description of the camera as \"remain[ing] below the subject\" is an oversimplification; the camera maintains a low-angle perspective, but the entire frame, including the viewpoint, tumbles and rotates throughout the shot. The caption should describe this tumbling motion. Additionally, several phrases are interpretive rather than descriptive, such as \"which emphasizes the character’s elongated limbs and dynamic poses,\" \"creating a sense of shifting perspective and spatial disorientation,\" and \"visually complex backdrop.\" These should be removed or rephrased to describe the visual facts more directly. For instance, instead of describing the *effect* of the tumbling, simply state that the scene and its elements rotate. Finally, the description of the subject's movement as shifting \"from center to left or right\" is too general; it should specify that the character moves from the center towards the top and then settles on the left side of the frame.",
