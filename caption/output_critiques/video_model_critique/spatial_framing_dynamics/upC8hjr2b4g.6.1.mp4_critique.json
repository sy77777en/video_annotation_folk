    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot, framing a male figure slightly to the right of the center in the middle ground. The background is entirely black. The shot then transitions to a medium close-up, maintaining the figure's position slightly to the right of the center in the middle ground. Throughout the video, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man with short, dark, neatly styled hair and a featureless, smooth, light-skinned face. He is wearing gold-rimmed, round glasses and small, light-colored earbuds in both ears. His attire consists of a light-colored, button-up shirt, a dark blue belt with a silver buckle, and a light-colored, open overshirt or lab coat. The man is standing, facing slightly to his right (viewer's left), with his head slightly tilted down, against a black background. He is illuminated from the front, creating a subtle glow around his form.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a static, objective POV shot of a faceless male figure positioned against a completely black background. The figure, seemingly a 3D render, has black, neatly styled hair and wears gold-rimmed glasses and small, light-colored earbuds. He is dressed in a light blue, button-up shirt, a dark blue belt with a silver buckle, and a white, open overshirt or light jacket. The figure is illuminated from the front, creating a soft glow around its silhouette, particularly on the white overshirt, while the rest of the scene remains in darkness. In the lower left corner of the frame, there is an overlay text displaying \"[16],\" adding a subtle element to the otherwise minimalistic setting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the initial and final shot sizes and the subject's position. However, it describes the change in shot size as a static transition (\"The shot then transitions to a medium close-up\") rather than describing the continuous movement that occurs. The video features a slow, continuous zoom-in. The description should be revised to specify that the camera slowly zooms in, which is a key aspect of the shot's spatial dynamics.",
