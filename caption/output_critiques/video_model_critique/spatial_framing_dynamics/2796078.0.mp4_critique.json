    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of a woman holding a fluffy dog, capturing them from the waist up. Initially, the woman and dog are centered in the frame, with the woman facing away from the camera. They occupy the foreground, while the background features a modern building with large glass windows and two men standing near it. As the video progresses, the camera pans slightly to the left, keeping the woman and dog in the center but shifting the background to include more of the outdoor seating area with wooden and metal furniture. The woman turns her head to the right, revealing her profile, while the dog remains in her arms. The camera maintains its position at the subject's level throughout, ensuring a consistent perspective. The greenery and potted plants remain in the background, enhancing the outdoor setting. The transition between initial and final frames is smooth, with the primary focus remaining on the woman and dog as they move slightly within the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a woman with curly brown hair, wearing a beige coat, holding a fluffy, light brown dog. The dog is wearing a blue and white bandana with small patterns around its neck. The woman is seen from different angles, with her hair partially tied back. The setting includes outdoor seating and greenery, suggesting a casual, outdoor environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The camera showcases an outdoor urban setting. It initially showing a modern building with large glass windows, where two men are standing outside. As it trucks left, the scene transitions naturally to another modern building, likely a café or social space, also featuring large glass windows that reveal people inside. The exterior includes wooden and metal furniture, such as tables and chairs, arranged on a paved surface. The scene is lively, with people casually interacting in the background. A notable visual element is a person holding a fluffy, curly-haired dog adorned with a blue bandana, adding a touch of warmth and companionship to the scene. The setting is enhanced by greenery, including potted plants and trees, contributing to a relaxed and inviting atmosphere.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good for this video. While it correctly identifies some elements, it contains significant inaccuracies and omissions regarding the spatial dynamics and movement, which are the core requirements of the instruction.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   **Inaccurate Description of Movement:** The caption states the camera \"pans slightly\" and the subjects \"move slightly within the frame.\" This is incorrect. The woman is actively walking from right to left, and the camera performs a continuous pan to follow her movement across a significant portion of the patio. The movement is the primary dynamic of the shot, not a slight adjustment.\n*   **Inaccurate Description of Background Elements:** The caption says, \"The greenery and potted plants remain in the background.\" This is false. The video begins with a building entrance in the background. The greenery, plants, and outdoor furniture only appear in the background as the woman walks and the camera pans left. They do not \"remain\" there throughout.\n\n### Completeness\n\n*   **Missing Key Action:** The caption fails to mention a notable action by the dog. Around the 00:02 mark, the dog turns its head to look directly toward the camera, a key moment that changes its orientation within the scene.\n*   **Vague Subject Movement:** The description of the woman's movement is too vague. A complete description would specify that she walks from the right side of the scene toward the left while the camera tracks her.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Strengths:** The caption successfully follows some instructions. It correctly identifies the shot size (\"medium shot\"), the subjects' initial 2D and 3D positions (\"centered,\" \"foreground\"), and the camera height (\"at the subject's level\"). It is also a single paragraph and avoids speculative language.\n*   **Weaknesses:** The primary failure is its inability to accurately describe the \"spatial framing and dynamics\" and \"any changes,\" as requested. The mischaracterization of the pan and the subject's movement, along with the incorrect statement about the background, makes the description misleading and unreliable. The use of \"fluffy\" is a minor subjective descriptor but is less problematic than the factual errors in movement.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This medium, eye-level shot follows a woman holding a small, light-brown poodle-mix dog. Initially, the woman's back is to the camera, and they are centered in the foreground in front of a building's glass entrance. The woman then walks from right to left across an outdoor patio, and the camera pans left to track her movement, keeping the subjects centered. As she moves, the background transitions to reveal an outdoor seating area with tables, chairs, and potted flowers. Around the 00:02 mark, the dog, which is wearing a bandana, turns its head to look toward the camera. The woman also turns her head slightly to her right, revealing her profile as she continues walking leftward through the space.",
