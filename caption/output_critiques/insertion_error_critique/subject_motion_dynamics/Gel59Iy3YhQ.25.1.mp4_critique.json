    "pre_caption": "In a pixelated, black-and-white scene, a character with light-colored hair and a flying device gets up from the ground on the right, jumps, and ascends to a platform above. Simultaneously, a ninja-like character on the left gets up, runs right, and jumps onto the same platform. The light-haired character runs left and performs an aerial attack, knocking the ninja off the platform to the right. After the light-haired character jumps down, the ninja gets up and attacks, knocking them back. The light-haired character then gets up and flies back onto the platform, followed by the ninja who jumps up. The light-haired character attacks again, knocking the ninja off the platform to the left, before jumping down once more.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the main subjects in this video exhibit **atypical motion, posture, or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **In a black-and-white, pixelated scene, a small character resembling a ninja is depicted wearing a dark headband. This figure is positioned near several other characters who appear to be SWAT officers, identifiable by their dark, bulky tactical gear and helmets. Also present are two armored trucks, rendered in the same pixelated style, with the word \"SWAT\" written in white capital letters on their sides. Scattered across the ground are several SWAT officers who have fallen during a battle with the ninja. In the center of the image, there's also a character with light-colored hair and twintails, floating in the air with a flying device on their back.**",

As the scene progresses, two SWAT trucks drive in from both sides, and several SWAT officers get off each truck.

The ninja and several SWAT officers gather at the bottom ground to fight. The ninja character first moves to the right and kills the SWAT officer on the right, then jumps and moves to the left to kill the SWAT officer on the left. Finally, all the SWAT officers are knocked down, and the ninja is in the middle of the ground. At this time, the character with the flying device above is directly above the ninja.
