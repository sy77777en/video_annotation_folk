    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up of an elderly man with white hair styled in a bun, secured with a pin, and a long white beard, wearing traditional Chinese robes. The camera gradually pulls back, revealing more of the background, which appears to be an indoor setting with wooden structures and dim lighting. As the camera continues to pull back, two other individuals come into view, standing in front of the elderly man and holding swords pointed at him. The two individuals are also dressed in traditional Chinese robes, and their upper bodies and partial heads are visible. The scene creates a sense of tension, with the elderly man at the center and the two individuals framing him.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features an elderly man with white hair styled in a bun, secured with a pin, and long eyebrows, wearing traditional Chinese robes. He is positioned centrally and faces forward with a serious expression. The camera initially focuses on him in a medium close-up shot. As the camera zooms out, two other people appear in the foreground, partially visible from behind. They frame the elderly man in the gap between them. The two individuals in the foreground are dressed in dark traditional Chinese robes, and one of them appears to have a sword held on their back. Their upper bodies and partial heads are visible, suggesting they are facing the elderly man. The scene creates a sense of focus on the elderly man, framed by the two figures.**",
