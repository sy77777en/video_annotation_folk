    "pre_caption": "From a top-down perspective, a white aiming line sweeps across the golf course, adjusting the projected path of the shot. After the aim is set, a power meter at the bottom of the screen fills with a red bar, and an accuracy marker slides back along it. The golf ball is then struck, launching into the air and flying in an arc over a body of water before landing in a sand trap.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **This video showcases the gameplay of a pixel-art golf video game from a top-down perspective. The user interface displays information for the 2nd hole, a 650-yard Par 5. In the top left corner, a small avatar of a man with brown hair and a green shirt is shown next to his score of \"E\" and rank of \"2ND.\" The course itself is rendered with green trees, blue water, light brown sand traps, a striped green fairway, and a large area of blue land. A small, pixelated golfer character in a green shirt and brown pants is shown aiming a shot, with a white line indicating the ball's projected path. As the aim is adjusted, the distance to a red flag marker changes. The interface also includes a wind indicator, a slope indicator, a club selection menu showing \"DRIVER\" and \"PRO WOODS,\" and a long power meter at the bottom. In the bottom right corner, a large, white golf ball sits on a tee. The sequence shows the player aiming and then hitting the ball, which travels across the course.**",
