As the camera moves to the right, a red house with a lit lantern on a post and some sleds leaning against it comes into view. The camera continues to pan right, revealing more of the red house and additional sleds. Further movement reveals a small, lit Christmas tree near the house and a signpost. The camera then shows more of the snowy area, including another building with a lit Christmas tree and a parking area with several vehicles.",
