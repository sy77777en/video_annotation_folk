    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up aerial view of a coastal area featuring a white lighthouse with a red top, surrounded by a few buildings, including a red-roofed house and a small structure with a red roof. The camera gradually moves backward, revealing more of the coastline, which is lined with rocks and a sandy beach. As the camera continues to pull back, the surrounding landscape becomes visible, showing a dense forest extending into the distance. The sea is calm, with gentle waves lapping against the shore. A tall structure, possibly a communication tower, is seen near the forest. The camera movement is smooth and steady, providing a comprehensive view of the coastal landscape, the lighthouse, the buildings, and the natural surroundings.",
