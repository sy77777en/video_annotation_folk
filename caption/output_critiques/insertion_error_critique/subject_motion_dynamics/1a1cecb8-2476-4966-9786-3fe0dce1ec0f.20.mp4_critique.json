    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a view of a street intersection, showing a 'One Way' sign, a 'No Turn on Red' sign, and a traffic light displaying a yellow hand signal. A woman with pink hair and a black mask is walking on the sidewalk. The camera then pans to the right, revealing more of the sidewalk, a tree with pink blossoms, and a street with parked cars. As the camera continues to move, it captures a red car driving on the road and a black car approaching the intersection. The camera further pans to show a black car turning at the intersection, with a red car and a white car also visible on the road. The video ends with a view of the intersection, showing the black car completing its turn and other vehicles waiting at the traffic light.",
