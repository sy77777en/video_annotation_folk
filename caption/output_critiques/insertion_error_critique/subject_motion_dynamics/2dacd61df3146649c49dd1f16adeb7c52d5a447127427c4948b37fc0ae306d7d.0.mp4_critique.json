The floor is dirty and scattered with debris, and the corridor is lined with windows on the right side, allowing some natural light to filter in. As the camera moves forward, more details of the corridor become visible, including broken windows and more graffiti. The camera continues to move forward, revealing more debris and damage along the walls, including peeling paint and additional graffiti. The corridor appears to be in a state of disrepair, with some sections of the floor and walls showing significant wear and tear.
