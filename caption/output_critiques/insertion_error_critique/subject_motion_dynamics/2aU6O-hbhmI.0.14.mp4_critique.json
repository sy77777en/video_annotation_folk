    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a view of a cityscape at dusk, featuring a construction site with buildings and cranes in the background. The camera starts to tilt upward, gradually revealing more of the cityscape and the construction site below. As the camera continues to move upward, the construction site becomes more prominent, with visible structures and equipment. The camera keeps tilting upward, showing a broader view of the construction site and the surrounding buildings, with the sky transitioning from dusk to night. The video concludes with a wide view of the construction site and the cityscape, with the sun setting in the background, casting a warm glow over the scene.",
