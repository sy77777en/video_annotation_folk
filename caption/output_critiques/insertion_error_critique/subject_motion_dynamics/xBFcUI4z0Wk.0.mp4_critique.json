    "pre_caption": "The video shows two race cars, one white with the number 98 and another black and yellow with the number 2, involved in a collision on a race track. The white car, marked with a blue 'Ford' logo, has visible damage to its front bumper and is positioned on the grass next to the track. The black and yellow car, marked with 'Gimme Country,' is also damaged and trailing smoke, positioned slightly behind and to the left of the white car. Both cars are next to the track, indicating a recent impact, and their proximity highlights the aftermath of a high-speed racing event.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the motion and dynamics of the main subject while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects' movements.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video showcases two main race cars on a track, both involved in a collision. The primary focus is on a white race car with a red number 98 prominently displayed on its side, featuring black designs on its rear and a blue \"Ford\" logo. This car has visible damage to its front bumper and is positioned adjacent to the track on the grass. The secondary subject is a black and yellow race car with the number 2, which is also damaged and trailing smoke, positioned slightly behind and to the left of the first car. Both cars are next to the track, indicating a recent impact, and their proximity highlights the aftermath of a high-speed racing event.**",
