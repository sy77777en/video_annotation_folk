    "pre_caption": "This is an interior scenery shot capturing the opulent and reverent atmosphere of a grand European church or cathedral. The camera slowly pans across the vast space, revealing a stunning display of architectural and artistic detail, from massive, dark marble columns and sections of exposed red brick to the elaborate white marble sculptures and reliefs adorning the walls. The primary focus is a deeply recessed chapel or apse, crowned with a magnificent, gilded dome featuring intricate patterns and figures. Below, a large, dramatic altarpiece painting is enshrined within an elaborate white marble framework, set above what appears to be a reliquary. There is no main subject, as the video's purpose is to immerse the viewer in the overwhelming scale, historical grandeur, and sacred ambiance of the environment itself, with ornate lanterns casting a warm glow that highlights the rich textures throughout the space.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
