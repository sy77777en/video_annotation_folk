    "pre_caption": "This video presents an architectural scenery shot of a sterile and unsettling liminal space, specifically a long, narrow corridor filled with murky, greenish water. The walls are uniformly covered in small, pale green tiles, and the scene is illuminated by rows of bright, square lights recessed into the ceiling, casting a cold glow that reflects on the water's surface. The camera begins with a blurred, close-up view of a dark, arched opening at the water's edge before slowly pulling back to reveal the full, empty expanse of the hallway, which culminates in a distant doorway and steps. There is no main subject, as the focus is entirely on the eerie and isolating atmosphere of the environment. The composition and slow reveal are designed to evoke a sense of unease, making the space itself the central point of interest.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
