    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dynamic cityscape scenery shot captured from the Brooklyn Bridge, looking towards the Manhattan skyline during the twilight hour. There is no single main subject, as the composition emphasizes the grand scale and bustling atmosphere of the urban environment. The intricate steel structure and suspension cables of the bridge frame the scene, leading the eye towards the distant skyscrapers silhouetted against a soft, pastel-hued sky. Below, on the bridge's roadway, the movement of traffic is captured with a long exposure effect, transforming the vehicles' headlights and taillights into continuous, glowing streaks of red and white light that contrast with the darkening city. A solitary figure is visible on the elevated pedestrian walkway to the right, dwarfed by the immense scale of the bridge and the sprawling metropolis beyond.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
