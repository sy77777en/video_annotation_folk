    "pre_caption": "This video presents a suburban scenery shot, capturing a magnificent double rainbow arching across a gray, overcast sky. The primary rainbow is bright and distinct, while a second, fainter arc is visible above it. The scene is framed by elements of a residential neighborhood, including lush green trees, a prominent palm tree on the right, a concrete fence, and power lines stretching across the view. The focus is not on a specific subject but on the overall atmosphere and the natural beauty of the rainbow, with the street-level environment serving as a familiar foreground to the celestial display.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
