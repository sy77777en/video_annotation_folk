    "pre_caption": "This is an interior architectural scenery shot. The video depicts a large, sterile, white-tiled room containing several pools of dark, rippling water. Bright, even illumination emanates from rows of fluorescent lights on the ceiling and walls, their reflections shimmering on the water's surface. Prominent white cylindrical pillars stand within the main body of water. The camera slowly navigates this space, highlighting its expansive and somewhat unsettling emptiness. There is no main subject because the focus is on the liminal, dreamlike quality of the environment itself, its scale, and the eerie ambiance created by the stark white surfaces, reflective water, and uniform bright lighting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text.",
