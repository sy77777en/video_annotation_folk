    "pre_caption": "This video presents a low-angle cityscape scenery shot, capturing the grand facade of a classical-style stone building. The structure, identified by a banner as the Chicago Cultural Center, features a series of large, arched windows and ornate stonework, with a taller, more modern skyscraper visible in the distance behind it. The scene is bathed in the muted, greenish-yellow light of an overcast sky, creating a somber and imposing atmosphere. There is no main subject, as the focus is on establishing a sense of place and conveying the monumental scale of the urban architecture rather than highlighting a specific person or object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
