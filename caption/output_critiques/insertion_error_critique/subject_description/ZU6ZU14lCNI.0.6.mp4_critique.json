    "pre_caption": "This video presents an architectural scenery shot, looking up at the interior of a grand building's ornate dome. The dome features a large, circular stained-glass skylight with a grid pattern and a greenish tint, illuminated from above or within, and is surrounded by intricate, decorative plasterwork and a ring of small lights. A large, multi-tiered chandelier hangs down from the center below the skylight. There is no main subject because the focus is intentionally broad, capturing the overall grandeur, intricate details, and atmosphere of the architectural space itself, emphasizing the environment and scale rather than a specific person or object within it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
