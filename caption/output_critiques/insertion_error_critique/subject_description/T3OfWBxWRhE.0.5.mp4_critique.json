    "pre_caption": "This is a dramatic cityscape scenery shot of London, centered on the iconic Elizabeth Tower, commonly known as Big Ben. The tall clock tower stands prominently against a moody, teal-colored sky filled with streaked, fast-moving clouds. To the left, the ornate Gothic architecture of the Palace of Westminster extends into the frame, while on the right, blurred red double-decker buses suggest the constant motion of city traffic. The video lacks a main subject because its focus is on capturing the grand scale and atmospheric quality of the environment, using the famous landmarks to establish a powerful sense of place.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
