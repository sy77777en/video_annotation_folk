    "pre_caption": "This video captures a vibrant cityscape time-lapse of a Parisian street corner at night, likely near Place Vendôme, identifiable by the prominent column in the background. The scene is imbued with a festive atmosphere, featuring a glowing Christmas tree on a corner and grand, historic buildings with warmly lit windows, one of which is adorned with a massive, golden sunburst sculpture. There is no single main subject, as the time-lapse technique intentionally blurs individual elements like cars and people to emphasize the overall environment and its dynamic energy. This is achieved through the long exposure, which transforms the movement of traffic into brilliant red and white light trails that streak across the reflective pavement, creating a visual spectacle that makes the city's lively pulse the true focus of the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
