    "pre_caption": "This video presents a tranquil residential scenery shot, capturing a quiet, modern Japanese suburban street on a rainy day. The asphalt road is slick and reflective from the rain, mirroring the overcast sky. On both sides of the narrow street, contemporary houses with clean lines and dark or neutral-colored facades are visible, with cars like a prominent red Mini Cooper and a black Toyota Prius parked neatly in designated spaces and under carports. There is no main subject in the video; the focus is instead on the serene and slightly melancholic atmosphere created by the steady rain and the quiet, orderly environment of the neighborhood.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
