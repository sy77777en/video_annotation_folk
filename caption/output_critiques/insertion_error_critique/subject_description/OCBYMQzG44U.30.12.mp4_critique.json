    "pre_caption": "This is an interior scenery shot of a large, sterile, and empty room, captured with a slow pan that reveals more of the space. The floor is covered in small white tiles, with a large rectangular area in the center made of glossy black tiles. The lower portion of the walls is a dark, textured material, while the upper walls and ceiling are white, illuminated by several small recessed lights and one large, circular light fixture. An arched doorway is visible in the back wall. There is no main subject; the focus is entirely on the unsettling, liminal atmosphere and the stark, geometric design of the environment itself, making the empty space the point of interest.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
