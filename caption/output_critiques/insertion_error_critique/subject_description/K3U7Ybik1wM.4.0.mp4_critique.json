    "pre_caption": "This is a landscape scenery shot depicting a dramatic twilight sky over a rural setting. The focus is on the atmospheric quality of the environment rather than a specific subject, using the vastness of the sky to create a sense of scale and mood. The scene is dominated by a deep blue-grey sky filled with dark, heavy clouds. Near the horizon, the last light of the setting sun casts a soft orange and pink glow. Two long, thin contrails, brightly illuminated by the sun, streak across the upper portion of the sky in a vibrant orange hue. In the foreground, the dark silhouettes of several trees, including tall evergreens and a large, leafy deciduous tree, stand in stark contrast against the colorful twilight.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
