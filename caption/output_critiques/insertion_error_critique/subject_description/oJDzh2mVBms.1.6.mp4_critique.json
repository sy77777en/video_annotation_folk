    "pre_caption": "This video presents a majestic landscape scenery shot captured from a low angle within a snow-covered forest. The night sky is dominated by a spectacular display of the aurora borealis, with brilliant, swirling curtains of vibrant green light stretching across the expanse. Silhouetted against this celestial phenomenon are the dark spires of numerous evergreen trees and the bare branches of a deciduous tree, their forms adding depth and scale to the scene. The composition intentionally lacks a single main subject; instead, the focus is on the overwhelming beauty and grandeur of the natural environment, creating an atmosphere of awe and wonder.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
