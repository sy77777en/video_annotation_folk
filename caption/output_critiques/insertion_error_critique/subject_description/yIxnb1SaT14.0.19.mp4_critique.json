    "pre_caption": "This video presents a time-lapse cityscape scenery shot from a high-angle perspective overlooking a Paris Métro station. There is no main subject, as the focus is on capturing the atmosphere and the constant flow of movement within the urban environment. The technique of blurring the motion of commuters and the departure of a green and white train emphasizes the transient nature of the scene over any individual element. The station itself is characterized by its classic vaulted, white-tiled ceiling and walls, with two platforms flanking the central tracks. As the train pulls away, it reveals the dark, intricate network of rails, while advertisements, including prominent ones for \"MAUBOUSSIN\" and \"PRINTEMPS,\" line the walls, adding a layer of commercial context to the public space.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
