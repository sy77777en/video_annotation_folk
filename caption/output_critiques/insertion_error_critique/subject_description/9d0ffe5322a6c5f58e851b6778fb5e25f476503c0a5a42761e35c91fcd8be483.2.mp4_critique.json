    "pre_caption": "This video presents a panoramic cityscape scenery shot, capturing the tranquil beauty of a sunset. There is no main subject, as the focus is on conveying the overall atmosphere and the grand scale of the natural light display against the urban backdrop. The camera slowly pans to the right, revealing a vast sky filled with scattered clouds illuminated in warm hues of orange, yellow, and gold by the setting sun. Below, the city is reduced to a dark silhouette of buildings and trees, with the brilliant orb of the sun gradually emerging from behind the treeline on the right, casting a final, radiant glow across the horizon.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
