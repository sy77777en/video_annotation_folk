    "pre_caption": "This is a tranquil cityscape scenery shot capturing a massive, illuminated suspension bridge spanning a wide body of water at dusk. The bridge's long deck is lined with evenly spaced lights, and its towering support structures are also lit, all casting a warm, golden reflection on the calm surface of the water below. In the foreground, the dark, wet silhouette of a rocky or muddy shoreline is visible, while the sky above fades from a deep, dusky orange and blue near the horizon to complete darkness. The video lacks a specific main subject, as the static, wide composition is intended to capture the serene atmosphere and the grand scale of the architectural marvel against the twilight sky. The focus is on the peaceful interplay between the man-made lights and the natural environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
