    "pre_caption": "This is a scenery shot of an informational sign at a zoo, positioned in front of an animal enclosure. The camera remains static, focusing on the light-colored sign which provides details about the \"Indian Rhinoceros\" (Rhinoceros unicornis) in multiple languages, complete with a habitat map and a photograph of the animal. Behind the sign, the enclosure features a dirt ground, a low concrete wall, a series of thick blue-gray posts, and a large pile of dark rocks, all surrounded by patches of green grass and trees. The video lacks a main subject as its purpose is to present the static, informational context of the zoo environment, focusing on the descriptive sign rather than any specific animal or action within the enclosure.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
