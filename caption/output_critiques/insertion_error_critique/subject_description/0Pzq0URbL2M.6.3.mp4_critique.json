    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dramatic scenery shot capturing the destruction of a building. The focus is on the powerful event and the resulting atmosphere rather than a specific subject. The scale of the fiery explosion serves as the visual centerpiece, emphasizing the action and its environmental impact. The sequence shows a large, two-story brick warehouse at dusk being consumed by a massive explosion, which begins as an overwhelming white flash before transitioning into multiple fiery bursts erupting from the windows and roof, ultimately shrouding the structure in thick, dark smoke against the twilight sky.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
