    "pre_caption": "This video is a time-lapse landscape scenery shot capturing the progression of dawn over a vast, snow-covered environment. The scene begins in the deep blue of twilight, with the sky gradually lightening as warm orange and pink tones appear on the horizon, backlighting a distant, dark line of evergreen trees. Wispy clouds drift across the expansive sky, catching the emerging sunlight. In the foreground, a wide, flat field of pristine white snow stretches out, with two simple, light-colored, boxy buildings nestled in snowdrifts on the left. There is no single main subject, as the composition emphasizes the atmospheric transformation and the immense scale of the cold landscape, focusing on the changing light and the serene, stark beauty of the setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
