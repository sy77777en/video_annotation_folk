    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dramatic cityscape scenery shot, capturing a sprawling metropolis under attack from an aerial perspective. The scene is dominated by towering skyscrapers under a hazy, golden sky, with a distant skyline visible across a body of water. Throughout the urban grid, multiple explosions erupt at street level, sending plumes of dark smoke billowing upwards, while faint white streaks arc down from the sky. The focus is not on a single subject but on the vast scale of the city and the widespread chaos, emphasizing the environmental destruction rather than a specific focal point.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
