    "pre_caption": "This is a wide-angle seascape scenery shot captured from the bow of a massive container ship. Stacks of red, blue, and orange shipping containers fill the lower portion of the frame, leading the eye forward as the vessel moves through calm, dark blue waters. In the distance, a hazy coastline with low-lying mountains and a faint city skyline, including a long-span bridge, is visible on the horizon under a vast, bright blue sky that fades to white at the top. There is no main subject in this video; the focus is on conveying the immense scale of the maritime environment and the feeling of a journey across the open sea, using the ship as a framing device to emphasize the vastness of the surrounding seascape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
