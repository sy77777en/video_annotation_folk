    "pre_caption": "The video is a waterfront landscape scenery shot, capturing a wide expanse of choppy water under a hazy, overcast sky with the sun faintly visible through the clouds. The distant shoreline is lined with indistinct, silhouetted buildings, their outlines softened by the mist, while the foreground features stone steps and platforms partially submerged by gentle waves. There is no main subject in this video, as the focus is on the overall atmosphere and scale of the environment, emphasizing the interplay between water, light, and distant architecture rather than highlighting any specific object or individual.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
