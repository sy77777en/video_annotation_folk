    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dynamic rural scenery shot, capturing a rapid, first-person journey along a dirt path through the countryside. The path is flanked by vibrant green fields and lined with lush, leafy trees under a bright blue sky dotted with a few white clouds and a brilliant sun. In the distance, several houses are visible on a gentle slope. The video lacks a main subject because its fast-paced perspective and significant motion blur are designed to immerse the viewer in the experience of moving through the landscape, emphasizing the atmosphere and sense of speed over any particular object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
