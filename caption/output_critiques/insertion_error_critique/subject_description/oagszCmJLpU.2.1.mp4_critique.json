    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dramatic landscape scenery shot, focusing on the vast scale of a desert environment and the atmospheric spectacle above it, rather than a singular main subject. The focus is on capturing the immense and dynamic beauty of the natural world itself. The scene is set across a wide expanse of rolling sand dunes dotted with sparse, low-lying green scrub. Dominating the view is a breathtaking timelapse of the sky, where a massive formation of textured mammatus clouds undergoes a spectacular color transformation. Initially illuminated in fiery oranges and yellows by the setting sun, the clouds shift into brilliant shades of pink and magenta, eventually deepening into rich purples as twilight descends and the upper sky turns a clear, dark blue.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
