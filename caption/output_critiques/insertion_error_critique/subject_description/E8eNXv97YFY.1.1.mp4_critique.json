    "pre_caption": "This video captures a dramatic cityscape scenery shot, featuring a large, reddish-brown stone monument with a multi-tiered, pagoda-style roof. The monument is centrally framed against a dynamic, time-lapse sky filled with dark, fast-moving clouds that partially obscure a bright, hazy sun. In the background, a modern city skyline with several buildings provides a contrasting backdrop. There is no single main subject, as the shot's composition emphasizes the overall atmosphere and grand scale, focusing on the relationship between the imposing monument, the turbulent sky, and the surrounding urban environment rather than on a specific object or person.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
