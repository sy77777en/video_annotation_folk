    "pre_caption": "This video presents a cityscape scenery shot from a street corner in Japan under a bright blue sky with fluffy white clouds. A red taxi and a white truck drive along a paved road lined with green hedges and trees, with modern apartment buildings and traditional Japanese-style structures visible in the background. The camera tilts upward to focus on a large blue overhead road sign, which provides directions in both Japanese and English for destinations such as Otsu, Yamashinahigashino, and Shimogamo, along with route numbers. The focus of the shot is on the overall urban environment and the sense of place, rather than on any single vehicle or building. The camera's upward movement from the bustling street to the directional sign emphasizes the location and atmosphere of this specific intersection.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
