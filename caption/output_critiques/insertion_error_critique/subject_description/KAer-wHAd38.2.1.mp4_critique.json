    "pre_caption": "This video captures a landscape scenery shot of a tranquil rural environment. A straight, light-colored concrete road stretches into the distance, flanked on both sides by vast, vibrant green rice paddies. The road is lined with simple, modern streetlights and small, newly planted trees. In the background, rolling green hills and mountains sit under a bright blue sky filled with large, fluffy white cumulus clouds. There is no main subject in this video, as the camera's steady forward movement along the road emphasizes the expansive scale and peaceful atmosphere of the countryside rather than focusing on a specific object or person.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
