    "pre_caption": "This video captures an aerial cityscape scenery shot of Venice, Italy, during a spectacular sunrise. There is no single main subject; instead, the focus is on the grand scale and atmospheric beauty of the environment. The camera glides over St. Mark's Square, showcasing the iconic Doge's Palace, a grand building of white stone with distinctive Gothic arches and a loggia. Prominently featured is the Column of the Lion of Venice, a tall, slender pillar topped with a bronze statue of a winged lion. The warm, golden light of the rising sun bathes the scene, illuminating the historic architecture and reflecting off the calm water of the Venetian Lagoon, where numerous dark gondolas are neatly moored along the waterfront.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
