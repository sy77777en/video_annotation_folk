    "pre_caption": "This is an airport scenery shot captured at dusk, characterized by a muted, teal-toned color palette. In the foreground, a blurry barbed-wire fence separates the viewer from the airfield where a prominent red and white lattice radar tower stands, its long, rectangular antenna slowly rotating. Beyond the tower and an empty runway, a sprawling cityscape with another, smaller tower stretches towards a line of hazy, rolling hills under a pale, overcast sky. The shot lacks a single main subject; its static, wide composition instead emphasizes the overall environment and atmosphere, creating a sense of scale and place.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
