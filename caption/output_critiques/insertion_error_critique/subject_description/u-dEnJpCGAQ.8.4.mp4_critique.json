    "pre_caption": "This video presents a landscape scenery shot, capturing a serene, dark-water lake nestled within a lush, green forest. The still surface of the lake reflects the sky and the dense foliage that lines its shores, while a large, forest-covered mountain looms in the background under a bright sky. The scene is framed by vibrant green leaves and branches in the foreground, creating a sense of depth and perspective. There is no single main subject, as the focus is intentionally placed on the expansive and tranquil atmosphere of the natural environment, emphasizing the scale and pristine beauty of the remote location.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
