    "pre_caption": "This video is an aerial landscape scenery shot that glides alongside a majestic, conical mountain peak covered in a dense, lush green forest. Thick, white clouds and fog swirl around the mountain's base and sides, creating a serene and ethereal \"sea of clouds\" effect, with the tips of other distant peaks visible in the background under a bright, overcast sky. There is no main subject because the focus is on capturing the grand scale and atmospheric mood of the environment, emphasizing the vastness of nature rather than a specific object or entity.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
