    "pre_caption": "This video presents a natural scenery shot of the open sea. There is no main subject, as the focus is entirely on the vast, textured surface of the water, emphasizing the environment and atmosphere. The deep blue water is covered in a continuous pattern of small, choppy waves that gently rise and fall. A soft, purplish-pink light, likely from a sunrise or sunset just out of frame, reflects off the crests of the waves, creating a subtle contrast with the darker troughs and lending a serene quality to the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
