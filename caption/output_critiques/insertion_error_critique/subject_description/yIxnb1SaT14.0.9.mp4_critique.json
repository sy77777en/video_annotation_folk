    "pre_caption": "This video presents a cityscape scenery shot, capturing the majestic facade of the Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris at night. The grand Gothic structure, with its two iconic towers and large rose window, is brilliantly illuminated against a dark, moody sky. In the foreground, a large Christmas tree, densely wrapped in glowing blue and white lights, adds a vibrant, festive element to the scene. The focus is not on a single subject but rather on the overall atmosphere and scale of the environment, using the interplay of architectural grandeur and festive lighting to create a powerful sense of place and occasion.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
