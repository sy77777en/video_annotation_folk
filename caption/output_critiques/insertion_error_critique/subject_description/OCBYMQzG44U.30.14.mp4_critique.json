    "pre_caption": "This is an architectural scenery shot depicting a sterile, minimalist, and expansive interior reminiscent of a liminal pool room. The focus is on the environment and its unsettling atmosphere rather than a specific subject. The camera glides through a space defined by a stark contrast of textures: the lower half of the walls features a dark, mottled, concrete-like surface, while the upper walls and ceiling are covered in small, glossy white tiles. The floor is a geometric pattern of white and black tiles, with the black section suggesting a drained pool. The scene is illuminated by two circular ceiling lights that cast a sterile, slightly greenish glow, creating a dreamlike and eerie ambiance, which is further emphasized by a dark, arched doorway leading into an unknown space in the distance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
