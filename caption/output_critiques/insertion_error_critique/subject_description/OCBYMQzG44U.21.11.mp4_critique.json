    "pre_caption": "This video presents an interior architectural scenery shot, looking down into a swimming pool area. The pool, filled with rippling teal water, is partially encircled by a white spiral staircase featuring a metallic railing. The surrounding walls and floor are covered in white square tiles. A small, indistinct orange object floats in the water. There is no main subject as the focus is on the clean, minimalist architectural design and the serene atmosphere of the aquatic space, rather than any particular entity.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
