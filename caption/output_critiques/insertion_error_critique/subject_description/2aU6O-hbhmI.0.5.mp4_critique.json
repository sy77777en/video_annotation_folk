    "pre_caption": "This video captures a dynamic cityscape scenery shot from a high, sweeping perspective during a vibrant sunset. The camera moves alongside the immense, red lattice structure of a construction crane, which frames the view of a sprawling urban center below. Another crane is visible in the distance, silhouetted against a sky painted with brilliant orange, yellow, and pink clouds that transition to a cool teal color higher up. The scene is filled with a dense collection of modern skyscrapers and buildings, their lights beginning to twinkle as evening approaches. There is no single main subject, as the focus is on the overall atmosphere and the grand scale of the urban environment, using the prominent cranes to emphasize the theme of a city in a state of constant growth and development.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
