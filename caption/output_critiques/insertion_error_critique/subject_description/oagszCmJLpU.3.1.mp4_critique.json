    "pre_caption": "This video captures a dramatic landscape scenery shot, focusing on the immense scale and atmosphere of a powerful weather event rather than a specific main subject. A colossal, dark grey supercell storm cloud dominates the sky, its turbulent, rotating base lowering towards a flat, dark plain. To the right, a heavy rain shaft visibly connects the cloud to the ground, while a stark contrast is created on the left by a break in the clouds, revealing a patch of bright blue sky and brilliantly lit white cloud formations. The overwhelming size of the storm is further emphasized by the tiny silhouettes of a lone tree and a distant, slender tower on the horizon, which serve to highlight the sheer power of the natural spectacle.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
