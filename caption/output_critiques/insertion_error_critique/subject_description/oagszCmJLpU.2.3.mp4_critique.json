    "pre_caption": "This video is a landscape scenery shot capturing a dramatic time-lapse of a powerful thunderstorm over a vast, flat plain as dusk transitions into night. The focus is on the immense scale and atmosphere of the weather event rather than a specific subject. A massive, dark, and turbulent storm cloud dominates the deep blue sky, its interior illuminated by frequent, brilliant flashes of white and purple lightning. As the sequence progresses and the sky darkens, faint stars begin to appear in the clearer sections, while the last vestiges of sunset cast a soft pink glow on smaller, peripheral clouds. Along the distant, dark horizon, a scattering of tiny, bright lights suggests a far-off town or sparse settlement, emphasizing the immense and empty space under the powerful storm.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
