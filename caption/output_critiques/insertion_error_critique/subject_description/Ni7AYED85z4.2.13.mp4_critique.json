    "pre_caption": "The video presents a cityscape scenery shot, capturing a view down a narrow Venetian canal flanked by weathered, multi-story buildings with shuttered windows. The focus is on the overall environment and atmosphere of this iconic urban waterway, rather than a specific object or individual; the moored boats, the distant bridge, and a lone figure walking along the canal's edge contribute to the scene's character but do not serve as a central subject, allowing the viewer to absorb the unique architectural and aquatic setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text.",
