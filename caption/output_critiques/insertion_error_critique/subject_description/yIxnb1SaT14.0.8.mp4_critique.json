    "pre_caption": "The video presents a nighttime cityscape scenery shot. There is no single main subject because the focus is deliberately placed on capturing the overall environment, atmosphere, and scale of the Parisian scene along the River Seine at night. The composition encompasses the river reflecting numerous lights, bordered by illuminated stone embankments and multi-story traditional buildings with glowing windows. In the distance, the iconic Notre Dame Cathedral is prominently featured, illuminated against the dark sky near a bridge, while a brightly lit tour boat with blue decorative lights travels along the water, adding dynamism to the scene rather than being its primary focus. The emphasis is on the collective visual experience and mood of the location rather than highlighting one specific element.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
