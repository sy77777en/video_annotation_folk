    "pre_caption": "This is a landscape scenery shot capturing a long, straight asphalt road that recedes into the horizon. The road, marked by a white center line, cuts through a vast and arid landscape characterized by sandy, light-brown terrain and scattered rocky outcrops under a clear, deep blue sky. There is no distinct main subject; the camera's forward-moving perspective emphasizes the scale and desolation of the environment itself. A lone, silhouetted figure stands far in the distance on the road, serving to accentuate the vastness and isolation of the setting rather than acting as a focal point.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
