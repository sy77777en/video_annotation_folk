    "pre_caption": "This video presents an atmospheric interior scenery shot of a desolate hallway. At the far end, a closed door stands beneath a light fixture that initially bathes the entire corridor in an intense, ominous red glow. This alarming light flickers and then abruptly shuts off, plunging the scene into near-complete darkness. The only remaining illumination is a faint, cool light filtering through a paned window on the left wall, leaving the hallway looking cold and mysterious. The focus is not on a particular subject but on the environment itself, using the dramatic shift from a threatening red to a desolate darkness to build a powerful sense of suspense and unease.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
