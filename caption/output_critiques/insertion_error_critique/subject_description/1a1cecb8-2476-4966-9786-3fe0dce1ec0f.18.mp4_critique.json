    "pre_caption": "This video presents an urban scenery shot of a street corner at dusk. The scene is centered around an intersection with a crosswalk, where a silver sedan and other vehicles pass through. The area is lined with a mix of brick and modern buildings, surrounded by numerous large, leafy trees under an overcast sky, with streetlights already illuminated. There is no main subject, as the camera's wide, panning view is intended to capture the overall atmosphere and environment. The focus is on establishing a sense of place within this campus-like setting rather than highlighting any single person or object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
