    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium-long shot, showing a person partially concealed among tall grass positioned near the center of the frame in the middle ground, while the grass itself dominates the foreground across the lower and middle portions of the frame. In the background, rolling sand dunes and a cloudy sky stretch across the upper part of the frame. The camera is positioned at approximately the same height as the person, level with the grass. As the camera moves forward, the shot transitions to a wide landscape view, with the tall grass receding from the foreground and the person now appearing as a small figure near the center-bottom of the frame in the distant background. The sand dunes and sparse vegetation fill the middle and background, emphasizing the scale of the environment. Throughout the sequence, the camera maintains a low, ground-level perspective, first at the height of the grass and person, then slightly above the terrain as it reveals the broader landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a person dressed in a dark, loose-fitting garment, partially concealed among tall grass, walking away with their back to the camera. As the view shifts, we peer through the grass at a lone figure, likely the same person, appearing in the distance, small in scale against a vast expanse of rolling sand dunes with sparse vegetation. The black-and-white presentation emphasizes the contrast between the figure and the landscape, highlighting the person’s isolation and the openness of the environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place outdoors in a windswept, open landscape dominated by tall, dry grasses and rolling sand dunes under a sky filled with scattered clouds. The environment is rendered in black and white, giving the scene a monochromatic appearance. The grasses in the foreground are thin, upright, and textured, with some bending in the wind, while the dunes in the background have smooth, undulating shapes with visible ridges and patches of vegetation. The lighting suggests daytime, with sunlight casting soft shadows across the terrain. A solitary figure is present, partially obscured by the grasses and later seen as a small silhouette traversing the expansive sandy area, emphasizing the scale of the natural surroundings. No overlays, text, or additional visual elements are present in the video.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: A black-and-white scene shows tall grass swaying in the foreground, with a person partially hidden in the middle of the grass and distant hills under a cloudy sky in the background. The camera then moves forward beyond the tall grass to reveal an expansive black-and-white landscape of rolling sand dunes and sparse vegetation, with a lone figure visible in the distance, emphasizing the vastness of the scene.",
