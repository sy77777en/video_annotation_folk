    "pre_caption": "The video features a close-up shot of a man, capturing him from the shoulders up. He is centrally positioned in the frame, occupying the foreground. His face is in the middle of the frame, with his head slightly tilted forward. The background is dark and out of focus, placing all emphasis on the subject. There are no significant changes in the subject's position or the camera angle throughout the sequence. The camera remains at the subject's eye level, maintaining a consistent perspective. The lighting is dim, casting soft shadows on his face, which enhances the visibility of his features. The overall composition keeps the subject as the focal point, with no other elements or movements in the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man with short, dark curly hair and a light complexion. He has dark eyes, a mustache, and a short beard. He is wearing a dark-colored hoodie with the hood down, making his ears visible. He is facing directly towards the camera with a neutral expression. The lighting is dim, casting soft shadows on his face, which highlights his facial features. His gaze is steady and focused, contributing to a calm and composed appearance.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents an indoor setting with a dimly lit atmosphere, focusing on a single subject. The background is dark, creating a stark contrast with the subject, who is centrally positioned. The lighting is soft, casting subtle shadows and highlighting facial features. The subject wears a dark-colored hoodie, adding to the subdued color palette. The environment is minimalistic, with no visible furniture or props, emphasizing the simplicity and focus on the subject. The overall mood is calm and introspective, with no visible movement or changes in the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
