    "pre_caption": "This medium shot features a woman in the foreground, positioned in the center-right of the frame. In the middle ground, a man stands to her left behind a wooden desk that occupies the lower portion of the frame. On the desk, a lamp, telephone, and service bell are located in the bottom-left quadrant. The background shows a clock centered at the top of the frame, flanked by two wall sconces on the left and right. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level. The shot concludes as the entire image briefly becomes blurry and desaturated.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with long, dark hair and a medium skin tone is in the foreground, facing forward with her mouth slightly open. She wears a form-fitting, brown, leather-like garment with a lace-up front and wide, similarly laced sleeves, complemented by long, white gloves. Both of her hands are raised as she removes her right glove. Behind her and to the left, a man with short, dark, curly hair, a mustache, and a light skin tone stands behind a wooden counter. He is dressed in a brown overcoat over a blue collared shirt and is looking down at the counter. At the end of the video, the entire scene transitions to black and white and becomes quite blurry.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors at a vintage-style reception desk made of dark wood. On the desk's surface sit a brass service bell, a white telephone, and a brass lamp. The background features a strip of dark wood occupying the middle third of the wall, while the rest is covered by dark green wallpaper. A large, round clock with a white face and Roman numerals is mounted on the wall, showing the time as approximately 5:12. The area is dimly illuminated by two warm, triangular wall sconces on either side of the clock. A woman in a brown leather outfit with white gloves is in the foreground, while a man wearing a brown coat stands behind the desk.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
