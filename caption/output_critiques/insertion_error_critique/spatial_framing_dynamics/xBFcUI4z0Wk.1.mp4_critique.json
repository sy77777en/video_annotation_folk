    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot capturing multiple race cars on a track. The damaged car with the number \"98\" is positioned in the foreground, bottom right, on the grass, emitting smoke. The yellow and black car, marked with the number \"2,\" is located slightly behind and to the left of the \"98\" car, also on the grass and emitting smoke. Both cars are in the foreground. In the middle ground, additional race cars, including a blue car and a red car, are seen moving along the track, positioned towards the left side of the frame. The track itself occupies the central portion of the image, with the grassy area surrounding it. The camera remains stationary, positioned above the subjects, providing a clear overhead view of the entire scene. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial positioning throughout the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a dynamic scene involving multiple race cars on a track. The most prominent car, with a white body and red number \"98\" on the side, is positioned on the grass, showing visible damage to its front bumper and emitting smoke, suggesting it may have been involved in a collision or is experiencing a mechanical issue. Nearby, a yellow and black car, marked with the number \"2,\" is partially on the track and grass, also emitting smoke from its rear, indicating a possible collision or mechanical issue. Additional race cars are visible on the track, including a blue car and a red car, both moving at high speed. The scene suggests a high-intensity racing event with cars in various states of motion and distress.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor scene on a racetrack during a race, likely at night, as indicated by the artificial lighting illuminating the area. The setting features a wide asphalt track wrapping around a grassy area, with a concrete barrier bordering the track. Several race cars are visible, with two cars prominently positioned at the intersection of the track and the grass, showing signs of damage. The remaining cars continue racing normally. The cars are colorful, with visible sponsor logos and numbers, and they are in motion, creating a dynamic atmosphere with tire smoke and skid marks on the track. The environment is clear, with no visible weather conditions affecting the scene. The overall view is from an objective perspective, providing a comprehensive look at the racetrack and the ongoing race.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
