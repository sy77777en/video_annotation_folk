    "pre_caption": "From a high-angle perspective, the scene is captured in a static full shot. Two humanoid figures are positioned in the middle ground; one is seated on the left, and the other is in the center-right, both at a long desk that extends horizontally across the frame. In the background, a large bank of monitors is arranged behind the desk, filling the upper portion of the frame. On the desk in the middle ground, two keyboards are visible, one in front of the right figure and another further left, with a mug situated between them. A text overlay is fixed in the bottom left corner, and a second text element appears in the lower-left quadrant of the foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dimly lit room, two humanoid figures rendered in a white, low-polygon, geometric style are seated at a long desk. The figure on the left, wearing a matching white hat, sits in a blue office chair, leaning back with its arms crossed. The second figure sits to the right, also in a blue office chair, with its back to the viewer, facing a bank of multiple television screens. Each screen displays distinct images of two white men. One man, appearing more frequently, has short light-brown hair and is wearing a light-colored collared shirt, suggesting he is a contestant on a game show. The other man, who seems slightly older and is dressed in a brown suit, resembles a game show host. Each screen shows a single-person shot.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high-angle perspective, the scene is set in a dark, indoor room dominated by a long wooden desk and a large bank of CRT monitors. Two low-polygon, white, geometric figures occupy blue office chairs at the desk, which holds two beige keyboards and a white mug. Each screen displays a close-up of one of two white men. The first man, who appears more frequently, has short light brown hair and is wearing a light-colored collared shirt. The second man, who seems slightly older, is dressed in a brown suit and resembles a host. The multiple screens are all tuned to the game show \"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?\", displaying various multiple-choice questions. The primary light source is the glow from these monitors, which illuminates the figures and the desk. An overlay in the bottom left corner reads \"ITV - Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? (2001)\", and another text overlay appears in the lower-left quadrant stating \"192 coughs\".**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: Two 3D models of humans are sitting in front of a board with multiple screens displaying different men. The 3D models are likely framed as full shots.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
