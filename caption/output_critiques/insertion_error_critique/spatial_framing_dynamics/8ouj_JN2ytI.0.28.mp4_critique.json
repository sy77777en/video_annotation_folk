    "pre_caption": "This wide shot, filmed at the subject's level, initially positions the main football player in the yellow jersey in the right-middle ground, running towards the camera. A large brown dust cloud erupts from the field across the middle ground, originating behind this player and expanding laterally. To the right and slightly behind the main player, another player in a blue uniform is in the middle ground, initially kneeling. Additional players in blue are seen in the left foreground and across the middle ground, while stadium stands populated with spectators occupy the background on both the left and right sides. As the main player advances, he moves towards the center foreground, while the dust cloud continues to grow and spread across the middle ground behind him.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main focus is a football player with dark skin, wearing a black helmet adorned with a light yellowish-white logo, a yellow jersey with black accents and a number, black pants, and white shoes. This player is running forward, carrying a deep red football. Directly behind him, a large, dense cloud of brown dust and debris erupts upwards from the green football field. Another football player, distinguished by a blue and white helmet and uniform, is kneeling on the grass behind the main player, having fallen down but now getting up to follow him forward. Additional football players are present on the field: some, also in blue and white uniforms, are running in the foreground and midground, while several players in both blue and white, as well as yellow and black uniforms, appear very small in the distant background.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene unfolds outdoors in a large American football stadium during the daytime, under a bright, overcast sky. The lower stands are densely packed with spectators, while the upper deck reveals the yellow seating structure due to fewer occupants. Although the crowd's density makes it challenging to discern the color of their clothing, many spectators are holding yellow signs or banners, complementing the yellow facade of the upper deck on one side of the structure. The playing surface is a green grass field, marked with white lines characteristic of American football, and yellow goalposts are visible at one end. A football game is in progress, with players in athletic uniforms on the field. A prominent visual element is a large, turbulent cloud of brown dirt or dust that erupts from the field and moves across it, seemingly in conjunction with the players' movements.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
