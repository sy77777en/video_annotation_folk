    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide, high-angle scenery shot of a town street at night, focusing on the environment rather than specific subjects. In the foreground, a large, vertical pink neon sign is positioned on the left side of the frame. The middle ground is occupied by the main street and its buildings, which are adorned with numerous neon signs, including a red arrow sign in the center-left and a green \"EAT\" sign in the center-right. A red fire truck is initially centered in the middle ground, driving away from the camera. A small car enters from the right and moves toward the camera on the left side of the road, while two classic cars enter from the bottom right and proceed to follow the fire truck down the street. In the background, the dark silhouette of hills is visible.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a vibrant cityscape scenery shot of a small town's main street at night, bathed in the glow of numerous colorful neon signs. The focus is on establishing the lively, retro atmosphere of the environment rather than highlighting a specific subject. The street is lined with low-rise buildings adorned with signs like a large vertical pink \"MRS MUFFLE\" sign, a yellow arrow for \"MUDDY'S MUDFLAPS,\" and a green arrow pointing down that reads \"EAT.\" A red fire truck drives down the center of the road, while a small, light-colored car travels in the opposite direction on the other side of the street. Two classic cars, one red and one teal, are moving forward behind the fire truck, all contributing to the bustling yet nostalgic ambiance of the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor view captures a town street at night, brightly lit by numerous colorful neon signs. Low-rise buildings line the dark asphalt road, with the dark silhouette of hills visible in the background. The scene is dominated by glowing advertisements, including a tall, vertical pink sign for \"Mrs. MUFFLE,\" although the last character(s) are not very clear, a red arrow-shaped sign with yellow bulbs for \"MUDDY'S MUDFLAPS,\" a green vertical sign that reads \"EAT,\" and a blue sign for \"WIMPY'S.\" A red fire truck drives down the street, while other cars, including two classic-style vehicles, move along the road.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
