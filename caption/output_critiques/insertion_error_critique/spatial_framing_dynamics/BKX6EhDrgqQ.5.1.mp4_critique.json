    "pre_caption": "The video maintains a full shot of a self-service kiosk, which is consistently positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. Initially, the camera is positioned above the kiosk, capturing an angled view of its right side and a portion of its front screen. The camera then smoothly arcs in a clockwise direction around the kiosk while simultaneously lowering its height. This movement transitions the view, first revealing more of the front screen displaying a menu from a front-left perspective, and then settling on a direct frontal view of the screen which shows an \"order & pay here\" message. By the end of the movement, the camera is at the kiosk's level. The tiled floor is visible in the bottom foreground and middle ground, with a blurred, light background occupying the top and rear of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with an angled, elevated view of a white, rectangular self-service kiosk mounted on a black cylindrical pole with a black rectangular base. The kiosk features a large vertical touchscreen. The camera moves in a clockwise arc around the kiosk, initially capturing the side of the screen displaying the text \"FAST & EASY order & pay here\" in blue and white, accompanied by a yellow McDonald's \"M\" logo and the text \"Touch to Order\" below it. As the camera continues to move, it reveals the menu side of the screen, showcasing images of food items, descriptions, and prices. The camera then returns to the \"FAST & EASY order & pay here\" side, where it finally stops. A card reader slot is visible beneath the screen, and the side of the white kiosk unit has several small, dark rectangular and circular ports or slots. Two small, thin antennae protrude from the top of the unit.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video features a white, rectangular McDonald's self-order kiosk mounted on a black pole with a rectangular base, set in a studio-like environment with a blue-grey tiled floor and a blurred, light grey-blue background with soft, out-of-focus light spots. Initially, the camera is positioned at an angle above the kiosk, focusing on the side displaying \"FAST & EASY order & pay here\" in blue and white, along with the McDonald's logo, a graphic of a payment terminal, and text indicating \"Touch to Order.\" The camera then arcs clockwise around the kiosk, revealing another side with a menu of food items and prices, before returning to the original \"FAST & EASY order & pay here\" view, which remains unchanged. Below the screen, a physical payment terminal slot and a receipt printer slot are visible, and two small, thin antennae protrude from the top of the kiosk.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",
