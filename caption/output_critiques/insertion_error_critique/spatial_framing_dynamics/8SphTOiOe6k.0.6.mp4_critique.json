    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide, eye-level scenery shot of a Japanese town street. Initially, the frame captures a view down the road, with pedestrians in the middle ground on the right and a mountain in the background. A traditional building sits on the corner in the middle ground on the left. The camera then executes a slow pan from right to left. This movement shifts the compositional focus, bringing a two-story building with a red awning to dominate the left and center of the frame. A smaller, single-story structure attached to it occupies the foreground on the left. By the end of the pan, the street and the pedestrians are positioned on the right side of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a streetscape scenery shot of a quiet Japanese town on a bright, sunny day. There is no single main subject, as the camera's slow pan is designed to capture the overall atmosphere and environment of the location rather than focusing on a particular person or object. The scene is characterized by traditional Japanese architecture, with buildings featuring dark tiled roofs and wooden facades, one of which has a prominent red awning on its upper floor. A few pedestrians stroll along the sidewalk, and a white van is parked near a small outdoor seating area. In the background, green mountains rise against a brilliant blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds, enhancing the tranquil and picturesque quality of the townscape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, pans slowly from right to left across a street in a Japanese town on a sunny day. The sky is blue with scattered white clouds, and a green, tree-covered mountain is visible in the distance. The scene is illuminated by late afternoon light, casting long shadows on the asphalt road. On the left, a two-story building with a tan facade, a red awning, and a dark tiled roof sits on a corner. In front of it is a smaller, single-story structure with a brown wooden exterior. A few pedestrians are seen walking on the sidewalk on the right side of the street. A white van is parked further down on the left, near a building with a white paper lantern hanging outside.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
