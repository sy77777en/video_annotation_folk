    "pre_caption": "The video features a medium shot of a person riding a motorcycle, with the camera positioned at the subject's level. The rider is centrally framed, with the motorcycle's handlebars visible in the foreground. Initially, the setting includes a busy street with parked cars and buildings in the background. As the scene progresses, the environment transitions to a tree-lined road, indicating movement through different urban areas. The rider remains in the center throughout, maintaining a consistent position relative to the camera. The background shifts from modern architecture to bare trees, suggesting a change in scenery while the camera remains locked on the rider, capturing the dynamic ride.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a person riding a motorcycle. The rider is wearing a black helmet with a reflective visor, obscuring their face. They are dressed in a black leather jacket with gray accents and black gloves. The motorcycle is dark-colored, and the rider is positioned upright, holding the handlebars. The setting changes from a more open area with other vehicles visible to a tree-lined street, indicating movement through different environments.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a locked-on POV shot from a camera mounted on a motorcycle, capturing a dynamic ride through an urban environment. The setting is outdoors, transitioning from a busy street with parked cars and buildings to a tree-lined road. The time of day is daytime, with clear skies and scattered clouds. The rider, wearing a black helmet and leather jacket, is central to the scene, with the handlebars and part of the motorcycle visible. The surroundings include a mix of modern and older architecture, with bare trees indicating a colder season. The movement includes some noticeable bumps as the motorcycle navigates through traffic and along the road.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
