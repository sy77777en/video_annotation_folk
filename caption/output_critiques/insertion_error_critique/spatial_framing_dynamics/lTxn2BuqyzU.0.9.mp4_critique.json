    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of a young boy positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, seated at a light brown wooden desk. A small, dark green pencil rests on the left side of his desk, also in the middle ground. Partially visible desks flank him on the left and right sides, in the middle ground. In the background, a light-colored wall displays several blank white papers, and a light blue and green globe on a stand is visible on the right side. Sunlight illuminates the scene, primarily from the left. Towards the end of the shot, a blurry, dark gray silhouette of a woman holding a book moves from the right to the left in the foreground, briefly obstructing the view of the boy. The camera remains at the boy's level throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a young boy with pale skin and black hair styled in a bowl cut, sitting at a desk while wearing a white shirt and a green knitted vest. Two classmates are partially visible beside him. Notably, a green vine with leaves is depicted growing out of the boy's nose. Toward the end of the video, a woman holding a book walks across the screen from right to left in front of him.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a classroom, with a light brown wooden desk positioned in the middle ground, flanked by two additional desks on either side of the screen. A small, dark green pencil rests on the central desk. In the background, a light-colored wall features several blank white papers and a light blue and green globe on a stand, located on the right side of the screen. Sunlight streams in from an unseen window, illuminating the scene. A blurry, dark gray silhouette of a woman briefly obstructs the view.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
