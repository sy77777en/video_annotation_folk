    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a full shot of a manhole cover positioned in the center foreground of the frame. The surrounding street surface occupies the lower foreground and middle ground, with building corners visible in the background at the top of the frame. The camera is initially positioned above the manhole cover, looking down. The perspective then transitions, shifting to view the scene from below the manhole cover. This reveals the second subject, a bomb, also framed in a full shot in the center foreground, attached to the underside of the manhole cover which is now above it. The dark space below the cover forms the background. The camera is positioned below this second subject, looking up.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a close-up of a round, textured metal manhole cover on a paved surface, featuring a grid pattern and several bolt holes. As the scene transitions, the focus shifts to the underside of the manhole cover, revealing a device attached to it. This device consists of several red cylindrical objects resembling dynamite sticks, connected by colorful wires to a digital timer displaying numbers. The transition highlights the concealed nature of the device beneath the manhole cover.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video opens with a ground-level view of a circular, rusted metal manhole cover set into the asphalt surface of a city street intersection during the daytime. The cover features a textured grid pattern and several small holes. White crosswalk lines are visible on the street, and multi-story buildings with large windows form the background corner. The perspective then shifts to an overhead view looking down from inside the manhole shaft, revealing a bomb attached to the underside of the cover. The device consists of multiple red dynamite sticks held by metal bands, connected by red, blue, and green wires to a central timer unit with a green digital display showing numbers.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a full shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned above the subject when the first subject is in focus, and below the subject when the second subject is in focus.",
