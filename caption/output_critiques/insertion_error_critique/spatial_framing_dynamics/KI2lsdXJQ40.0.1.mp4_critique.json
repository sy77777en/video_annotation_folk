    "pre_caption": "The video uses a medium shot, showing the stylized male figure from the chest up, centrally positioned in the frame and occupying the middle ground. His head and upper torso are visible, with his face and upper body aligned with the vertical center of the image. The camera is at the same height as the subject’s head, providing a straight-on view. In the background, a blurred wall and a dark blue vertical surface are visible, both positioned toward the right side and extending into the background. A simple chair with horizontal slats appears on the left side of the frame, also in the background. The spatial arrangement remains static throughout the shot, with no notable movement or change in the positions of the subject or background elements.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a stylized male figure with a pale, elongated face and prominent ears, characterized by short, dark brown hair parted to the side, round eyeglasses, and faint stubble on his chin and upper lip. He has a slightly open mouth and visible blush on his cheeks, giving his face a flushed appearance. The man is dressed in a light gray collared shirt with a small pocket on his left chest, and his expression appears neutral. The figure’s features and attire are rendered in a sculpted, handcrafted style, suggesting he is a puppet or stop-motion character rather than a real person.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place indoors in a softly lit room with muted blue and gray tones. The background features a blurred wall and a dark blue vertical surface, possibly a door or partition, along with a simple chair with horizontal slats. The environment is uncluttered, with smooth surfaces and minimal decoration. A stylized figure with a pale, matte-textured face, round glasses, and short brown hair stands centrally, facing forward. The figure’s shirt is light-colored with a small pocket and subtle button details. The lighting is even, with no strong shadows, and the overall atmosphere is calm and quiet. No overlays, text, or additional visual elements are present.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
