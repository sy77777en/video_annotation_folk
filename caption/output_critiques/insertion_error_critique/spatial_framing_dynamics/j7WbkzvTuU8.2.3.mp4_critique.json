    "pre_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide, high-angle shot of a vast, dark cityscape. Initially, a large, robed statue stands in the center middle ground, surrounded by ornate buildings. A circular plaza filled with small figures and explosions occupies the foreground, while towering, futuristic skyscrapers are visible in the background. A fast-moving object flies from the top of the frame and strikes the central statue, causing it to topple forward. The statue falls from its position in the middle ground and crashes into the foreground plaza, creating a large cloud of dust and debris that rises from the bottom center of the frame. The camera remains in a static, high-angle position throughout the event, observing the destruction from above.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a dystopian cityscape scenery shot, focusing on the grand scale of destruction and the oppressive atmosphere rather than a single character or object. The absence of a main subject allows the viewer to take in the full scope of the chaotic event unfolding. The scene is set in a vast, monochromatic city defined by a mix of ornate, classical architecture and towering, futuristic skyscrapers in the background, all shrouded in a dark, overcast sky. A massive, robed statue is violently toppled from its pedestal, crashing into a large circular plaza filled with swarming, indistinct dark figures and punctuated by small explosions. The air is thick with smoke and debris, conveying a powerful sense of a city under a massive assault.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone pans over a vast, dark cityscape under a heavily overcast sky. The scene, rendered in a monochromatic palette of grays and blacks, features ornate, classical-style stone buildings arranged around a large, circular plaza, with taller, futuristic towers rising in the background. Smoke and fog drift through the streets, where numerous small figures are gathered. A massive stone statue of a robed figure, which initially stands in the center of the plaza, is struck and topples sideways and backward, crashing into the ground and sending up a large cloud of dust and debris as small explosions flash below.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
