    "pre_caption": "The shot opens with the right side of the frame entirely blacked out by a foreground obstruction, showing only a sliver of a room on the far left. The camera then pans from left to right, gradually revealing a young girl in a full shot, sitting on the floor in the middle ground. In the final framing, she is positioned in the center-left of the visible space. To her left, a large stuffed lion rests on the floor in the middle ground, with other plush toys surrounding her. A dark piece of furniture sits in the background behind her. The foreground obstruction continues to cover the right portion of the frame, and the camera is positioned at the girl's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **As an obstruction moves from right to left, the video gradually reveals a young girl with light skin and blonde hair styled in two pigtails. She is sitting on a carpeted floor in a dimly lit room, wearing a pink short-sleeved shirt under blue denim overalls and purple shoes. The girl holds a grey, round stuffed toy in her lap and is surrounded by other plush toys, including a large stuffed lion to her right backward and a yellow dog-like toy to her left. She looks up and toward the right with a neutral, watchful expression.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a dimly lit child's bedroom, viewed from a partially obscured vantage point that blacks out both the right and left sides of the frame. A young girl sits on the carpeted floor, surrounded by several large stuffed animals, including a prominent lion. In the background, a dark piece of furniture holds a picture frame and other small items. The low-key lighting casts deep shadows throughout the room, creating a quiet and somber atmosphere.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a full shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
