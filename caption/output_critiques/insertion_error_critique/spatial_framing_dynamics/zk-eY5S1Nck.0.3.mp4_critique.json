    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot of a young girl positioned in the center foreground, with a white railing to her left in the foreground and a wall of pictures in the right background. The camera, initially at the girl's eye level, pulls back and tilts down, transitioning into a wide shot. In this final framing, the girl is repositioned to the top left of the frame, while a blue balloon is revealed in the center-right background at the bottom of the stairs. The camera is now positioned above the scene, looking down toward the balloon.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young, light-skinned girl with brown hair styled in two high pigtails stands at what appears to be the top of a staircase. She is wearing a pink, short-sleeved shirt under blue denim overalls. The girl looks down, focused on a white string she is holding in her hand. The scene then reveals a blue balloon floating a short distance away from her near the bottom of the stairs.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors at the top of a dimly lit staircase. To the left, a white railing with vertical slats lines the edge of the landing. At the bottom of the stairs, a wall is decorated with a gallery-style arrangement of various-sized family photos in white frames. A single blue balloon floats in the corner at the base of the stairs, near the decorated wall.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a wide shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and above the subject when the second subject is in focus.",
