    "pre_caption": "This is a static medium shot of an animated dog positioned in the center-left of the frame and in the middle ground. The dog is inside the cockpit of a vehicle, the light grey-blue body of which occupies the foreground from the bottom left, while its purple-framed canopy extends across the middle of the frame. In the background, a red structure is visible on the right, with a blue sky seen in the top center. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An animated, light-brown, fluffy dog with large brown eyes and a small black nose is shown from the chest up. The dog is wearing a bright purple helmet with a silver, shield-shaped emblem on the front and cutouts for its ears. It is seated inside the cockpit of a futuristic vehicle, which has a light grey-blue body with a hexagonal texture and a vibrant purple and pink frame around a transparent purple canopy.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **During the daytime, a sleek, light blue-grey aircraft with vibrant purple and magenta accents is positioned partially inside a large, red structure. The vehicle's body features a hexagonal texture, and its cockpit is enclosed by a purple-tinted canopy. Through the structure's opening, a bright blue sky with soft white clouds is visible. A small, light-brown dog wearing a purple helmet sits in the pilot's seat, looking out from the cockpit.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
