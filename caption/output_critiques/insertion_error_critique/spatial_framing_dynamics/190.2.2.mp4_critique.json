    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a full shot of the gray sedan, capturing the entire vehicle from a side angle. The car is positioned in the foreground, occupying the central part of the frame, while the urban street and buildings form the background. The person inside the car is visible through the rear window, situated towards the right side of the frame. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to a medium shot, focusing more closely on the car's rear section. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective. In the medium shot, the car still dominates the frame, with the person in the back seat now more prominent, their arm resting on the window frame. The background elements, such as the buildings and sidewalk, remain visible but are less detailed due to the closer framing. The camera's position does not change significantly, keeping the car and its occupant as the primary focus.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a gray sedan with a sleek, angular design, characterized by its reflective surface and distinctive rear window shape. The car is parked on a street, and its rear license plate is visible. The vehicle's windows are slightly tinted, and the roof has a sunroof feature. Inside the car, an individual wearing a light-colored hat and jacket is seated in the back seat, facing forward. In the front right seat, a person wearing a dark beanie is turning their head towards the back. The setting suggests an urban environment with buildings and a sidewalk visible nearby.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an urban street scene during the day, featuring a quiet, tree-lined residential area. The setting includes brick buildings with roadside landscaping shrubs and a sidewalk. A notable visual element is a gray car with a sleek, angular design, parked on the street. The car's metallic surface reflects the surroundings, adding a dynamic texture to the scene. The street is calm, with minimal traffic, and the lighting suggests a clear day, casting soft shadows on the pavement. The environment conveys a sense of tranquility and order, with neatly maintained surroundings and a peaceful atmosphere.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
