    "pre_caption": "This is a static wide shot of scenery with no main subject. The scene is framed by out-of-focus green foliage in the foreground, occupying the left and right sides of the frame. In the middle ground, a dark, rocky creek flows from the top center towards the bottom center. The creek is situated between steep, shaded banks covered in moss and vegetation. The camera is positioned at a high angle, looking down into the ravine.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a nature scenery shot capturing a view of a shallow, rocky creek flowing through a lush, green forest. The perspective is from above, looking down into a shaded ravine, with out-of-focus foliage in the foreground creating a natural frame around the dark, rippling water. There is no main subject in this video; the focus is instead on the tranquil and secluded atmosphere of the forest environment. The composition emphasizes the feeling of peeking into a hidden, natural space rather than highlighting a specific object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A view from a dense, wooded area looks down into a shallow, narrow creek. The scene is framed by out-of-focus green leaves in the foreground on both the left and right. The creek, filled with dark water, flows gently over a bed of dark, rounded rocks. The steep, earthy banks are covered in moss and other dark green vegetation under the shade of the forest canopy.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
