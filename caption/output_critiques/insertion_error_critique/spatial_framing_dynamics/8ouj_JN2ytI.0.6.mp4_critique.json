    "pre_caption": "In a medium close-up shot filmed at the subjects' level, a line of football players and a coach are positioned in the foreground. Initially, a player in a number 7 jersey is on the far left, a coach is left of center, and a player in a number 91 jersey is in the center of the frame. A large crowd of spectators fills the background. The camera slowly pans to the right, causing the player with number 7 to move out of the frame on the left. Consequently, the coach shifts to the far left, the player with number 91 moves to the left of center, and another player wearing number 99 becomes fully visible, occupying the right side of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A group of men from a football team stand in a staggered formation. A white man with short dark hair, a light goatee, and black eye paint under his eyes wears a yellow, black, and grey jersey with \"GOTHAM\" and the number \"91\" printed in black on the front, and he has his right hand over his heart. To the left of him, a man with a light brown skin tone and a bald head stands wearing a black jacket over a yellow shirt with a \"GOTHAM\" team logo on the chest; he also holds his hand over his heart. To the right of the first player is another white man with a full brown beard, short brown hair, and black eye paint, wearing a matching \"GOTHAM\" jersey with the number \"99\". To the far left, another white player with short, light brown hair and eye paint is partially visible, wearing a jersey with the number \"7\". All the men have serious expressions.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a large, outdoor football stadium during the day, a line of football players and a coach stand with one hand over their hearts. The players wear bright yellow jerseys with black and grey accents, featuring the word \"GOTHAM\" and large black numbers, including \"91\" and \"99\". Some players have black paint under their eyes. The coach is dressed in a black jacket with a team logo. In the background, the stadium's concrete stands are packed with a dense crowd of spectators, predominantly dressed in the team's yellow and black colors. The camera moves slowly from left to right along the line of individuals, with the player wearing number 7 gradually moving out of the frame, while the player wearing number 99 gradually comes into view.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
