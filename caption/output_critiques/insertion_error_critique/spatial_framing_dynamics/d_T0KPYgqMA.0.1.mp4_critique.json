    "pre_caption": "This medium shot, filmed at the subjects' level, frames a courtroom scene with a distinct layering of elements. In the foreground, the out-of-focus shoulder and arm of a person occupy the left and bottom of the frame. The main subject, a standing female barrister, is positioned in the center-right of the middle ground. In front of her, also in the middle ground, a seated male barrister is seen from behind in the center of the frame. The background is filled with observers seated on benches across the upper portion of the shot, with a uniformed officer standing at the top left.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a fair-skinned woman dressed as a barrister, standing in a wood-paneled courtroom. She wears a traditional white, curly wig, a black gown over a white collared shirt with barrister's bands, and appears to be speaking. She leans forward slightly, with her right hand resting on the wooden rail in front of her, and turns her body to the left, facing the camera. Seated before her, with his back partially to the viewer, is a man also dressed as a barrister in a wig and gown. In the background, a diverse group of men and women are seated in tiered benches, observing the scene. To the left in the background, a man with short dark hair stands wearing a dark uniform. The entire scene is framed by the out-of-focus shoulder and arm of a person in the immediate foreground.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a traditional courtroom, characterized by dark, wood-paneled walls and matching wooden furniture. In the background, several people are seated on benches in a gallery, observed by a uniformed officer standing against the back wall. Natural light filters into the room through a window covered with white horizontal blinds. In the middle ground, two barristers in black robes and traditional white wigs are positioned at their bench; one is standing while the other remains seated. In the foreground, the arm of a person is visible.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
