    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, a man on a skateboard enters from the left middle ground. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, pans right, keeping the man centered as he moves across the frame. He approaches a picnic table located in the center middle ground. Upon reaching it, he dismounts, and his skateboard rolls into the bottom left foreground before stopping. The man remains in the center of the frame as he vaults over the picnic table, landing behind it in the middle ground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with short, dark hair is shown in a black-and-white video. He wears a white short-sleeved t-shirt, dark trousers, and dark sneakers with a white stripe. The man is skateboarding and, upon approaching a picnic table, he dismounts his board, places his hands on the tabletop, and then prepares to land steadily after jumping over it. His skateboard continues to roll forward on its own after he gets off.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a paved outdoor area, presented in black and white. A tall chain-link fence lines the background, behind which stands a set of metal monkey bars and other playground structures. The asphalt ground is furnished with several simple wooden picnic tables and benches. A few sparse trees are visible around the perimeter of the space, which is also bordered by plain, boxy buildings. The camera pans smoothly, following movement across the open area.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
