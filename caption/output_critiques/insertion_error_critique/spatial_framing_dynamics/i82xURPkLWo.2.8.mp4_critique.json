    "pre_caption": "In a static extreme wide shot, a man is positioned in the middle ground, walking from the right side of the frame to the left along a boardwalk that extends horizontally across the scene. The foreground and middle ground are dominated by a vast marsh, with a line of trees visible in the background on the far left. The sky fills the top half of the frame. Text reading \"Buttermilk Sound, GA\" is superimposed in the bottom right corner. The camera is positioned above the man.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned man with a bald head or very short blond hair and a muscular build is shown walking from right to left across a long concrete and steel boardwalk. He is wearing a dark reddish tank top and dark pants. The text \"Buttermilk Sound, GA\" is displayed in white at the bottom right of the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a vast coastal marshland at either sunrise or sunset, under a sky filled with scattered clouds tinged with warm orange and yellow hues. An overlay in the lower right identifies the location as \"Buttermilk Sound, GA.\" The expansive, flat landscape is covered in brown and tan marsh grasses, interspersed with channels of calm water. A long, straight boardwalk, constructed from metal and concrete with light-colored railings and a dark walking surface on pilings, extends across the marsh. A person is walking from right to left along this boardwalk. In the distance, a line of trees is visible on the left horizon.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
