    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot of people stretching, with the camera positioned at their level. In the foreground, a man with pink hair occupies the center-right of the frame, while the person he is holding hands with is in the center-left. In the background, another pair of people performs the same stretch to the left. As the subjects alternate leaning forward, the shot transitions into a medium close-up, tightening the frame on the person in the white tank top on the left as they bend forward.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with light skin and short, bright pink hair is sitting on the ground, leaning forward in a stretch. He wears a light blue short-sleeved t-shirt and white sneakers. He is holding hands with a person in front of him who has light skin and is wearing a light-colored sleeveless tank top. This person is also sitting on the ground and leaning forward, alternating with the individual with pink hair. In the midground, beside these two, there is another group of people with light skin, short dark hair, and light-colored tank tops, also performing the same seated forward bend stretch. All the individuals are arranged in a line, participating in a group stretching exercise.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an outdoor urban setting with a concrete surface, a group of people in athletic wear are seated on the ground. They are performing an alternating stretching exercise, leaning forward from a seated position and holding hands with partners. The scene has a desaturated color palette, with the exception of one individual's bright pink hair. A concrete wall is visible in the background.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
