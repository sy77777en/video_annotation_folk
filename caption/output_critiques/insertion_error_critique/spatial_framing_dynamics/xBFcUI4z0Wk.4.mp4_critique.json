    "pre_caption": "From a high-angle full shot, a damaged race car is stationary in the center of the frame, positioned diagonally with its front end on a grass infield in the middle ground to the right and its rear end on a paved surface in the middle ground to the left. A chain-link fence occupies the bottom left foreground. A white pickup truck enters the frame from the top left and moves down and to the right, coming to a stop in the top left of the frame, behind the stationary race car.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a damaged race car, stopped at an angle with its front end on a grassy area and its rear on a paved surface. The car is a white and black Ford stock car with a large red number \"98\" on its side and roof. The front half of the vehicle is white, while the rear half is black. A blue oval \"Ford\" logo is visible on the crumpled hood and the rear quarter panel, which also features \"Ford Performance\" text. The front of the car is heavily damaged, with the hood bent upwards, and a small amount of smoke or steam rises from the front. A secondary subject, a white Ford pickup truck with \"BUILT FORD TOUGH\" on the front, is positioned on the paved surface behind the race car.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high-angle perspective, a damaged race car is stopped on a green grass infield adjacent to a paved racetrack. The car, featuring a white and black design with the number 98 in red and \"Ford\" logos, has a crumpled front end from which a wisp of smoke rises. The gray asphalt of the track is marked with a solid yellow line, and a chain-link fence is located at the bottom left corner of the frame. A white pickup truck enters the frame from the top left and comes to a stop near the rear of the stationary race car.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
