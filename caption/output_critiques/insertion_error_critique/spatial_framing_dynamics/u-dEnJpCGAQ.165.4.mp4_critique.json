    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot captured at the subjects' level, a large elephant is initially positioned in the center of the frame, walking from right to left across the middle ground of a savanna. A second, larger elephant and a small baby elephant enter from the left side of the frame, also in the middle ground, and walk in front of the first elephant, continuing the leftward movement as a group. The scene is composed of tall, golden grass in the foreground and middle ground. Scattered low green bushes and dark mounds are visible in the middle ground, some behind the elephants. In the background, a line of hazy blue-grey hills stretches across the horizon beneath a pale sky.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a group of dark grey African elephants traversing a savanna landscape characterized by tall, dry, yellow-brown grass. An adult elephant, viewed from its left side, walks across the scene from right to left; it has visible tusks. A significantly smaller, dark grey baby elephant walks in front of this adult. Another adult elephant, also dark grey and similar in size to the first, walks in front of the baby, maintaining the same direction and profile view. Meanwhile, one elephant remains stationary as the three elephants move from right to left.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Elephants, appearing as dark grey forms, traverse a wide expanse of tall, golden-yellow dry grass in an outdoor savanna landscape. Scattered low green bushes and small, dark, rounded mounds are visible across the plain. In the distance, hazy blue-grey hills meet a pale, hazy sky, bathed in soft, diffuse light.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
