    "pre_caption": "This video is an extreme wide scenery shot of a vast arctic landscape at night. The frame is horizontally divided, with a snow-covered landscape occupying the bottom half and the night sky filling the top. A snowy road extends from the bottom center foreground into the middle ground, where a few small, illuminated buildings are situated. To the right, a treeline rests on the horizon in the middle ground, while a partial dome structure is visible in the middle ground on the far left. The aurora borealis dominates the top and center of the frame in the background, its brilliant green lights swirling and pulsing dynamically across the sky. The camera remains static at a low height, angled upwards to emphasize the scale of the aurora.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a breathtaking landscape scenery shot of a polar or subarctic region at night. The focus is not on a single subject but rather on the overwhelming scale and atmosphere of the environment, emphasizing the grandeur of the natural world. A vast, snow-covered terrain, glowing with an ethereal green hue, stretches towards a distant treeline under a dark, star-studded sky. Dominating the entire scene is a spectacular and dynamic display of the aurora borealis, with brilliant green lights swirling, waving, and pulsing across the heavens. A snowy road is prominently visible, extending from the foreground to the mid-ground, where a few small, illuminated buildings are clearly discernible, all dwarfed by the immense natural spectacle above.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **At night, a vast, swirling aurora borealis dominates the sky with brilliant green light. The dynamic, curtain-like display of light moves across the dark, star-filled sky above a wide, snow-covered landscape. The ground, blanketed in thick white snow, is illuminated by the green glow from above. A snowy path leads from the foreground toward a few small, lit buildings in the distance. A line of dark coniferous trees stands on the horizon to the right, and a small, dome-like structure is partially visible behind a snowbank to the left.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
