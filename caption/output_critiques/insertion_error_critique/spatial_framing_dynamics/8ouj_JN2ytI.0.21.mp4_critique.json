    "pre_caption": "This wide shot captures a football game. In the foreground, a player in a yellow jersey with the number \"14\" is positioned slightly right of center, facing away from the viewer. To his left and in the middle ground, another player in a similar uniform runs towards the left side of the frame. Further to the right in the middle ground, two additional players in yellow and black uniforms are visible. A referee in a black and white striped shirt stands in the middle ground, slightly left of center, facing towards the right. A tall, yellow goalpost is prominent on the left side of the frame, extending from the middle ground upwards. The green football field, marked with white lines, occupies the lower portion of the frame, stretching from the foreground to the background. The stadium stands, filled with a large crowd predominantly in yellow, occupy the background across the upper portion of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **On a green football field marked with white lines, four football players are visible. A player in the mid-ground, wearing a yellow jersey with the black number \"14\" on the back, black pants, and white shoes, stands facing away from the viewer. To his left and further back, another player in a similar yellow jersey and black pants runs towards the left side of the field, where a yellow goalpost stands. Two additional players in yellow and black uniforms are positioned further to the right. A man, serving as a referee, dressed in a black and white striped shirt, black pants, and a black cap, stands in the mid-ground, facing right. Behind them, the stadium stands are filled with a large crowd of spectators, predominantly dressed in yellow.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a football game in progress from an objective viewpoint during an overcast day, looking down the length of a green artificial turf field marked with white yard lines. A tall, yellow, U-shaped goalpost stands prominently on the left side of the field. The stadium stands are packed with a large crowd, predominantly dressed in yellow, creating a dense sea of color. The stadium structure itself is made of grey concrete and metal. Several players in yellow and black uniforms are on the field, along with a referee in a black and white striped shirt.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
