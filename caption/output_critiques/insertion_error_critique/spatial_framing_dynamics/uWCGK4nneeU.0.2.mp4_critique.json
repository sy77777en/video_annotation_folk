    "pre_caption": "In a static full shot, a large, derelict ship is positioned centrally in the middle ground, its massive hull extending across the width of the frame. A smaller, broken section of the ship rests on top of the main wreckage, slightly to the right of the center. In the foreground, rocky formations and sand are visible at the bottom left and bottom right corners. The background is composed of distant mountains that stretch across the horizon, situated below the clear sky at the top of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A massive, derelict ship rests in a vast expanse of brownish-white sand. The ship's long, metallic hull is broken and partially submerged in a dune. Its exterior is a mix of rusted, reddish-brown plating and weathered grey sections, marked with faded white diagonal stripes. A smaller, more distinct structure, possibly the bridge, is perched at a severe angle atop the larger hull section. The entire vessel shows signs of significant damage, with twisted metal and debris scattered around its base.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed from a ground-level perspective captures a vast desert landscape characterized by brownish-white sand dunes and distant, pale mountains. Partially buried in the sand lies the massive, derelict hull of a ship, its rusted red-brown and grey metal contrasting with horizontal white stripes. The vessel is broken, with a smaller superstructure resting askew atop the main wreckage. The scene is set under a clear, pale blue sky during the day, with no noticeable shadows from the shipwreck on the sand.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
