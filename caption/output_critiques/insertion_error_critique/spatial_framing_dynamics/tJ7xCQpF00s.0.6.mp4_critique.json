    "pre_caption": "This is a static, wide scenery shot from an eye-level perspective, looking down a narrow urban alley that occupies the center of the frame. The alley extends from the foreground to a brightly lit opening in the background. The scene is framed by tall building walls on the left and right. A line of dumpsters is positioned along the left side, starting in the foreground with a container that has an orange lid and extending into the middle ground with a prominent blue dumpster. The wet pavement in the foreground and middle ground has several puddles. A yellow curb runs along the base of the wall in the bottom right of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a cityscape scenery shot depicting a dark, narrow, and wet urban alleyway. The scene is framed by the towering, shadowy walls of adjacent buildings, creating a strong sense of confinement that leads the eye toward a brightly lit opening in the far distance. The ground is slick with rainwater, forming puddles that reflect the dim, cool-toned light, while numerous large dumpsters and trash bins line the path, adding to the gritty, neglected atmosphere. There is no main subject, as the focus is entirely on the environment itself, emphasizing the moody, cinematic quality and the stark contrast between the dark foreground and the distant light.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A view from an eye-level perspective looks down a narrow, dark urban alley flanked by the tall, dark walls of adjacent buildings. The pavement is wet and uneven, with puddles reflecting the bright light coming from the sky at the far end of the passage. Large trash dumpsters, including a prominent blue one and another with an orange lid, are lined up along the left side. The scene is characterized by a cool, desaturated, teal-toned color palette, creating a contrast between the shadowy foreground and the brightly lit exit of the alley. A yellow-painted curb runs along the base of the wall on the right.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
