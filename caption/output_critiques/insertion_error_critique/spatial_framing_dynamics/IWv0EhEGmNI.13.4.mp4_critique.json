    "pre_caption": "The scene opens from a high-angle perspective, looking down at a burning decorative piece in the middle ground on the right and a red-carpeted staircase occupying the center. The camera then pans left while tilting up and rolling slightly counter-clockwise, transitioning to a level angle. This movement reveals two figures in the center middle ground walking away down a burning corridor. As the camera pans, a text overlay reading \"Captain Price\" appears in the center-right of the frame. Flames are scattered throughout the scene in the foreground and middle ground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The scene opens with a hollow decorative piece on the steps engulfed in flames. The steps are covered with a red carpet featuring dark, intricate patterns. Bright orange flames illuminate the surrounding ruins. As the camera pans left, it reveals two individuals ahead, both dressed in camouflage uniforms.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video begins with an unsteady, first-person perspective at eye level, initially capturing a high-angle view of a section of stairs. The camera then pans left, tilting upward and rolling slightly counterclockwise, transitioning to a level angle. This movement reveals a dilapidated indoor corridor where two individuals in camouflage uniforms are walking ahead. On the left side of the frame, part of another room is visible. Small flames are scattered across the floor, walls, and some furniture in both the corridor and the adjacent room. A white text overlay in the center-right of the scene reads \"Captain Price\" as the camera is panning left.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
