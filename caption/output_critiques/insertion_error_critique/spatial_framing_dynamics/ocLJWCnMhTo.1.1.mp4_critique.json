    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a full, overhead shot, positioning the camera directly above a man lying on a table in the center of the frame. The black and white checkered floor occupies the background, while meandering, glowing orange lines are superimposed in the foreground. The camera then executes a shaky upward crane in an arc, causing the entire scene to rotate and become upside down. During this transition, a second, shirtless man is revealed at the bottom of the frame, standing on the floor which is now positioned at the top of the screen. The final composition is an inverted, low-angle shot. The first man on the table is at the top of the frame, while the second man is in the lower portion. The checkered floor is in the background at the top of the frame, with light-colored walls and framed pictures visible in the middle ground. The glowing orange lines remain as a stationary effect in the foreground throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with an overhead, bird’s-eye view of a man wearing a white, short-sleeved turtleneck shirt and black pants, lying on his back on a table with his head on a chair, set against a checkered floor. The camera then performs a shaky upward crane in an arc, transitioning to an upside-down, low-angle shot from hip level. As the camera moves, a second man, shirtless with dark skin, is revealed and remains visible throughout the video.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video begins with an overhead, bird’s-eye view of a person lying with their back on a table and their head on a chair against a black and white checkered floor. The camera then performs a shaky upward crane in an arc, transitioning to an upside-down, low-angle shot from hip level. The floor is covered in a black and white checkerboard pattern, and light-colored, textured walls are adorned with several framed pictures. A person stands nearby, making a total of two people in the scene. Meandering, glowing orange lines appear as a stationary effect, swirling around the figures and the room.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The shot begins with a full shot of a person lying down. The camera then cranes upward, revealing another person standing. By the end, the standing figure disappears from view, leaving only a medium shot of the one lying down.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject and then changes to at the subject's level.",
