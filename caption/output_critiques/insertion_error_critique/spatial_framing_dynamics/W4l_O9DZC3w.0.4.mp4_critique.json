    "pre_caption": "This static shot is composed using a tiny planet perspective, which distorts the scene into a spherical mass of interwoven twigs and grass that occupies the center of the frame as the primary foreground element. At the very top of this sphere, positioned slightly to the right of center, a couple is seen in a wide shot. The light blue sky acts as the background, completely enveloping the central sphere and filling the surrounding space to the edges of the frame. Thin, dry branches from the nest structure radiate outward from the central mass, extending toward the bottom and right of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Atop a large, spherical nest composed of interwoven dry brown twigs and grass, a man and a woman are kissing. The woman, on the left, has long, reddish-brown hair and a fair complexion. She is wearing a reddish-brown top with green accents and red fishnet stockings. The man, to her right, has dark, curly hair, a darker complexion, and is dressed in a white tank top and blue jeans. They are both perched on the nest, leaning toward the right in an embrace.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A large, spherical nest constructed from dry, brown twigs and grass is prominently featured in the center of the frame, with some branches extending toward the lower left edges of the image. Above the intricately woven structure, a light blue sky with wispy white clouds is visible. A man and a woman are situated atop the nest, engaged in a kiss.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The composition uses a tiny planet perspective, curving the ground into a spherical mass of dried grass and branches at the frame’s center. At the very peak of the sphere, slightly to the right, a couple is shown in a wide shot, locked in a kiss. The sky envelops the sphere, filling the rest of the frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera uses a tiny planet perspective, making it difficult to determine its actual height.",
