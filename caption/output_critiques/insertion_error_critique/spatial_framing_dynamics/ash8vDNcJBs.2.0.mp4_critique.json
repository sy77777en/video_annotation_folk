    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a soldier positioned in the center-right foreground, with other soldiers to his left and behind him in the middle ground. As the group runs from right to left across the frame, the camera follows their movement, transitioning into a medium full shot that reveals more of their bodies. During this action, a large explosion occurs in a ruined building located in the middle ground on the left side of the frame. Throughout the shot, distant mountains are visible in the background, and the camera remains at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a soldier in the foreground, running while wearing full tactical gear. He has on a black helmet and a full-face gas mask with a visible corrugated hose connected to the side. He is dressed in a tan tactical vest over a dark long-sleeved shirt, with a blue band on his left bicep, and tan pants. He carries a black rifle. Following him and running alongside are several other soldiers, who constitute the secondary subjects. They are all similarly attired in helmets, gas masks, and military uniforms, and are also carrying rifles, moving together as a unit.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene unfolds in a sunlit, arid desert landscape characterized by dusty, brown terrain and distant rocky mountains under a clear sky. The area is scattered with the rubble and ruins of multi-story concrete buildings. A group of soldiers in full tactical gear, including helmets and gas masks, run through this environment as a large, fiery explosion erupts from one of the dilapidated structures in the background.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
