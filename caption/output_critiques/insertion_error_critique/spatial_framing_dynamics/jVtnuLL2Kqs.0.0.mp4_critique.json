    "pre_caption": "This scenery shot opens with an extreme wide shot from a low angle across the River Thames. The water fills the foreground in the bottom half of the frame. In the middle ground, a section of the London Eye is on the left, while the expansive facade of County Hall stretches across the center and right. A tour boat is positioned in the middle ground, to the right of the center, in front of the building. The camera then executes a slow zoom, transitioning the view into a wide shot that reframes to focus on the central portion of County Hall. This movement pushes the London Eye further to the left edge and partially crops the tour boat at the bottom, bringing the repeating pattern of the building's windows to the center of the composition. A logo is overlaid in the bottom right corner throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a cityscape scenery shot capturing a view of London from the River Thames during what appears to be dawn or dusk. The scene is dominated by the grand, classical-style facade of County Hall on the riverbank, with a portion of the London Eye visible to the left. A white tour boat is moored near the bank as the water gently shimmers with reflected light, all cast in a warm, desaturated, sepia-toned palette. There is no single main subject; instead, the focus is on establishing the grand scale of the architecture and the tranquil, atmospheric mood of the city environment. The camera's slow zoom onto the building's repeating windows emphasizes the vastness of the structure rather than any specific detail.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in London during sunset, viewed from across the River Thames. At the beginning of the video, the water in the foreground beautifully reflects the warm, dim light. On the left, a portion of the white structure of the London Eye, with its spherical passenger pods, is visible. Across the river stands the long, stone facade of County Hall, a multi-story building with numerous windows, some of which are illuminated. A white tour boat is on the river near the bank in front of the building. The camera slowly zooms in on the architectural details of County Hall. An overlay consisting of a stylized logo is visible in the bottom right corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with an extreme wide shot of the scenery. It then changes to a wide shot.",
