    "pre_caption": "A medium shot, filmed from the passenger's side at the driver's level, frames a man in the right half of the screen. He is seated in the driver's seat, with his hands on the steering wheel in the bottom right foreground. To the left, the car's side mirror occupies the bottom left foreground, while a portion of the red car's body is visible in the middle ground. A street at night can be seen in the background through the windshield. Throughout the shot, the framing remains static, but water droplets begin to appear on the windshield, slightly obscuring the view of the man.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned man with dark brown, short hair and a short, well-groomed beard sits in the driver's seat of a car at night. He wears a dark t-shirt under a rust-colored jacket. With one hand gripping the black steering wheel, which has a red stripe at the top, he looks forward with a focused expression. The interior of his car is dark, and a portion of a red car is visible just outside his window.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot, mounted inside a vehicle, captures a nighttime drive along an urban street. The road is flanked by light-colored buildings and illuminated by streetlights in the distance. The primary focus is on a man driving, his hands on a black steering wheel with a red marking. The car's dark interior is visible, with the driver's side mirror on the left. Outside the window, a portion of the red car body, part of the vehicle he is driving, is visible. Water droplets are present on the windshield throughout the video, becoming more noticeable as the car moves forward and light reflects off the glass.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
