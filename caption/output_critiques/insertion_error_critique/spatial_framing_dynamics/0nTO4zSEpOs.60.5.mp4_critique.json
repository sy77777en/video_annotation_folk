    "pre_caption": "This wide shot initially frames a nighttime urban scene from an elevated pedestrian walkway. In the foreground and middle ground, the walkway stretches across the frame, populated by pedestrians. A man in a suit walks towards the camera near the center foreground before moving towards the right. Another man walks away from the camera in the left middle ground, while a woman walks towards the camera in the right middle ground. Illuminated buildings, including ones marked \"GMO\" and \"Tokyu Plaza,\" occupy the left and center middle ground and background. Below the walkway, visible in the center and right middle ground and background, is a busy street with buses, cars, and more pedestrians. Elevated train tracks are visible in the background. The camera, positioned at roughly eye level with the pedestrians on the walkway, slowly pans to the right. As it pans, the buildings on the left shift towards the left edge of the frame, revealing more of the street-level activity, including a bus terminal area and buildings on the right background. The text \"VIRTUAL JAPAN.TV\" remains fixed in the bottom left foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures a bustling urban scene at night, featuring a modern cityscape with illuminated skyscrapers and digital billboards. In the foreground, pedestrians are visible on a walkway. The background showcases a busy street with several buses and cars, highlighting the vibrant city life. The overall atmosphere is lively, with the bright lights of the buildings contrasting against the night sky.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a bustling urban environment at night, set in a vibrant cityscape with towering buildings adorned with bright advertisements and digital billboards. The setting is outdoors, featuring a modern pedestrian walkway elevated above a busy street filled with traffic, including buses and cars. The scene is illuminated by artificial lights from the surrounding skyscrapers, creating a lively atmosphere. Notable architectural features include a mix of contemporary high-rises and commercial structures, with a prominent building labeled \"Tokyo Plaza.\" The pedestrian walkway features white light tubes on the railings, illuminating the ground. It is paved with light-colored tiles and has railings made of metal and glass. Pedestrians, some wearing coats, walk along the walkway, adding a sense of motion and activity. Overlay elements include text at the bottom left corner, reading \"Virtual Japan,\" which is not part of the scene itself.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
