    "pre_caption": "In an extreme close-up shot, a pair of hands occupies the center foreground, holding a broken white cable. The left hand is positioned on the left side of the frame, while the right hand is on the right. The fingers of both hands manipulate the two frayed ends of the cable at the very center of the frame, twisting them slightly to reveal the internal components against a blurred white background. The camera is positioned at the same height as the hands.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A pair of neutral-skinned hands pinches one end of a white, braided cable with the index finger and thumb. The outer fabric sheath is frayed and pulled back from the break, revealing the inner white plastic insulation, which is also torn. The fingers manipulate the broken end, showing the internal copper wires at the core of the cable. The hands are positioned to display the damage up close.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a close-up view, a pair of hands holds a broken white cable against a plain white background. The cable features a braided, textured sheathing that is frayed and torn at the break. The fingers manipulate the two separated ends, revealing the white fibers of the outer layer and the small inner wires.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme close-up shot of the subjects.",
