    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a large aircraft inside a hangar, capturing most of its body and surroundings. The aircraft, positioned centrally in the frame, occupies the middle ground, with its side facing the viewer. The text \"NORSK FREIGHT\" is visible on its side. Surrounding the aircraft, a cloud of smoke or mist fills the air, primarily in the foreground and middle ground. Several white cargo containers with red and black markings are situated in the bottom left corner of the frame, in the foreground. Overhead industrial lights illuminate the scene from above, casting a warm glow throughout. Metal beams and structural elements of the hangar form the background. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to a medium shot, focusing more closely on the aircraft's nose and front section. The camera remains at the subject's level, maintaining a consistent perspective. The smoke continues to billow, partially obscuring the aircraft's details. The cargo containers remain in the same position relative to the aircraft, though they appear smaller due to the change in shot size. The overall spatial dynamics emphasize the interaction between the aircraft, the smoke, and the surrounding industrial elements.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases a large cargo plane prominently positioned within an indoor setting. The aircraft is primarily white with small visible windows and metallic sections featuring rivets and a distinct nose. It bears the text \"NORSK FREIGHT\" on its side, indicating its purpose. The plane is surrounded by a cloud of smoke or mist, suggesting activity or a process occurring around it. In the foreground, there are several white cargo containers with red and black markings, labeled with \"N\" symbols, indicating their contents or handling instructions. The scene is illuminated by overhead industrial lights, casting a warm glow over the entire area. The setting appears to be a hangar or a similar facility, emphasizing the industrial and logistical nature of the subjects.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting within a large hangar-like structure at night, featuring a massive aircraft crashing into the hangar, causing it to collapse.. The environment is industrial, with metal beams and bright overhead lights illuminating the scene. The aircraft, with its metallic surface, dominates the space, while smoke or mist envelops parts of it, creating a dynamic atmosphere. Two unidentified labeled objects are prominently visible in the midground, adding to the industrial feel. The scene is characterized by a warm color palette, with the lighting casting a yellowish hue over the area. **\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
