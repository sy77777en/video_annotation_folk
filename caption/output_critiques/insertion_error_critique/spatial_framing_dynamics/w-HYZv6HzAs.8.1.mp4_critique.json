    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a man positioned in the center foreground. In the background, a large screen displays a city skyline silhouette along the bottom, with text visible in the bottom left and bottom right corners. The man moves slightly to the right as the shot transitions into a medium close-up, which reframes him on the left side of the screen. He then turns his head to the left, looking toward the edge of the frame. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A middle-aged Black man with a bald head, short dark hair on the sides, and a dark mustache is shown speaking. He is wearing a light pink, long-sleeved, button-up shirt. A small microphone is positioned to his left of his mouth, and he wears a ring on his left hand. Throughout the video, he stands, pacing to his right and then turning to his left, continuously gesturing with his left hand while maintaining an expressive facial expression.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A man stands on a well-lit stage with a large presentation screen positioned behind him. The screen features a bright blue background with a black silhouette of a city skyline along the bottom edge, including a tall tower on the far right. The text \"TEDxRyersonU\" is located in the bottom left corner of the screen, while \"THINK FORWARD 2011\" is displayed in the bottom right corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
