    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot, positioning a man in an Army uniform in the right middle ground. In the left foreground, a group of military personnel gathers around a brightly lit table. The background is populated by other individuals in both military and civilian attire. The camera then slowly pushes in on the main subject as he turns to look directly forward, transitioning the shot into a medium close-up. In this final framing, the man is centered, while the surrounding people are pushed toward the edges of the frame and remain in the background. Throughout the shot, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a middle-aged Black man in a US Army camouflage uniform, who stands in a command center and looks directly forward with a serious expression. He has short black hair, and his uniform features a \"U.S. ARMY\" tape, a name tape that appears to read \"BLAKE,\" a Ranger tab, and a star-in-a-circle patch on his left shoulder. He is surrounded by other military personnel and a few civilians. In the foreground and to his left, several men in various military uniforms, including a Black man with glasses and a white man with short hair, are gathered around a large, brightly lit table, looking down at what appears to be a map or plan. In the background, other men in suits and military uniforms, along with a woman in uniform on the right, are also visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a dimly lit, modern command center. In the center of the room, a group of military personnel in various camouflage uniforms and a few civilians in dark suits are gathered around a large, brightly illuminated map table. The room's primary light source comes from long, white fluorescent strips on the dark ceiling. The background is filled with other people and indistinct computer consoles, creating a sense of a busy, operational environment. The overall color palette is muted, consisting of dark tones, grays, and the greens and browns of the uniforms, with the white table serving as the main visual anchor.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
