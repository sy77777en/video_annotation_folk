    "pre_caption": "The scene is captured in a wide shot from a high-angle, aerial perspective, looking down on the action. Initially, a small, dark-cloaked figure is positioned in the foreground at the bottom center of a large, illuminated area. In the middle ground, a goat-like creature stands to the left of the center. In the background, two more goat-like creatures are visible at the top-left and top-center, alongside a floating blue creature at the top-center. A blue projectile travels from the bottom right towards the center-left. As the sequence progresses, the cloaked figure moves upward toward the top of the frame. The goat-like creatures also move within the light; one in the middle ground is defeated and vanishes, while another moves from the top-left toward the center. The floating blue creature disappears from the top-center. A second projectile is fired from the right side, and the cloaked figure generates a large, glowing red crescent shape in the top-center of the frame. A game HUD remains fixed in the top-left corner throughout. The camera's position remains static.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dimly lit, high-angle view, several stylized humanoid figures are depicted on a dark blue surface littered with red rocks. The most prominent figures are brown, goat-like creatures clad in tan attire, distinguished by large, white, crescent-shaped horns or headpieces. Among them is a small, dark figure in a dark cloak holding a glowing red sword. Initially, a floating, blue, triangle creature holding a stick is visible, but it disappears shortly thereafter. The scene features two bright blue, glowing projectiles leaving a white smoke trail, likely created by another dark figure hidden on the right side. White, air-like fragments are scattered around the weapons of the prominent figures. Large, glowing red crescent shapes materialize when the small dark figure with the glowing red sword attacks.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person 3D gaming video with a high-angle, aerial perspective shows the environment in a three-quarters perspective. The scene takes place in a dark, cavernous setting with a flat, dark blue floor, illuminated by a large, irregularly shaped spotlight. The ground within the light is scattered with red rocks. Throughout the sequence, stylized characters move and fight, generating visual effects like a glowing red crescent shape, a blue projectile with a white smoke trail, and white, spiky impact flashes. A green glowing object provides additional light from the upper portion of the illuminated area. An overlay in the top-left corner displays a heads-up display (HUD) featuring a green health bar, four white diamond-shaped icons, and four icons to the left of them.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
