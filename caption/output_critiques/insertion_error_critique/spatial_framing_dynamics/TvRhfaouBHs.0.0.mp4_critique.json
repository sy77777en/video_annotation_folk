    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a full shot showing the cartoon boy seated at his desk, positioned centrally in the frame and occupying the middle ground. His entire upper body, head, and desk are visible, with his head and hands resting on the desk surface. To the left, the partial figure of another boy is visible at the edge of the frame, also in the middle ground, with only his torso and arm shown. The window is on the left side of the frame in the background, allowing sunlight to enter, while the chalkboard is in the background on the right. A stack of books is placed at the bottom left in the foreground, and the desk with a piece of paper is in the center foreground. The camera is at the same height as the seated boy, providing a straight-on view. The shot then transitions to a medium shot, cropping closer to the main boy so that only his head, shoulders, arms, and the upper part of the desk are visible, with the boy remaining centered in the frame and the camera still at his eye level. The partial figure of the other boy and some background elements become less visible or move out of frame as the shot tightens.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A cartoon boy with an atypically large and stylized hairstyle sits at a desk. His brown hair is sculpted into several large, rounded, cloud-like sections that form a voluminous bouffant. He has a light skin tone, large blue eyes with heavy eyelids, and eyebrows that are angled upwards toward the center. His mouth is slightly open and downturned. The boy is dressed in a white collared shirt and a green sweater vest. He rests his cheek on one hand while holding a yellow pencil in the other, looking down at a piece of paper on his desk. To the left, part of the side of another cartoon boy is visible; this boy is wearing the same white shirt and green sweater vest as the boy in the middle.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place inside a classroom during the daytime, with sunlight streaming through a window on the left, casting natural light onto the scene. The classroom features blue walls, a large green chalkboard, and a wooden desk with a smooth surface and rounded edges. Stacks of books with colorful covers and visible spines are arranged on a nearby table, and a single piece of paper is on the wooden desk in front of the boy. The window reveals a glimpse of green foliage outside, indicating a clear day. The overall environment is tidy and organized, with simple furnishings and a calm atmosphere. No overlays such as text, icons, or watermarks are present in the video.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
