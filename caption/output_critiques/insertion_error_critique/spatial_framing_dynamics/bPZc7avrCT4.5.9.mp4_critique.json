    "pre_caption": "In this full shot, a green water balloon rests in the center of the frame on a tree stump located in the foreground. The background contains a pile of logs on the left and green foliage, all of which are out of focus. A blue towel enters the frame from the right and moves toward the center, striking the balloon. The balloon bursts in slow motion, with water exploding outwards from the center across the frame. The green balloon fragments are pushed toward the left and bottom, while the blue towel remains on the right side, partially obscured by the water spray. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A vibrant green, translucent water balloon with a glossy surface rests on the flat top of a light-brown tree stump. The balloon is oblong, and its tied-off opening is visible at the bottom. A bright blue, terry cloth towel enters from the right and strikes the balloon, causing it to burst. The impact results in a dramatic, slow-motion explosion of water, which sprays outwards in a wide, misty cloud. Fragments of the green balloon and a piece of the blue towel are visible within the splashing water as it erupts.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a sunlit outdoor setting, a single green water balloon rests on the flat top of a wooden tree stump. The background, which is out of focus, features green foliage and a pile of cut logs. A blue, textured object enters from the right and strikes the balloon, causing it to rupture in slow motion. Water erupts from the point of impact in a wide spray of droplets as the green rubber of the balloon tears apart.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
