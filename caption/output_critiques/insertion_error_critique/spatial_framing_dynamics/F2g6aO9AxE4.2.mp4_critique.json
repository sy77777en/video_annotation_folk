    "pre_caption": "This video starts with a full shot of a Komodo dragon in the center-left of the frame, located in the middle ground. To its right, a large cardboard box stands in the middle ground, with a background of a rocky wall and green plants. The dragon walks from the center towards the left, and the camera pans to follow its movement. As the camera tracks the subject, the framing transitions to a medium shot, focusing on the dragon's upper body. The dragon continues its path across the frame from right to left, eventually moving partially out of the left side of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A large Komodo dragon with brownish-gray, beaded skin and a powerful, muscular body walks across the scene. It has a long, thick tail, sturdy legs with dark, clawed feet, and an elongated head. The lizard initially approaches a large, brown, rectangular cardboard box standing upright, flicking its long, forked tongue out to investigate it before continuing on its path.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within an indoor enclosure designed to replicate a natural habitat, where a Komodo dragon is present. The floor is covered with a layer of brown wood chips, scattered with dry twigs and a few green leaves. In the background, a grey, rocky wall stands behind green, leafy plants and bare branches. As the Komodo dragon moves and the camera follows its motion, a large, brown cardboard box gradually shifts to the left side of the screen.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
