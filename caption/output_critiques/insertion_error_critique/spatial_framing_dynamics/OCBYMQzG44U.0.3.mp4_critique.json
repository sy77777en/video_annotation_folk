    "pre_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot. A prominent red waterslide is positioned on the left side of the frame, curving downwards from the upper left towards the lower center, situated in the middle ground. Partially obscured behind it, a green waterslide is also on the left, in the middle ground. The pool water occupies the lower-middle area of the frame, also in the middle ground. A metal railing extends diagonally from the bottom left foreground towards the center-right middle ground. A light-colored, grid-patterned platform is in the bottom right foreground. White tiled walls form the background, particularly visible in the upper half of the frame. In the top right background, another metal railing encloses an area near a simple doorway. The camera is positioned above, looking down into the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases a 3D game environment from a first-person perspective, featuring an indoor recreational scene with a pool area and large, brightly colored waterslides. A prominent red waterslide curves downwards towards a pool of water, with a metal railing situated in the middle ground. Behind it, a green waterslide is also visible. The surrounding area includes white tiled walls and a tiled platform or walkway with a grid pattern. The focus is on the overall environment and the interplay of these elements, highlighting the atmosphere and design of the space.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, looks down into an indoor pool area within a 3D game. The scene is relatively dimly lit, revealing white tiled walls, with some sections featuring a reflective, textured tile pattern. Dominating the left side are large, smooth, tubular waterslides; a prominent red one curves downwards towards the dark blue or teal water of the pool, with a portion of a green slide visible behind it. A metal railing runs along the edge of a platform in the middle ground, which has a light-colored, grid-patterned surface. Another metal railing encloses a section of the pool area in the background, near a simple doorway.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
