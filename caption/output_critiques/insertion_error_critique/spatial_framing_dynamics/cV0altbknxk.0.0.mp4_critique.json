    "pre_caption": "A close-up, level-angle shot frames the draped fabric of a light-colored garment. The off-white material, arranged in soft folds, extends from the foreground to the background, filling the entire frame. A large, black button is positioned in the bottom left foreground. Another button is located in the middle ground, just right of the center, while a third is situated further back and to the right. A fourth button is partially visible in the top right background, and a fifth is partially seen at the far left edge. The shot remains static throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A close-up view reveals a light beige trench coat made of a twill fabric with a distinct diagonal weave. The garment is draped in soft folds, and several large, round, black buttons are sewn onto its surface. Each button has four holes in the center arranged in a cross shape and features text engraved around its rim.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A close-up, low-angle shot captures the draped fabric of a light-colored garment in an indoor setting with a plain, light gray background. The off-white material, featuring a fine twill weave, is arranged in soft folds and undulations. Scattered across the fabric are several large, circular black buttons, each with four-hole stitching in a cross pattern. The scene is evenly lit with soft, diffused light, which creates gentle shadows within the creases of the garment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
