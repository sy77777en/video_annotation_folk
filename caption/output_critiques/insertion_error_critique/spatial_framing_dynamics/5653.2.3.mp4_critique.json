    "pre_caption": "The video features a medium close-up shot of a Black woman positioned centrally within the frame. Her head is tilted to her right, and her eyes are closed, suggesting a moment of calm. The camera is at her eye level, capturing her from the shoulders up. The subject is in the foreground, with a dark, indistinct background that emphasizes her presence. The lighting softly highlights her facial features, creating a contrast with the dimly lit environment. There are no significant changes in shot size or position throughout the scene, maintaining focus on her serene expression and the subtle details of her appearance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A Black woman with brown skin is shown in a close-up. She has dark, shoulder-length wavy hair and is wearing a black strapless top. A small gold hoop earring is visible in her left ear. Her makeup includes dark eyeliner and glossy lipstick. Her eyes are closed, her head is tilted to her right, and a streak of moisture is visible on her right cheek.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors with a dimly lit environment, creating a subdued and intimate atmosphere. The background is dark, providing a stark contrast to the subject, who is positioned centrally. The subject has a relaxed posture, with eyes closed, suggesting a moment of calm or introspection. The lighting softly highlights the subject's features, emphasizing the smooth texture of the skin and the subtle sheen on the lips. The overall color palette is warm and muted, with the subject's attire blending seamlessly into the low-light setting. The focus remains on the subject, with no other visible elements or distractions in the environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
