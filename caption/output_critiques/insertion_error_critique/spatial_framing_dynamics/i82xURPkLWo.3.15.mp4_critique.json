    "pre_caption": "The video features a medium shot of two men seated in a rustic room. The older man, positioned on the left side of the frame in the foreground, sits on a brown leather couch, while the other man, seen from behind in the center-right foreground, occupies a black chair. Both are situated at eye level with the camera. The room's large windows dominate the background, offering a view of an expansive landscape with a tree directly outside. Various objects, including a lamp, books, and potted plants, are scattered throughout the middle ground, primarily on the left and right sides of the frame. The camera remains static, capturing the subjects and the room's elements consistently without any changes in shot size or position. The camera height is at the subjects' level, maintaining a direct perspective on their interaction.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two men seated in a rustic room with large windows. The man on the left is older, with a bald head and wearing a light blue shirt. He is sitting on a brown leather couch, facing forward with his head slightly turned to the right to engage in conversation. The second man, seen from behind, has short hair and is wearing a dark brown shirt. He is seated in a black chair, facing forward with his head slightly turned to the left to look at the older man. The room contains various objects, including a lamp, books, and potted plants, and offers a view of a vast, open landscape with a tree positioned right outside the window. The setting suggests a casual, conversational atmosphere.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a third-person over-the-shoulder POV shot showing a character’s upper body in a rustic indoor setting. The room features large windows that offer a view of a vast, open landscape with golden fields stretching to the horizon under a clear sky, suggesting daytime. The interior includes worn wooden walls and a mix of vintage and eclectic furniture, such as leather chairs and a wooden desk. Potted plants and a standing lamp add to the cozy atmosphere. The scene captures a blend of natural and man-made elements, with the expansive outdoor view contrasting the intimate, lived-in feel of the room.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
