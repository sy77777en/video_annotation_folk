    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a wide shot, looking down from a high angle. A white spiral staircase occupies the center and left middle ground, descending towards a pool of light green water that fills the lower middle ground and background. A metal railing is in the immediate foreground at the bottom of the frame, with another railing following the staircase. White columns with dark green bases are positioned in the background around the pool, and a small, blurred yellow object is visible in the water at the bottom center middle ground. The camera then pans left and tilts upward, shifting to a wide shot of an interior space. In this new view, a white tiled floor extends from the bottom foreground to the middle ground, while white tiled walls are in the upper middle ground and background. A dark grey textured band runs horizontally across these walls in the middle ground, and several tall, narrow, rounded windows emitting bright light are situated on the right background wall.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents an interior architectural scenery shot, characterized by its clean, minimalist, and somewhat surreal aesthetic. It depicts a white, tiled environment, initially showing a spiral staircase with a metal railing descending into a pool of light green water, surrounded by white columns with dark green bases. A blurred yellow rubber duck toy is located in the pool at the bottom of the frame. As the camera pans left and tilts upward, the scene transitions to another area with white tiled floors and walls, the latter featuring a band of dark grey textured material and several tall, narrow, rounded windows emitting bright light. There is no main subject because the focus is on the overall architectural design, the sterile yet intriguing atmosphere, and the interplay of light and shadow within these spaces, rather than on any particular entity or object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an indoor, tiled environment. Initially, the view is from above a white spiral staircase with a metal railing, which descends around a large central pillar into light teal water where a small orange object, possibly a rubber duck, floats. White cylindrical pillars with dark green bases line the perimeter. The camera is positioned next to the railing on the second floor, looking down. It then pans left and tilts upward to reveal the scene on the second floor after ascending the staircase, primarily showcasing the white tiled floor, walls, and the glowing elements on the walls, which could be either light fixtures or windows. The wall appears curved due to barrel distortion, not its actual shape. The small orange object is later seen on the tiled floor of this room.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
