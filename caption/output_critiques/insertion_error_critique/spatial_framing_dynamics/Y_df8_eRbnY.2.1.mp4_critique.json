    "pre_caption": "The video uses an extreme wide shot to capture a broad riverside landscape, with the winding river occupying the left and bottom left of the frame in the foreground and middle ground, while the narrow road runs parallel to the river along the lower and middle right of the frame, also in the foreground and middle ground. Dense, leafless trees fill the right and upper portions of the frame, extending from the foreground into the background, while low hills and a clear sky are visible in the distant background at the top of the frame. A white car is visible on the road near the lower center, but it remains small and secondary within the expansive scene. The camera, positioned high above the landscape, maintains a steady, elevated perspective throughout, emphasizing the scale and spatial relationships between the river, road, forest, and distant hills without significant changes in shot size or subject position.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures a sweeping view of a winding river bordered by dense, leafless trees and a narrow road that curves alongside the water. A white car travels along the road, adding a subtle dynamic element, but it is not the primary focus. The scene extends into the distance, revealing a vast expanse of forested terrain and low hills under a clear sky, emphasizing the natural environment and the scale of the landscape. The emphasis remains on the expansive setting and tranquil atmosphere, rather than any specific object or individual.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone shows an outdoor riverside landscape during the day, with a winding road running parallel to the water’s edge. The river has a calm, reflective surface with a deep blue-green color, bordered by rocks and sparse vegetation. On one side of the road, there is a dense area of leafless trees and shrubs in muted brown and gray tones, suggesting late autumn or early winter. The terrain is mostly flat, stretching into the distance with low hills visible on the horizon under a clear, pale blue sky. There are no overlays or visible weather effects, and the scene remains steady as the drone moves smoothly above the landscape, capturing the natural features and the quiet, expansive environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
