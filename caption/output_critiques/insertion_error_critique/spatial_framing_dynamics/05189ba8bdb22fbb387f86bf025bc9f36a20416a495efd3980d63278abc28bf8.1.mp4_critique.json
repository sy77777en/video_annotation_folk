    "pre_caption": "The video presents a full shot of three brown horses with saddles on a grassy and rocky terrain. The main subject, a horse with a dark brown coat and darker mane, is positioned in the foreground, slightly to the right, with its head lowered as it grazes. The camera is at the horse's level, emphasizing its presence. In the middle ground, two other horses are visible; one is slightly to the left and the other to the right, facing different directions, which adds depth. The background features a rugged, mountainous landscape under a bright sky, providing a sense of openness and tranquility. The spatial arrangement remains consistent throughout the video, with the main horse maintaining its position and focus in the foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features three brown horses with saddles, standing on a grassy and rocky terrain. The main subject is the horse in the foreground, which is grazing with its head lowered. It has a dark brown coat and a darker brown mane, and the saddle is prominently visible. Behind it, two other horses are standing; one is slightly to the left and the other to the right. Both have similar saddles and are facing different directions, adding depth to the scene. The horses are positioned in a natural setting with a mountainous backdrop, emphasizing their presence in the landscape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an outdoor setting on a rugged, mountainous terrain with a clear view of distant, layered hills under a bright sky, suggesting daytime. The ground is a mix of dirt and patches of green grass. Several horses, equipped with saddles, are scattered across the scene, grazing peacefully. The horses are brown with dark manes, and their saddles are made of leather, adding a rustic element to the natural environment. The overall atmosphere is serene, with the vast landscape providing a sense of openness and tranquility.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
