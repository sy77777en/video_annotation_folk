    "pre_caption": "The scene begins with an overhead medium shot, showing the backs of three figures in the foreground, positioned at the bottom left, bottom right, and bottom center of the frame. They face a large control console that occupies the middle ground. A large screen is centered on the console, initially displaying a map. The camera then executes a slow zoom-in, focusing on the central screen. As the view tightens, white circular lines sweep across the screen from the left. The zoom continues, transitioning into a close-up that fills the frame with the screen, where a small, stationary red dot, outlined by a white ring, appears in the center.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Three low-polygon figures are seen from behind, positioned in front of a large, weathered green control console. Each figure wears a matching teal-colored hat and uniform. The console features various buttons and a large central screen that initially displays a gridded map with a silhouette of the west coast of North America. As the view zooms in on the screen, white circular lines, resembling a radar sweep, appear and move across the display. The focus tightens until a small, solid red dot, encircled by a white ring, appears in the center-left of the screen.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From an objective viewpoint, the scene is set inside a vintage-style control room, where three low-poly figures in teal uniforms and hats face a large, greenish-gray metal console. The console features various gauges, a joystick, and panels of colored buttons with labels like \"Add power\" and \"Button.\" At the center is a large, grid-lined screen initially displaying a dark silhouette of the west coast of North America. During the sequence, white, circular sonar-like sweeps expand across the screen. The view then zooms in on the screen as the sweeps fade, replaced by a small, red, circular target with a white outline appearing slightly to the left of the center.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The shot is taken from an overhead perspective, focusing on several characters and the machines with screens in front of them. It then zooms in on the red dot that appears on the screen.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
