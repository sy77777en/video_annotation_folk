    "pre_caption": "This video is an extreme wide scenery shot captured from a high-angle, elevated viewpoint looking across a vast canyon. Craggy, reddish-brown peaks occupy the foreground at the bottom of the frame, while the expansive canyon's layered formations fill the middle ground and background. The top half of the frame is dominated by a sky of dark and light clouds. Initially, a concentrated shaft of rain falls from the clouds into the center of the frame, descending into the middle ground of the canyon. As the time-lapse progresses, this curtain of rain shifts its position from the center towards the right side of the frame. In the background on the far right, a river can be seen winding through the canyon floor.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a dramatic landscape scenery shot, capturing a powerful storm moving across a vast canyon. Heavy, turbulent clouds, a mix of dark grey and bright white, dominate the sky, and a dense, localized downpour descends into the heart of the canyon, creating a semi-transparent curtain of falling water. The canyon itself is a sprawling vista of layered red and brown rock formations, with sharp, craggy peaks in the foreground and a winding river visible in the distant valley.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From an elevated viewpoint, a time-lapse captures a dramatic weather event over the Grand Canyon. The vast landscape is characterized by layered, reddish-brown rock formations that stretch into the distance. A heavy, overcast sky is filled with dark grey and white clouds, from which a concentrated shaft of rain initially falls into the center of the canyon and then shifts towards the right. In the far right, a river winds its way through the base of the canyon floor.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
