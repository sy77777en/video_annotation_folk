    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide, aerial scenery shot. The camera is positioned high above a vast, arid landscape. Initially, a dirt track is visible in the foreground at the bottom of the frame, leading towards the middle ground. In the middle ground, a facility with several white, spherical domes is situated in the center. Rolling hills form the background, with a hazy, pink sky occupying the top half of the frame. The camera glides forward and appears to gain altitude, moving over the landscape towards the distant facility. As the shot progresses, a white text overlay appears in the bottom left corner of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an aerial landscape scenery shot capturing a vast, arid expanse under a hazy, pink-hued sky. The camera glides over rolling, brownish hills and sparse vegetation, following dirt tracks that lead towards a remote facility in the distance, identified as Pine Gap. This complex is distinguished by a series of large, white, spherical domes. There is no single main subject, as the focus is placed on the immense scale and isolation of the environment, with the slow aerial movement and atmospheric lighting emphasizing the desolate and mysterious quality of the location.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone moves forward over a vast, arid landscape under a hazy, pink sky at either dawn or dusk. The terrain features dark, reddish-brown earth with sparse vegetation and low, rolling hills on the horizon. A straight dirt track leads from the foreground toward a large, fenced-in facility in the distance. This compound contains several prominent, white, spherical radomes alongside other low-profile buildings. A white text overlay appears in the lower-left corner, identifying the location as \"Pine Gap\" with its corresponding geographical coordinates.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
