    "pre_caption": "This video is a static extreme wide shot of a cityscape at night. The illuminated Eiffel Tower is positioned in the center of the frame and in the background. In the middle ground, a large, lit building is situated in the bottom center of the frame, aligned with the tower. The rest of the city, a vast field of lights, extends across the entire frame, creating depth from the foreground to the background. The scene is captured from a high-angle aerial perspective, looking down on the urban landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a sweeping aerial cityscape of Paris at night. The iconic Eiffel Tower, illuminated in a warm, golden-yellow hue, stands as the central beacon against the dark, hazy sky. Stretching out from its base is a vast expanse of the city, a glittering sea of countless lights from streets and buildings, with a large, brightly lit classical-style building positioned in the foreground. The composition emphasizes the grand scale and serene atmosphere of the nocturnal urban environment, making the entire cityscape the subject rather than focusing on a single element.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a high-angle, nighttime view of Paris. The Eiffel Tower stands prominently in the center, its iron lattice structure illuminated by golden lights against the dark, hazy sky. Below and stretching into the distance, the city is a vast expanse of glowing lights. In the foreground, a large, classically styled building is lit with purple and white lights, situated at the head of a long parkway leading to the tower. Streaks of light from traffic are visible on the roads. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays the name \"MATHIEU STANIĆ\" and the word \"CINEMATOGRAPHER\".**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
