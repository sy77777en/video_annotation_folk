    "pre_caption": "This is a static scenery shot. A large, out-of-focus tree trunk is positioned in the foreground, occupying the left side of the frame. In the middle ground, a wooden post with a rope railing is visible on the bottom right. The background features a network of elevated walkways and bridges that stretch from the center to the right side of the frame, weaving through a dense forest of tall trees. The camera is positioned at the height of the walkways, looking out from one platform.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a forest scenery shot depicting a network of wooden platforms and rope bridges suspended high among the tall, slender trunks of evergreen trees. The perspective is from one of these platforms, with a heavily blurred, textured tree trunk in the immediate foreground, creating a sense of depth and drawing the eye towards the distant structures weaving through the dense, green canopy. There is no main subject in the video, as the focus is on capturing the immersive atmosphere and impressive scale of the treetop walkway within its natural forest setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a viewpoint partially obscured by the large, out-of-focus trunk of a tree, a dense green forest is visible. In the background, a network of elevated wooden walkways and suspension bridges connects the tall, straight trunks of other trees. These structures feature rope-wrapped railings and netting. A wooden post with thick rope coiled around it stands in the mid-ground.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows unknown of the scenery.",
