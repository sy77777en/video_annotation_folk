    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot featuring a glass of light blue liquid and a white food item positioned in the bottom left foreground. In the background, a tall, golden wine cabinet stands slightly to the right of center, initially blurred. A rack focus then smoothly shifts the plane of focus from the foreground to the background. Consequently, the glass and food in the bottom left become out of focus, while the wine cabinet in the background is brought into sharp detail, revealing its structure and the bottles within. The camera remains stationary and at the level of the foreground subjects throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a close-up, focused view of a clear, stemless wine glass on the left, which is about half-full with a pale, translucent blue liquid. Beside the glass, resting on a dark, rustic plate, are two pieces of a white-grey, crumbly food item. The focus then smoothly shifts from these foreground objects to a tall, backlit wine cabinet in the background. This cabinet, constructed from a golden-colored metal, contains multiple horizontal racks holding numerous wine bottles, which come into sharp detail as the glass and food in the foreground become blurred.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor setting, a glass containing a pale blue-green liquid rests on a dark, reflective surface. Beside the glass, two white, crumbly, block-like items are placed on a dark, textured tray. The background features a tall, modern wine rack with a gold-colored metal frame, illuminated to showcase rows of horizontally stored wine bottles. The video's focus transitions from the drink in the foreground to the detailed wine rack in the background.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with half a wine glass filled with light blue wine on the left and a white-grey food item in the foreground. A rack focus shifts attention to a wine cabinet in the background, bringing it into focus.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
