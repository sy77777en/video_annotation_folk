    "pre_caption": "This wide shot, filmed at the subjects' level, initially frames a small figure on the left and a large figure on the right, both positioned in the middle ground on a plateau. A floating monolith is centered between them in the middle ground, set against a background of mountains. The scene then cuts abruptly, and while the figures maintain their respective left and right positions in the middle ground, the background becomes black and the central monolith is replaced by a tall, bright white doorway from which white lines radiate outwards.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A small, cloaked figure and a much larger, imposing figure stand side by side. The smaller figure resembles a bird, with a black and white appearance, and carries a sword that emits a bright purple glow on its back. The larger figure is enveloped in a heavy cloak composed of large, overlapping grey feathers or scales, and its head is adorned with horns or antlers. It holds a large, simple sword. A tall, dark, rectangular monolith with a rounded top is positioned in front of them, its surface covered in a network of glowing red and pink cracks resembling lightning. The monolith transitions into a brilliant white light.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene is set on a light-colored plateau against a backdrop of jagged, dark green mountains under a pale green, cloudy sky. A tall, black, rectangular monolith with a cracked texture floats in the center, with glowing pink energy coursing through its fissures. The scene then transitions abruptly, plunging the background into complete darkness. The monolith transforms into a tall, arched doorway of brilliant white light, from which white lines streak outwards. Two figures, one small and one large, stand on the plateau before this shifting structure.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
