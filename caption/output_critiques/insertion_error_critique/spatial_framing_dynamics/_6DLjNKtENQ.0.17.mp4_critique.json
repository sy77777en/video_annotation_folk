    "pre_caption": "This full, high-angle shot initially frames a small motorboat in the top left middle ground, moving across dark water. A large, churning water disturbance occupies the center and right of the frame, also in the middle ground, with a structure visible in the foreground along the bottom edge. As the video progresses, the motorboat moves towards the top right, while the large disturbance travels from the center-left towards the right, expanding across the water's surface. The camera pans slightly to the right, following the movement and keeping the disturbance as the primary focus.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a high-angle perspective, a small motorboat with a blue hull and a white cabin moves across a body of dark water, leaving a narrow wake. A significantly larger disturbance, resembling the movement of a large, spiky creature beneath the surface, creates a wide, churning mass of white, foamy water that dwarfs the wake of the smaller vessel. The water appears dark and murky, with some areas reflecting light.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high-angle perspective, a small blue and white motorboat moves across a body of dark water, leaving a trail in its wake. The main focus is a much larger, powerful disturbance in the water, a wide expanse of white, churning foam and turbulent waves. Sunlight glints off the surface of the otherwise murky water. The edges of a concrete structure are visible at the top and bottom of the view, suggesting the scene is observed from a bridge or a large vessel.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
