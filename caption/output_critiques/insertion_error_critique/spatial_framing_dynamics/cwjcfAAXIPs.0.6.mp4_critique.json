    "pre_caption": "This is a static, extreme wide shot of a city from a high-angle aerial perspective. The scene is dominated by a thick layer of fog that occupies the foreground and middle ground, covering the bottom and left portions of the frame. In the middle ground and background, clusters of buildings with red-tiled roofs emerge through the fog, positioned primarily in the top right, center-right, and top left of the frame. The camera remains stationary throughout the clip, maintaining a consistent high-angle view over the cityscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an atmospheric aerial cityscape scenery shot, capturing a sprawling, historic European-style city with tightly packed buildings, characterized by their red-tiled roofs and light-colored facades, peeking through a thick, rolling blanket of low-lying fog. The soft, warm light suggests either dawn or dusk, illuminating the architectural details that emerge from the ethereal mist. There is no single main subject, as the composition emphasizes the overall environment and mood. The high-angle perspective and the vast, fog-laden view direct the focus to the grand scale of the city and the dramatic interplay between the urban landscape and the natural elements.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides an aerial perspective over a city during the early morning. A thick blanket of white and grey fog covers much of the landscape, with the tops of buildings emerging through the clouds. The visible structures are densely packed, featuring red-tiled, sloped roofs and light-colored walls.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
