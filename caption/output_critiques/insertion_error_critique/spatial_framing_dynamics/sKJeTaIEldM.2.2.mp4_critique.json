    "pre_caption": "A man is shown in a close-up shot, positioned slightly to the right of the frame's center and occupying the foreground. He is angled toward the left of the frame, with his right hand holding a pen near his right temple on the left side of the screen. The background consists of out-of-focus vertical panels. The camera remains static and is positioned at the man's eye level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A middle-aged, light-skinned man with short, blondish, receding hair is shown in a close-up. He wears a light blue collared shirt, a dark tie with diagonal stripes, and a white vest. A silver-colored metal band is visible on his right wrist, appearing on the left side of the frame as he faces the camera. He is equipped with a communications headset worn around his collar, including an earpiece in his left ear and a microphone extending towards his mouth. Throughout the video, he holds a black pen in his right hand, bringing his right fingers up to his right ear as he listens with a focused expression.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an indoor setting with out-of-focus vertical panels in the background, a man with short, light-colored hair is shown in a close-up. He wears a light blue collared shirt, a dark tie with diagonal stripes, and a white vest. A headset is fitted over his head, with an earpiece in his left ear and a small microphone positioned near his mouth. He holds a dark pen in his right hand, which he brings up his right fingers near his right ear as he listens with a focused expression.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
