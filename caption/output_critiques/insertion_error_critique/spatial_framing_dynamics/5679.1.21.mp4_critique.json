    "pre_caption": "The video presents a full shot of two subjects: a large, fluffy dog and a person, both lying on their backs on a grassy surface. The dog occupies the left side of the frame, while the person is positioned to the right, parallel to the dog. Both are in the foreground, with no significant background elements visible. The dog lies on its back with its legs extended upwards, and the person mirrors this pose with hands behind their head. The camera is positioned directly above them, capturing the entire length of both subjects from a top-down perspective. There are no changes in shot size or spatial position throughout the video; the framing remains consistent, maintaining the parallel arrangement of the dog and person. The grassy surface, scattered with small brown leaves, forms the immediate background, extending uniformly across the frame. The camera maintains a steady overhead angle, emphasizing the subjects' positions and the harmony between them.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a large, fluffy dog with a light cream coat lying on its back on a grassy surface. Next to the dog is a person wearing a bright blue jacket, light blue pants, and a light green beanie. The person is lying on their back with hands behind their head, looking relaxed. The dog and person are positioned parallel to each other, creating a harmonious and peaceful scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, filmed by a drone, captures an outdoor setting featuring a lush green lawn scattered with small brown leaves, indicating a natural environment. The time of day is likely midday, as the lighting is bright and even. A notable visual element is a large, fluffy dog with a curly, cream-colored coat lying on its back, alongside a person in a blue outfit and hat, both positioned on the grass. The scene is static, with no visible motion or weather changes.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
