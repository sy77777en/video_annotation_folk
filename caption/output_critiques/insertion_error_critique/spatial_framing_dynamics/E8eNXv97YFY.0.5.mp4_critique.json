    "pre_caption": "This video is a low-angle scenery shot. It begins with an extreme wide shot, capturing a completed skyscraper in the center-right middle ground and another skyscraper under construction to its left. The tops of older buildings are visible across the bottom foreground, set against a cloudy sky in the background. The camera then slowly zooms in, transitioning the framing to a wide shot. This movement causes the two middle-ground skyscrapers to fill more of the frame, appearing larger and more central, while the foreground buildings at the bottom become partially cropped. The camera is positioned below the structures, looking upward throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a low-angle cityscape scenery shot, capturing a moment of urban development. The composition is dominated by two towering skyscrapers set against a partly cloudy sky. Centrally positioned in the scene is a completed, modern high-rise with a dark, reflective glass facade that rises to a cylindrical crown at its peak. To its left stands another skyscraper in the process of being built; its dark, curved structure is still an exposed frame of concrete and steel, with a prominent construction crane visible at its very top. The upward-looking perspective emphasizes the immense scale of these structures, with the tops of older, lower-rise buildings just visible in the foreground. There is no single main subject, as the focus is on the broader environment, creating an atmosphere of architectural contrast and the dynamic nature of a growing city.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor, daytime urban scene features two prominent skyscrapers against a cloudy sky. In the center, a completed, tall, rectangular tower is clad in dark, reflective glass and topped with a cylindrical structure and a spire. To its left stands a curved skyscraper under construction, characterized by its exposed concrete floors and a large construction crane extending above it. In the foreground, the upper portions of older, shorter, light-colored buildings are visible, with the top floor of one appearing green.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with an extreme wide shot of the scenery. It then changes to a wide shot.",
