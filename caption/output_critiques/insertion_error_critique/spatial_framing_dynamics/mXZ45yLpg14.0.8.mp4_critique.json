    "pre_caption": "A full shot captures three figures from behind, with the main subject in a red suit positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. This central figure is flanked by two other individuals in dark gear, located to the left and right and slightly ahead, also in the middle ground. The group walks away from the camera, moving deeper into the background of a dense, foggy forest. Large tree trunks are visible in the foreground at the left and right edges of the frame, while more trees populate the middle ground and fade into the background, creating a sense of depth. The camera remains at the subjects' level as they proceed forward.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a person seen from behind, walking away from the viewer. This individual is wearing a full-body, red protective suit, along with black gloves and black boots. Strapped to their back is a silver-colored breathing apparatus consisting of two large vertical tanks with yellow markings. Accompanying this person are two other individuals, positioned to the left and right in front of them, who are also walking away from the viewer. These two figures are dressed in dark, possibly black or dark green, tactical uniforms with helmets and are each carrying a rifle.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Three figures navigate through a dense, dark forest shrouded in thick gray fog. The environment features tall, bare tree trunks and a muddy, uneven ground scattered with fallen branches. The lighting is dim and diffuse, creating a desaturated scene dominated by shades of gray and black. Positioned in the middle ground, the central figure wears a red full-body suit with a silver dual-tank apparatus on their back, while two other figures in dark attire walk slightly ahead on either side.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
