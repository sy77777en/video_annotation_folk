    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium, slightly high-angle shot focused on a green glass champagne bottle standing upright near the center of the frame on a textured, light green blanket, placing the bottle in the middle ground and center of the image. As the bottle tips and falls forward toward the camera, it moves from an upright position in the center to a horizontal position with its neck pointing toward the bottom right, now lying across the middle ground and occupying more of the lower half of the frame. At this moment, Jerry, the cartoon mouse, enters from the top right background, leaping diagonally downward and forward into the middle ground, landing on the left side of the frame. Jerry’s body is positioned in the middle ground, left side, with his arms extended toward the bottle, while the bottle remains in the middle ground, now spanning from the center to the right. The camera remains at a slightly high angle throughout, looking down at both the bottle and Jerry, with the textured blanket filling the foreground and the out-of-focus bedding or fabric elements in the background. The spatial dynamic is defined by the bottle’s movement toward the camera and Jerry’s jump from the upper right background to the left middle ground, resulting in both subjects sharing the middle ground but occupying opposite sides of the frame by the end of the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a green glass champagne bottle with a gold and white label standing upright on a textured, light green blanket. The bottle tips over, falling towards the camera. At this moment, the cartoon character Jerry, a small brown mouse with large pink ears, a tan face and belly, and a thin tail, appears from the upper right corner. Jerry nimbly jumps under the falling bottle and lands on the left side of the frame. He opens his arms in a showmanship gesture, smiling at the bottle. As the bottle comes to rest on its side on the blanket, liquid begins to leak out.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place indoors on a textured surface made up of tightly packed, hexagonal, cushion-like shapes in muted green tones. A green-glass bottle with a gold and white label falls onto the surface, with some liquid spilling out. As the bottle falls, Jerry, an animated mouse character with brown fur, large pink ears, and a light-colored belly, appears from the upper right corner and nimbly leaps under the bottle, moving to the left side of the frame. In the background, there are soft, out-of-focus elements suggesting bedding or fabric in pale colors. The lighting is soft and even, indicating daytime or well-lit indoor conditions. The overall setting combines realistic and animated elements, with the animated character seamlessly integrated into the environment.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This shot features a medium, slightly high-angle view of a champagne bottle falling onto a textured, light green blanket. Initially, the frame contains only the bottle, but then the cartoon character Jerry, rendered in a classic style, jumps from the right to the left half of the frame, striking a playful pose with his arms out.",
