    "pre_caption": "This wide shot captures a street scene from a stationary, eye-level perspective. In the bottom right foreground, a man and a woman are seen from behind, walking away from the camera along the right side of the road. To their immediate right, a display of pink and purple umbrellas is positioned in the foreground. The street extends into the distance, flanked by traditional buildings on the left and right in the middle ground. In the background, a mountain is visible under a blue sky. Other pedestrians can be seen walking in the middle ground. As the clip plays, the couple moves slightly further into the scene, with the woman briefly turning her head towards the umbrellas.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video features several pedestrians on a street in Japan. In the foreground, a man and a woman walk together along the right side of the road. The woman has long, dark hair and is wearing a beige trench coat over a patterned dress with brown ankle boots. The man next to her has short, dark hair and is wearing a dark-colored suit jacket, dark trousers, and a black backpack; he also wears a white face mask. In the background, other pedestrians are visible walking along the street. On the right side of the frame, a display of open umbrellas, mostly in shades of pink and purple, stands against a bamboo wall.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a walk down a paved street in a Japanese town on a sunny day. The street is lined with traditional wooden buildings featuring tiled roofs, set against a backdrop of a distant, tree-covered mountain under a blue sky with white clouds. On the right side of the road, a display of colorful Japanese-style umbrellas, including purple and pink ones, is propped against a bamboo screen. A red circular \"Do Not Enter\" sign is visible on a utility pole, and a couple walks ahead on the narrow shoulder of the road, with the man wearing a dark suit jacket.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
