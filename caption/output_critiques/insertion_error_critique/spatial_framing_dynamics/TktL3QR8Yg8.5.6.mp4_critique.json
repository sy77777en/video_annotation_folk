    "pre_caption": "A close-up shot centers on a creature's face, which occupies the foreground of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, maintaining a fixed and static perspective throughout the clip. The background is dark and out of focus, isolating the centrally positioned subject.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A close-up view shows the face of a creature with dark, textured, and slightly glossy skin. The creature has small, dark, reddish eyes that look forward. Its wide mouth is partially open, baring numerous sharp, needle-like, off-white teeth. The head is broad and somewhat flattened, with what appear to be small, dark stitches or markings above its right eye.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, undefined space, a creature's face is shown in a close-up under low-key lighting that creates deep shadows. The subject has dark, charcoal-grey skin with a bumpy, leathery, and slightly slick texture. Small, metallic-looking staples are visible on its face, just above its small, dark eyes which have a reddish tint. Its wide mouth is slightly agape, revealing rows of sharp, off-white, needle-like teeth. The background is completely black and out of focus, isolating the creature.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
