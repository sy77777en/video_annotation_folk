    "pre_caption": "This is a wide, low-angle scenery shot capturing a Venetian waterfront. A wet cobblestone promenade occupies the bottom half of the frame, extending from the immediate foreground into the middle ground. To the left, a body of water stretches from the foreground into the foggy background. A row of ornate buildings lines the right side of the frame, situated in the middle and background. A prominent dark green lamppost is positioned in the left middle ground at the water's edge. While the focus is on the scenery, a few people can be seen walking away from the camera in the middle ground. The camera maintains a low height and moves steadily forward, creating a dynamic perspective of walking along the promenade.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a cityscape scenery shot depicting a wide, wet cobblestone promenade alongside a large body of water in Venice. Ornate, historic buildings with weathered facades line the right side of the walkway, while a classic, dark green lamppost with pink-tinted glass stands prominently in the middle ground. The sky is overcast, and a light fog hangs over the water in the distance, creating a moody and reflective atmosphere on the damp pavement. There is no main subject in the video, as the focus is on capturing the expansive, atmospheric environment of the Venetian waterfront rather than any specific person or object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a walk along a wide, wet promenade in Venice on an overcast day. To the left, the grey, choppy water of a canal extends into a foggy distance. To the right, a row of traditional, multi-story Venetian buildings in shades of cream and beige features arched windows and balconies, with some walls showing exposed brick. The dark, stone-paved ground is reflective and damp. A prominent, ornate, dark green lamppost with multiple pink-tinted lanterns stands near the water's edge as a few people walk along the waterfront.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
