    "pre_caption": "In a static full shot, a man is positioned in the center of the frame in the middle ground, behind a large deer that lies in the foreground, occupying the lower half of the frame from the bottom left to the center. A compound bow rests against the deer in the center of the frame. The background is composed of a line of trees and a rocky outcrop that extends across the upper portion of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level. The man briefly touches his face before looking directly at the camera.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man in camouflage clothing and a matching beanie kneels behind a large, deceased male deer. The man has a dark beard and is looking at the camera. The deer, which has brown fur, a lighter-colored snout, and a large rack of antlers, is lying on its side on the ground. A black compound bow with an attached quiver holding several arrows with white and green fletching rests against the deer's body.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a rugged, outdoor environment under a white, overcast sky. A man in camouflage kneels on the ground, which is covered in dry, brown grass and dark rocks. In front of him lies a large, deceased buck with prominent antlers. A black compound bow with arrows is propped against the animal's side. The background consists of a line of evergreen trees and a rocky outcrop. The man briefly touches his face before looking towards the camera.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
