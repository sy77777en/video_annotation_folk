    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium full shot of a boy positioned in the center-left middle ground. To his right, a large bed occupies the right middle ground, with a cushioned chair in the bottom-left foreground and curtains lining the background. The boy turns and walks away from the camera, moving from the center-left across the frame toward the right. As he moves further into the background, the shot transitions to a full shot, capturing his entire figure as he walks around the foot of the bed and into the darkness on the far-right side of the frame. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A boy with short, dark hair and light skin, wearing a white t-shirt and dark pants, is seen in a dimly lit room. He initially stands still, looking towards a bed, before turning and walking quickly around the foot of the bed into a darker area of the room.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dimly lit bedroom at night. Two lamps cast a warm glow: one near the large bed with a dark wood headboard and white, rumpled bedding, and another near a cushioned single-person sofa. Light brown, floor-to-ceiling curtains are drawn closed along the back wall. A person wearing a white t-shirt and dark pants walks from the left side of the room, past the foot of the bed, and moves toward the right side of the frame.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
