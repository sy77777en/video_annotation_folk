    "pre_caption": "This video presents a static, extreme wide shot of a cityscape from a high-angle perspective. In the foreground, a portion of an ornate building occupies the far left, while dark rooftops fill the bottom of the frame and extend into the middle ground. The background features several illuminated landmarks against a dark sky: the Eiffel Tower is positioned on the right, a large Ferris wheel is in the center-left, and a golden dome is visible further to the left. A text overlay is fixed in the bottom right corner.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a dynamic cityscape scenery shot, offering a sweeping panoramic view of Paris at night from a high vantage point. The slow zoom-out effect enhances the focus on the expansive urban environment and its nocturnal atmosphere, highlighting the scale and beauty of the city. The iconic Eiffel Tower, brilliantly illuminated in gold, dominates the right side of the frame, its powerful searchlight beam cutting through the dark, overcast sky. Further in the distance, a large Ferris wheel glows with bright white light, and the golden dome of another historic building is visible, creating a captivating tableau of famous landmarks against the night.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A nighttime view from a high vantage point overlooks the cityscape of Paris, France. In the distance on the right, the Eiffel Tower is illuminated in a golden light, with a bright searchlight beam rotating from its peak across the dark, hazy sky. To the left of the tower, a large Ferris wheel glows with white light, and further left, the golden dome of Les Invalides is also visible. The midground and foreground are filled with the dark silhouettes of Parisian rooftops, with some windows lit from within. On the far left, a portion of an ornate stone building is seen. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays the text \"MATHIEU STANIĆ\" with \"CINEMATOGRAPHER\" below it.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
