    "pre_caption": "This wide shot is framed from a static, side-on perspective. In the middle ground, two large, glowing cranes with long, curved necks occupy the lower half of the frame, with one positioned left of center and the other right of center. Above them, a small, beige character is initially located in the upper right on a platform of blue blocks that extends across the upper portion of the scene. UI elements are overlaid in the foreground at the bottom-left and bottom-right corners. As the clip progresses, the beige character moves from the upper right to the far left, jumping across gaps in the platform. It then jumps vertically up a wall of blocks toward the top-left corner of the frame. During this action, the crane on the right turns its head to face left, while the crane on the left remains stationary.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases two stylized, pixelated cranes with glowing white and blue hues, standing in shallow water within an underground or cave-like setting. Their bodies are illuminated, creating a striking contrast against the dark surroundings. The cranes are positioned side by side, with one slightly ahead of the other, both initially facing to the right. As the video progresses, the rightmost crane turns to face left. Their long necks are gracefully curved, and they stand on thin legs. A blue-grey blob with eyes appears at the top right of the screen, moving left and jumping several times to overcome obstacles. Eventually, the blob jumps to climb a wall towards a gap in the ceiling. The scene has a digital, retro aesthetic, emphasizing the vibrant colors and pixelated design of the cranes.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A side-view gaming video captures a dark, digital environment rendered in pixel art, featuring a blue-black color scheme. The scene is enhanced by a scanline effect and numerous short blue lines falling vertically, creating white dots of light upon contact with the ground, simulating rain. The upper half showcases a pathway made of glowing blue, grid-patterned blocks. Below, a damp ground is home to two large, glowing, semi-transparent cranes standing amidst pixelated plants resembling lotuses on low platforms. Four fish-shaped statues are also present in the lower half of the background. A small, round, beige character moves along the upper platform. Overlays include an icon in a box in the bottom-left corner and four pink heart shapes in the bottom-right.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
