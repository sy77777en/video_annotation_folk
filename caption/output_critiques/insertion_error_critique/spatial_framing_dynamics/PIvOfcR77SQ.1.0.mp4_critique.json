    "pre_caption": "The video opens from a low-angle perspective, looking up from the bottom left foreground at the yurt's wooden lattice ceiling in the middle and background, with a white heater positioned on the right. The camera then pans right while moving forward, transitioning to a chest-level view that sweeps across the interior. This movement reveals a kitchenette in the middle ground, which shifts from the right to the center of the frame, followed by a blue armchair and a wooden door appearing on the right side in the middle ground and background. As the camera continues its forward pan, a light-wood chest of drawers moves to the center. The camera's movement then focuses on the lattice wall in the middle ground, moving closer to a wooden key holder. A hand enters from the bottom right foreground, reaching toward the center to touch a padlock on the holder, which becomes the central focus as the camera pushes in slightly, placing the hand and lock in the foreground against the wooden wall background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video reveals the interior of a yurt through a series of camera movements, including moving forward, pedestaling up, and panning right, as it follows a person toward the house. The structure has a distinctive wooden lattice wall and a conical roof with radiating wooden poles, covered by a white fabric liner. The space is furnished with a small kitchenette area featuring a wooden countertop, a white mini-fridge, and a black electric kettle. Other furniture includes a blue armchair holding a brown furry pillow, a blue chest of drawers, and a light-wood chest of drawers decorated with small Christmas-themed figures. A white electric heater is mounted on the wall, and a black and orange backpack rests on the dark floor near a wooden door. As the person approaches the key hanging on the wall, the camera continues to pan right while moving forward, then pans left to center the key in the frame, finishing with a forward movement. A person's light-skinned hand appears, approaching a padlock beside a light blue tag, attempting to remove it from a wooden hook on the wall.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves around the interior of a cozy, furnished yurt. The structure features distinctive wooden lattice walls and radiating roof rafters, with a white fabric liner visible behind the woodwork. The space is decorated with modern furniture, including a blue armchair, a blue chest of drawers, and natural wood drawers. A small kitchenette area contains a mini-fridge under a wooden countertop, along with a black electric kettle. A white electric heater is mounted on the wall, and festive decorations, including small gnomes and a decorative tree, are placed on the furniture. The camera movement concludes near a wooden door, where a hand reaches out to touch a padlock hanging from a rustic holder on the wall.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
