    "pre_caption": "Mounted on the side of an off-road vehicle, the camera captures a tilted, wide-angle view, creating a diagonal composition. A medium shot of the vehicle and its driver occupies the right and bottom-right of the frame, remaining fixed in this position in the middle ground. The steep, unpaved path stretches from the bottom-left foreground into the middle ground, while the barren mountainside rises in the background on the right. The overcast sky fills the top-left of the frame, with the sun visible as a bright spot in the upper-left quadrant. As the vehicle drives forward, the entire landscape, from the foreground path to the background mountain, appears to rotate around the fixed perspective of the car, while the camera's angle shifts slightly, causing the diagonal orientation of the scene to change dynamically.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A black, open-frame off-road vehicle is positioned on the right side of the view. The vehicle features a prominent black roll cage, large knobby tires, and a yellow bag secured to a metal rack on its roof. Inside the vehicle, a person is seated in the driver's position, wearing a full-face helmet. The helmet is decorated with a blue, red, and white pattern. The driver is also wearing a dark-colored shirt and is oriented forward, looking ahead.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot, where the camera is mounted to an object keeping its perspective fixed, follows a black open-frame off-road vehicle driving along a steep, unpaved path on the side of a barren mountain. The rugged terrain consists of dirt, gravel, and scattered rocks. Inside the vehicle, a driver wearing a blue, red, and white helmet is visible. The sky above is overcast with dense white and grey clouds, through which the sun shines as a bright, diffused spot. The camera's rolling creates a varying Dutch angle, giving a dynamic sense of scene rotation.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: Mounted on the side of an off-road vehicle, the camera captures the scenery ahead along with a medium shot of the car and its occupants, positioned on the right side of the frame, leaving more space for the wide shot of the landscape.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
