    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium full shot of a man in a dark leather jacket, positioned in the center-left of the frame and in the middle ground. To his right, a sink is visible in the foreground, while a graffiti-covered wall is on the far left in the middle ground. In the background, the word \"RELAX\" is written on the top-center wall. The man, seen from behind, walks away from the camera and into a stall on the left, moving deeper into the background. As he does so, the framing changes to a full shot. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man, seen from the back, is shown in a dimly lit, dark environment. He is wearing a dark leather jacket. His figure is mostly in shadow as he walks away from the viewer and into a narrow, dark bathroom stall. Due to the low lighting and the camera angle, his other features are not discernible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a dark, grimy, and confined indoor space, resembling a dilapidated public restroom. A single, cool-toned light source from an overhead vent casts harsh shadows, illuminating dirty walls covered in dark graffiti. The space is divided by dark partitions, and a simple, wall-mounted sink with tarnished faucets is visible on the right. On the back wall, the word \"RELAX\" is painted in black letters. A figure wearing a dark jacket is seen from behind, entering a bathroom stall.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
