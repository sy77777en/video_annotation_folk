    "pre_caption": "This extreme close-up, static shot centers on a weevil resting on a green leaf. The weevil's head and prominent snout occupy the foreground in the center of the frame, while its body extends toward the top of the frame into the middle ground. The vibrant green leaf it sits on fills the entire frame, serving as the surface in the foreground and middle ground. The camera is positioned at a slightly high angle, looking down at the weevil.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A close-up, macro view shows a weevil resting on a bright green leaf. The insect has a dark, textured body with a mottled pattern of yellowish-gold scales, particularly on its head and thorax. A long, dark snout, or rostrum, extends downward from its head. On either side of the head are large, dark, compound eyes. A pair of elbowed antennae with clubbed ends protrudes from the snout. The weevil's dark, segmented legs are visible, positioned on the surface of the leaf.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A macro view captures a weevil positioned on a vibrant green leaf. The insect has a dark, textured exoskeleton with a golden-brown coloration and a pitted surface. Its head features large, dark compound eyes and a long, prominent snout extending downwards. The leaf beneath it is smooth, with a few small white specks visible on its surface. The scene is illuminated by bright, direct light, which creates distinct highlights on the weevil's body and legs.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: Due to the limited surrounding content, it's difficult to determine the camera height.",
