    "pre_caption": "In a static full shot, a large, wrecked submarine is positioned slightly left of the center, occupying the middle ground and angled diagonally from the bottom left toward the upper right. A makeshift settlement is built around the submarine's midsection, also in the middle ground. To the right of the settlement, several vehicles are parked in the middle ground. Numerous wind turbines are scattered across the scene; some are in the middle ground to the left and right of the submarine, while one is positioned in the bottom right foreground. The entire scene is set on vast white sand dunes that extend from the foreground to the background, where a range of mountains is visible across the top of the frame. The camera is positioned high above the subjects, providing an aerial perspective.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a vast landscape of white sand dunes, a large, dark, and heavily rusted submarine lies wrecked and partially buried. Its hull is broken in several places, and a makeshift settlement is built around its midsection, consisting of small, white-painted shacks, wooden platforms, and scaffolding. Several old, rugged vehicles, including a green truck and what appears to be a mobile launcher, are parked near the settlement. Numerous small, skeletal wind turbines with lattice towers are scattered across the dunes, some standing on their own and others mounted on wheeled bases.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a drone POV showing an aerial view of a vast desert landscape with rolling sand dunes under a clear blue sky. In the center, a large, weathered submarine is partially buried in the sand, surrounded by a cluster of makeshift structures and equipment. These structures are composed of various materials, including metal and wood, and are scattered around the submarine, suggesting a settlement or outpost. The scene is devoid of vegetation, emphasizing the arid environment. In the background, a range of rocky mountains adds depth to the setting. The overall atmosphere is one of isolation and desolation, with the sun casting sharp shadows across the sand.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
