    "pre_caption": "This wide shot frames a narrow city street from behind a large, grey, textured pillar that occupies the right foreground. In the middle ground, a black coupe is parked on the left, with a grey sedan positioned behind it toward the center of the frame. The street, lined with multi-story brick buildings on the left, recedes into the background. A person walks from the background on the left side of the street toward the middle ground in the center. The camera remains static at an eye-level position.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video depicts an urban street scene with several parked cars and a few people walking along the sidewalk. The street is lined with multi-story buildings featuring a mix of red, beige, blue, green, and brown brick facades. Three cars are visible along the street. A man in a white shirt is positioned near the black car and is walking out of the frame to the left. Another person, partially obscured, is walking from the right to the left along the sidewalk. The overall atmosphere is urban and slightly overcast, with the buildings and cars being the primary focus of this scenery shot.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A view down a paved city street is framed by a large, grey, textured part of a building in the right foreground. Multi-story buildings with aged brick and painted facades line the alley. On the left, a red brick building with white-trimmed windows sits beside a green one. A black coupe is parked in front of a grey sedan along the left side of the road, which is detailed with metal grates. The scene is set during the day, with muted, desaturated lighting suggesting an overcast sky or deep shade cast by the tall structures.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
