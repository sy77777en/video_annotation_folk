    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a blurry medium shot, showing the woman's upper body on the left side of the frame against an out-of-focus forest background. She runs from the left towards the right and into the foreground, moving closer to the camera. As she advances, the focus sharpens on her, and the framing transitions dynamically from a medium shot to a close-up that captures her head and upper torso. The shot ends with her positioned in the center-left of the frame, while the blurred trees remain in the middle ground and background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout the entire sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young adult woman with fair skin and long, wavy, platinum blonde hair appears in the video. She is dressed in a black jacket over a white top and wears a thick, black collar around her neck. Initially seen as a blurry figure, she comes into sharp focus as she moves, revealing an alert expression on her face as she looks from side to side. The shot transitions from a medium view to a close-up, focusing on her face and upper torso.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dimly lit forest during what appears to be dusk or on an overcast day. The background is composed of tall, out-of-focus trees with dense, dark green foliage, creating a soft, blurred environment. A woman with blonde hair, dressed in a dark jacket and wearing a thick, dark collar, is seen moving through the woods. The camera movement is relatively smooth, with only minimal shaking, enhancing the overall viewing experience as it follows her, and the focus shifts from an initial blur to a clearer, though still soft, view of the subject.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a white-haired woman running through a forest. It begins out of focus, with the blurry woman's upper body visible on the left side of the frame. As she runs closer to the camera, she becomes in focus, and her size dynamically changes within the frame. The video ends with a close-up of the woman.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
