    "pre_caption": "A close-up shot frames a woman in the center of the screen. Initially, a blurred hand is visible in the right foreground, partially obscuring the view before it moves out of the frame to the right. The woman remains centrally positioned throughout the shot. In the background, a blue couch and a framed mirror are visible in the left midground, while a dining table and chairs are situated in the center background. The camera is positioned at the woman's eye level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **At the beginning of the video, a woman with light brown skin and curly, light brown hair has her blurred hand near the camera before moving it away. Her head is slightly tilted, and she has a relaxed yet focused expression with her mouth slightly open. She is wearing a black turtleneck shirt and small gold hoop earrings. Her hair is pulled back, with several curly tendrils framing her face. As she moves her hand away, she straightens her head, and her expression becomes more serious, with her mouth closing slightly, though not completely.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place indoors in a modern, softly lit living space with neutral-colored walls and large windows adorned with white curtains that allow natural daylight to filter in. In the background, a dining area is visible against a large window, featuring a rectangular table surrounded by several blue chairs, with a modern pendant light hanging above. The room is minimally decorated, with a framed mirror on the left wall and a blue couch positioned against it, accompanied by a glass door on the far left. On the far right, there is a piece of dark furniture against the wall. The overall atmosphere is calm and uncluttered, with smooth surfaces and a muted color palette dominated by shades of gray, white, blue, and black. The lighting is diffuse, creating gentle shadows and a subdued ambiance throughout the space.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
