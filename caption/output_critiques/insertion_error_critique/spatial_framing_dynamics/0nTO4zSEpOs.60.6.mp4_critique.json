    "pre_caption": "The video opens with an extreme wide, high-angle shot of a city intersection at night. In the middle ground, a red and white bus is positioned in the bottom left, while a line of dark cars is queued on the right side of the road. Illuminated high-rise buildings, including the Tokyu Plaza on the left, occupy the background. The camera then pans left and moves forward, transitioning into a wide, eye-level shot from the perspective of someone walking on an elevated pedestrian walkway. In this new frame, the walkway and its railing are in the foreground, with a pedestrian in a light blue shirt walking from right to left. Other pedestrians walk forward in the middle ground, while the street with traffic is now visible below to the right. The camera continues to move forward at a walking pace, with the city buildings now framing the scene from the left and right. A watermark is present in the bottom left corner.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a bustling city scene at night from an elevated walkway. Numerous pedestrians are seen walking along the bridge and on the sidewalks below. The streets are filled with vehicles, including a prominent red and white bus with Japanese characters on its side, visible in the lower left next to a small white truck. On the right side of the road, a long line of dark-colored cars, likely taxis, and other buses are queued up.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a bustling urban scene in Shibuya, Tokyo, at night. The view begins from a high vantage point overlooking a busy bus terminal before transitioning to a walk along an elevated pedestrian skywalk. The area is surrounded by modern high-rise buildings, including the dark-paneled Tokyu Plaza, which are illuminated by bright interior lights and large digital billboards displaying Japanese characters. Below the walkway, which has a grey tiled floor and metal railings, traffic including red and white buses and a queue of taxis moves through the complex road system. Other pedestrians can be seen walking along the skywalk. A watermark for 'VIRTUAL JAPAN.TV' is positioned in the bottom left corner.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with an extreme wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.",
