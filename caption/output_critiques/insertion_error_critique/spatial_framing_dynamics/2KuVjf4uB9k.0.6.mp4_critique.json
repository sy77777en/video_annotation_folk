    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a black sports car drifting on an expansive asphalt track. Initially, the car is positioned slightly off-center towards the left in the foreground, with the camera capturing it from above. As the car drifts, it moves dynamically across the frame, transitioning from the left to the right side while maintaining its presence in the foreground. The car's orientation shifts, revealing different angles of its sleek design. The white smoke trails behind the car, expanding from the bottom right towards the center of the frame. The surrounding arid, rocky terrain forms the background, remaining static as the car maneuvers. The camera maintains a consistent height above the car, providing a clear overhead view of the drifting action and the track's surface. The shot size remains wide throughout, ensuring the car and its movement remain the focal point against the open backdrop.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a black sports car with prominent branding, including a large \"NOS\" logo on the side. The car has a sleek, aerodynamic design with visible modifications, such as a rear spoiler and racing decals. It is producing a significant amount of white smoke from its tires, indicating high-speed drifting. The car's dynamic movement and the smoke trail emphasize its speed and agility. The vehicle's orientation changes, showcasing its drifting capability on a wide, open track.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, filmed by a drone, captures an outdoor setting on a dry, expansive asphalt track surrounded by arid, rocky terrain. The time of day is bright, likely midday, with clear skies casting strong sunlight over the scene. A car is prominently featured, drifting across the track, creating thick plumes of white smoke that trail behind it. The car is sleek, with a dark body and vibrant decals, including a notable logo on the side. The surrounding landscape is barren, with sandy hills in the background, emphasizing the desolate environment. The drone's perspective provides a dynamic view of the car's movement, highlighting the speed and precision of the drift against the stark, open backdrop.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subject’s framing (shot size) is not stable** throughout the video, so the description should emphasize this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
