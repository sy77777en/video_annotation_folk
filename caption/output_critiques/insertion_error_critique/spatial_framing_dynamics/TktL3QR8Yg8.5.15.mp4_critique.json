    "pre_caption": "A young boy is featured in a close-up shot, positioned in the center of the frame and occupying the foreground. Behind him, the background is dark and out of focus, containing indistinct shapes. The boy initially looks forward, then briefly lowers his head and gaze before looking up again toward the center. The camera remains stationary and is positioned at the boy's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young boy with pale skin and short, dark, messy hair is shown in a close-up. He has large, light-colored eyes with prominent dark circles underneath, and he is wearing a dark, collared shirt with a subtle ribbed texture. His expression is somber and shifts subtly throughout the video; his eyes are initially wide and his mouth is slightly agape, then he looks down with a sad expression before looking up again with furrowed brows and a worried frown.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dark, indistinct environment, with the background composed of blurred, dark shapes. The lighting is dim, with a single source illuminating the central subject from the front, casting soft shadows. The overall color palette is muted and cool, dominated by shades of gray and black. The focus remains fixed on a young, animated boy with dark hair and large eyes. Initially, he gazes straight ahead, then lowers his head, raises it again to look forward, looks down, and finally looks up once more. Ultimately, he hands a circular object to the camera using both hands.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
