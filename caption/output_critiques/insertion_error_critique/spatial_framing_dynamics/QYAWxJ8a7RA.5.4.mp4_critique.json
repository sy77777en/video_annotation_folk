    "pre_caption": "This full shot is centered on a large warning sign positioned in the foreground, slightly left of the frame's center. The sign's metal pole extends down towards the bottom of the frame. To the right of the sign, large, dark piles of tailings occupy the middle ground. In the background, reddish-brown rocky hills are visible on both the left and right sides of the frame, with a clear blue sky at the top. Sparse green shrubs are scattered throughout the middle ground. A text overlay is present in the bottom left corner. The camera is positioned at the sign's level, and the entire scene remains static.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video prominently features a warning sign that reads \"ASBESTOS TAILINGS RISK AREA\" with a red triangle containing an exclamation mark, indicating danger. The sign warns about the risks of inhaling asbestos fibers, which may cause cancer, and advises avoiding dusty situations and keeping children away from the tailings. The sign is mounted on a metal pole and is positioned in a natural setting with rocky terrain and sparse vegetation. The landscape includes reddish-brown rock formations and some green shrubs, suggesting a dry, possibly desert-like environment. The sign is the central focus, emphasizing the hazardous nature of the area.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an outdoor setting in a rugged, arid landscape characterized by rocky terrain and sparse vegetation. The scene is dominated by a prominent warning sign that reads \"ASBESTOS TAILINGS RISK AREA\" with a red triangle and exclamation mark, cautioning about the dangers of inhaling asbestos fibers. The sign is mounted on a metal pole and stands against a backdrop of reddish-brown hills and mounds of dark, dusty material, likely tailings. The sky is mostly clear with some clouds, indicating a sunny day. The environment suggests a remote, possibly abandoned mining area. Overlay elements include a small watermark in the bottom left corner, displaying text that reads \"[S] [State Library of Western Australia]\" and the year \"1978\".**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
