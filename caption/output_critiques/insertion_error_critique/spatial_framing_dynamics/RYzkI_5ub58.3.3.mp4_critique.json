    "pre_caption": "This medium shot features a black bird, facing left, positioned slightly to the right of the frame's center and occupying the middle ground. Green leaves are visible in the foreground, primarily at the bottom of the frame, surrounding the bird. The background consists of a clear, bright blue sky that fills the upper portion of the scene. The camera appears to be below the subject, though the lack of background information makes this difficult to determine with certainty. The framing remains static throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a black bird with a pointed, pale grey beak. The bird has a distinct red patch on its wing, with a white stripe directly beneath the red patch. Its feathers appear somewhat textured, particularly around its neck. The bird is perched, facing towards the left, with its head level. Below and around the bird are several green leaves, indicating it is positioned within a plant or tree.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows a black bird with a white beak and a red and white patch on its wing, perched among green leaves against a clear, bright blue sky. The setting is outdoors during the daytime.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera appears to be below the subject, but it lacks background information, making it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",
