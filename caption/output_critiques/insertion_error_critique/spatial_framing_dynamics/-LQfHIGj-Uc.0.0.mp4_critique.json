    "pre_caption": "This point-of-view video begins with a low-angle shot where the upper body of a person is visible in the top left foreground. A shotgun extends from the bottom left foreground toward the center, aimed up at the blue sky that fills the background, with tall reeds visible in the bottom right. The camera then pivots upward and forward, causing the person's body to move out of the frame and shifting the perspective to an eye-level view. In the final framing, the shotgun barrel occupies the foreground, extending from the bottom toward the center, with a hand gripping it in the bottom center. The middle ground is filled with a field of tall reeds, while low hills on the horizon and the sky form the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases a fixed camera view focused on a person wearing a camouflage-patterned hat and jacket in shades of brown, tan, and dark green. The person holds a semi-automatic shotgun, which is also covered in a matching camouflage pattern. Initially, the gun is held low, with the person's head and shoulder visible. The shotgun is then raised into an aiming position, causing the person's upper body to move out of the frame. The view remains centered on the long barrel of the shotgun and a light-skinned hand gripping its fore-end.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot from a camera mounted on a shotgun provides a view from within a dense field of tall, dry reeds under a clear blue sky with a few wispy clouds. The camouflage-patterned barrel of the gun, held by a person in matching attire, points forward as the perspective shifts, scanning the sunlit, marshy landscape. In the distance, beyond the golden-brown vegetation, a line of low, rolling hills is visible on the horizon.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: In this video, the camera is mounted on a gun. At the beginning, both the gun barrel and the upper body of a person are visible. Then, as the gun is raised and aimed forward, the person moves out of the frame, leaving only the hand holding the gun, the gun barrel, and a field landscape in view.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
