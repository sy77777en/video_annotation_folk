    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot, capturing the main subject from the waist up. The man is positioned in the center-left of the frame, in the foreground, while the other man is slightly to the right, also in the foreground. Both are seated at a table. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to a medium close-up, focusing more closely on the upper bodies and faces of the two men. The main subject remains in the center-left, actively using the fan attached to chopsticks, while the second man stays to the right, observing. In the background, other diners are seated at tables, scattered across the middle ground, with some visible in the top left and top right areas. The intricate wall art and decorative elements are consistently visible in the background, framing the scene. The camera maintains a level height relative to the subjects throughout, keeping their actions and expressions clearly in view.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man as the main subject, seated at a table in a restaurant. He has short dark hair and is wearing a beige short-sleeved shirt. He is engaged in an unusual action, using a portable electric fan attached to chopsticks to cool the noodles while eating with chopsticks. His expression is focused on the task. To his left, another man with short dark hair and glasses, wearing a yellow shirt, watches with a shocked expression. The setting is a busy dining area with decorative wall art. The main focus is on the man's unique method of eating, with the surrounding people providing context and reactions.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor restaurant setting with a warm, inviting atmosphere. The environment features several tables with white tablecloths, occupied by patrons enjoying their meals. The walls are adorned with large, intricate artworks that add a cultural touch to the space. The lighting is soft, creating a cozy ambiance. The carpeted floor complements the overall decor, enhancing the restaurant's traditional style. Notable visual elements include a man at a table, engaged in an animated manner with his meal, adding a dynamic aspect to the otherwise calm setting. The scene captures a lively yet relaxed dining experience, with people conversing and enjoying their food.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
