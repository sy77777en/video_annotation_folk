    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, a woman stands in the center of the frame in the middle ground, with a drum positioned directly in front of her in the center foreground on an asphalt road. She holds a water balloon in the center of the frame and drops it downwards toward the drum. As the balloon falls, it remains in the center of the frame, moving from the middle ground to the foreground. Upon impact, the balloon bursts, and a splash of water erupts upwards and outwards from the drum's central position, momentarily occupying the lower half of the frame. In the background, a road recedes, bordered by trees. The camera remains stationary at the woman's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with long, dark brown hair, wearing a teal long-sleeved top and black leggings, stands outdoors. She holds a large, teal water balloon with both hands and then drops it toward a drum positioned on the ground in front of her. The drum has a tan-colored body, a silver rim, and a yellowish-green drumhead. As the balloon falls, the woman's facial expression is slightly contorted due to exertion. Upon impact with the drum, the balloon bursts, sending a large splash of white, foamy water upwards.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene unfolds on an asphalt road in a residential area, bordered by a grassy curb. In the background, a line of green trees stands before a partly cloudy sky, with a chain-link fence visible in the distance. Positioned in the foreground on the pavement is a tan-colored drum with a yellow-green rim. A turquoise water balloon is dropped onto the drum, bursting upon impact and sending a white, frothy splash of water into the air.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
