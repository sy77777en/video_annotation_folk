    "pre_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of a man, who is consistently positioned in the center foreground, holding a metal object near his face, also in the center foreground. The camera is at the subject's level. A double dolly technique is employed: the man maintains his fixed size and central position within the frame through synchronized movement, moving backward as the camera moves forward. As a result, the background elements—an urban street extending from the center, flanked by buildings in the left and right background, trees in the left and right middle ground to background, a fence in the left middle ground, and parked cars in the left middle ground and right background—continuously move past him. This creates a dynamic visual effect where the surrounding environment appears to flow around the subject, who remains the central focus. A text overlay is visible in the bottom center foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A dark-skinned man with a goatee is shown from the chest up, facing forward. He wears a brown fedora hat with a black band, dark sunglasses, and a rust-colored collared shirt or jacket. He holds a metal object that conforms to the shape of his hand in his left hand, close to his face.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set on a sunlit urban street, lined with multi-story brownstone-style buildings on both sides. Trees with green foliage are present on both sides as well. A dark, possibly wrought-iron fence extends from the foreground to the middle ground on the left. Parked cars, including a maroon sedan on the left and another vehicle further down the street on the right, are visible. The camera appears to be moving backward along the sidewalk. An overlay at the bottom of the screen displays white text: \"First Double Dolly: Mo Better Blues (1990)\".**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
