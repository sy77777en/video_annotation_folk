    "pre_caption": "In a static wide shot, a stop-motion figure of a young girl is positioned in the center-left of the frame, seated on the floor in the middle ground. In front of her, also in the middle ground, are a dark satchel and scattered papers. To the bottom left, a small woven basket sits in the foreground, establishing depth. Further back and to the right of the center, another figure of an older woman is seated in the out-of-focus background. A green bucket is visible in the middle ground on the right, while a faintly glowing lantern is situated in the background on the left. The camera remains stationary at the seated girl's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dimly lit setting, a stop-motion figure of a young girl with brown skin sits cross-legged on the floor in the middleground. She has long, dark hair styled in two braids and wears a simple, light-colored sleeveless dress. Her most distinct feature is her face, which has large, round, button-like eyes. She holds an open book in her lap and a thin stick in her hand. In the background and out of focus, another stop-motion figure of an older woman is seated. This figure wears an orange garment, and her facial features are similarly stylized with a long face and round eyes.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place in a dimly lit, cluttered interior room with a rough, uneven floor, likely at night. The middle ground is illuminated by a warm, soft light from an invisible source, while the rest of the space remains in deep shadow, and a small lantern provides a faint glow in the background. The room is filled with various household items, including small woven baskets, scattered papers, a dark satchel, and a green bucket. In the middle ground, a stop-motion puppet of a young girl with dark, braided hair sits on the floor, looking at an open book. Another puppet figure is seated in the softly lit, out-of-focus background.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
