    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide shot capturing a cityscape from a high aerial perspective. Initially, a prominent brick building with a dome is positioned in the center-right middle ground, with a tall church spire located in the left middle ground. Other buildings populate the foreground, middle ground, and background, with streets visible below. Hills and a body of water are visible in the distant background. The camera moves forward and slightly left. Consequently, the domed building shifts towards the right side of the frame, remaining in the middle ground, while the spire moves further towards the left edge, also in the middle ground. The overall view expands slightly, revealing more of the city to the left and in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot. It captures an urban environment with a focus on the architectural elements and the overall atmosphere of the city. The camera work highlights the scale and layout of the city, showcasing a prominent building with a dome and a tall spire, as well as surrounding structures. The emphasis is on the interplay of light and shadow across the buildings, with the distant hills and a body of water adding depth to the scene. The lack of a specific main subject allows the viewer to appreciate the broader cityscape and its ambiance.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a drone POV showing an aerial view of a small urban area during the day. The setting features a mix of historic and modern architecture, with prominent buildings including a multi-story structure with arched windows and a dome, and a tall, pointed church steeple. The streets below are lined with trees, and a few vehicles are visible, with light traffic flowing smoothly along the roads, indicating a calm urban activity. In the background, rolling hills and a body of water can be seen, suggesting a scenic landscape surrounding the town. The lighting is bright, with the sun casting long shadows, indicating a clear day. The overall scene combines urban and natural elements, providing a comprehensive view of the town's layout and its surroundings.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
