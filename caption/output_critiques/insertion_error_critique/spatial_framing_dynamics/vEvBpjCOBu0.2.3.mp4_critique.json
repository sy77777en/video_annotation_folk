    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot of an industrial complex, with no primary subject. The camera is positioned at a low angle, looking up at the structures. A large, multi-story factory building dominates the center of the frame in the middle ground, with a tall smokestack rising behind it on the left. To the right, intricate piping and another building extend into the background. The bottom of the frame is occupied by the tops of containers in the foreground. The camera executes a slow dolly movement from left to right, causing the foreground elements to drift across the screen and gradually revealing more of the industrial architecture on the right side of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is an industrial cityscape scenery shot. It focuses on the environment and atmosphere, highlighting the scale and complexity of industrial structures. The scene features large, metallic buildings with intricate piping and machinery, reflecting a utilitarian design. The lighting casts dramatic shadows, emphasizing the textures and geometric forms of the architecture. The absence of a main subject directs attention to the overall industrial landscape, creating a sense of vastness and functionality.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows an industrial setting with large, metallic structures and machinery, likely a factory or power plant. The scene is outdoors, featuring several buildings with corrugated metal siding and large glass windows. The architecture includes tall chimneys and complex piping systems, suggesting heavy industry. The time of day appears to be late afternoon, as the sunlight casts long shadows and highlights the metallic surfaces with a warm glow. The sky is overcast, adding a muted tone to the environment. The structures are characterized by their geometric shapes and industrial materials, such as steel and glass, with visible textures like rivets and paneling. Overlay text in the bottom left corner reads \"[14] ; DW News - Luther and the Chemicals Industry (2013)\" but is not integrated into the scene and does not provide additional context.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
