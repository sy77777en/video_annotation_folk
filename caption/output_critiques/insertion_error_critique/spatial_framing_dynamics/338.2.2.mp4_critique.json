    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a woman in a maroon vest over a white shirt, positioned in the center of the frame and in the foreground. The camera is at her eye level. As the camera swiftly pans to the right, the shot size remains a medium shot, now focusing on a woman in a yellow garment seated slightly to the right and also in the foreground. The camera maintains its eye-level position. Continuing the pan, the next subject, an older man in a maroon shirt, appears further to the right and in the middle ground. Finally, the camera stops on a woman in a maroon vest with golden-yellow trim, located in the center-right of the frame and in the foreground. She holds chopsticks over a plate, remaining stationary while speaking. Throughout the sequence, the background consistently features the restaurant's interior, including framed paintings on the walls and a chandelier, which remain static in the upper part of the frame. The camera's movement is smooth, transitioning from one subject to the next without altering its height or angle.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a swift pan to the right, revealing several individuals in a dining setting. Initially, the camera focuses on a woman wearing a maroon vest over a white shirt with a black bow tie, who has a medium skin tone and dark, tied-up hair, suggesting she might be a server. The focus then shifts to a woman in a yellow garment, with a medium skin tone and medium-length hair. Following this, an older man with glasses and short hair, dressed in a maroon shirt, is shown. Lastly, the camera highlights a woman in a maroon burgundy vest with golden-yellow trim over a black long-sleeve shirt, with dark medium-length hair. She is holding chopsticks over a plate . Although she remains stationary, she is speaking, indicating an interaction with the meal and the people around her.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows a group of people sitting around a table in a restaurant, with plates of food and glasses of drink in front of them. The camera starts by focusing on a person in a red vest and white shirt, who is sitting at the table with a plate of food and a glass of drink. As the camera pans to the right, it reveals more people at the table, including a person in a yellow outfit and another in a red shirt, both engaged in eating. The camera continues to pan right, showing another person in a red vest and black shirt, who is also eating. The background features the interior settings of the restaurant, including framed paintings on the decorated walls, tables with white tablecloths, and a refined, opulent ceiling featuring a delicate chandelier, as the camera pans from left to right.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a medium shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",
