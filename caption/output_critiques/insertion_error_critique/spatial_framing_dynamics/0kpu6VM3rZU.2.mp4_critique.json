    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium close-up shot of a woman positioned in the foreground, centered in the frame. She holds a trophy and speaks into a microphone. As the camera gradually zooms out, transitioning to a medium shot, another woman enters the frame from the left side, standing beside the first woman. The second woman, also in the foreground, holds a microphone labeled \"ET Canada\" and gestures while conversing. Both women face each other, engaging in dialogue. In the background, a crowd of formally dressed individuals is visible, scattered across the middle ground and extending towards the backdrop of large, modern buildings and decorative elements. The camera remains at the subjects' eye level throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective. The setting includes a red carpet and transparent curtains, contributing to the formal event atmosphere. The \"ET Canada\" logo is consistently displayed in the bottom left corner, anchoring the broadcast context. The camera's movement from a close-up to a wider shot effectively captures the interaction between the two women while keeping the lively event environment in view.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a medium close-up of a woman with long, straight black hair, wearing a metallic-colored dress and large hoop earrings. She is holding a trophy and appears to be speaking. As the camera zooms out, another woman is revealed. This second woman has long, wavy brown hair and is wearing a dress with intricate lace detailing. She is holding a microphone labeled \"ET Canada\" and gesturing with her hands. Both women are engaged in conversation, facing each other, with the setting suggesting a formal event or interview.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor event in a bustling urban setting, likely during the early evening, as indicated by the artificial lighting and the slightly bright building in the background. The scene is set at a red carpet event, with a backdrop of large, modern buildings and decorative elements like banners. The environment is lively, with a crowd of people dressed in formal attire, suggesting a glamorous occasion. The broadcast POV shot is set up for television production, focusing on interactions between individuals. Notable visual elements include transparent curtains. Overlays in the video include a logo and text reading \"ET Canada\" at the bottom left, indicating the broadcast source.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The scene starts with a medium close-up shot focus on one woman, with the camera zooming out to reveal two women in a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
