    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot, capturing a man in black mid-flip in the middle ground center, positioned over a wooden cart on the left. A crouching figure is in the foreground at the bottom center, with traditional buildings lining the street on the left and right from the middle ground into the background. As the man in black completes his flip and moves toward the camera, the shot tightens into a medium shot, keeping him in the center. He then approaches a palanquin, which enters from the right background and moves to the center, and he ducks underneath it as it passes. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man in modern clothing performing acrobatic flips down a street reminiscent of historical Japan. He is dressed entirely in black, with a short-sleeved t-shirt, pants, and a backward baseball cap. He interacts with several people in period-appropriate Japanese attire. Initially, two men are seen preparing to lift a handcart loaded with bundles of grass wrapped in straw mats. Later, two different men carry a palanquin with a woman seated inside. Various onlookers in traditional robes and kimonos are present, wearing simple, loose-fitting garments and some with headbands. The scene captures the modern man's dynamic movements amidst the historically dressed individuals.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set on a wide street in a historical Japanese village under an overcast sky. The street is lined with traditional two-story wooden buildings featuring dark tiled roofs, white plaster walls, and dark wood framing. Purple fabric banners, one marked with a white circular crest, hang over the entrances of the shops. The road is a mix of worn pavement and dirt, with gravel along the edges. In the background, green trees are visible on a slight incline. Various props populate the scene, including a two-wheeled wooden cart carrying a large bundle wrapped in a grass mat, and a wooden palanquin being carried by two men. Other people in period-style clothing are positioned along the street, some standing and others walking.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
