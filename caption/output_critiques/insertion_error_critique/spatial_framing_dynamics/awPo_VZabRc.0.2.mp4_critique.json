    "pre_caption": "The video presents a full shot, maintaining a static frame throughout. In the center middle ground, a green reptilian creature with an atypically wide-open mouth is seated. To its left in the middle ground, a person in a light blue hooded sweatshirt stands, with a woman in a light pink top to their right, and further right, a person in a yellow shirt holding a paper. To the creature's right in the middle ground, a partially visible person wears a red and dark striped top. The immediate right foreground shows the back and shoulder of another individual. Indistinct figures and rows of seats occupy the background. The camera is positioned at approximately eye level with the subjects.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a dark-haired man seated sideways to the camera, his head lowered as he attends to his right foot, which is resting on his left knee. As the scene progresses, he transforms into a cartoonish, green reptilian creature characterized by an atypically distorted and extremely wide-open mouth that stretches unnaturally. Inside its mouth are numerous sharp, white teeth and a long, dark, curling tongue. The creature has large, yellow eyes with black pupils, several light-colored horns or spikes adorning its head and jawline, and long, light-colored claws on its hands, which are positioned in front of its chest. To the left of this creature, a person is depicted wearing a light blue hooded sweatshirt, dark pants, and white shoes, standing with hands in pockets. Beside them, a woman with short, dark hair is shown in a light pink top and a darker pink or purple skirt. On the woman’s right stands a person wearing a yellow shirt and dark pants, holding a folded white paper—possibly a newspaper. To the creature's right, a portion of another person is visible, wearing a red and dark horizontally striped top and green pants. In the immediate right foreground, the back and shoulder of a fifth individual are seen, clad in a dark jacket with a light blue hood or collar detail.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an animated indoor scene, likely a subway car or train, from an objective point of view. The setting is characterized by rows of seats, with several indistinct figures of passengers visible in the background. One prominent figure is a green, monstrous creature transformed from a human, featuring large, sharp teeth, a long tongue, and spiky protrusions, seated among the passengers. The overall art style is cartoonish, with bold outlines and a somewhat muted color palette. The scene is static, with no significant movement or changes.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.",
