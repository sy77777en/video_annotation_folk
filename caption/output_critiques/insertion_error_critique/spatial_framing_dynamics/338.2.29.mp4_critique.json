    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot capturing multiple subjects and the surrounding restaurant environment. The main focus is on two women seated at a table in the foreground, positioned centrally in the frame. The woman with long dark hair and glasses, wearing a maroon vest, is on the left side of the frame, while the woman in the denim jacket is on the right. Both are in the foreground, with the table and its contents between them. In the background, other patrons and a staff member in a white shirt and maroon vest are visible, moving through the middle ground. The camera then transitions to a medium close-up shot, focusing more closely on the two women. The woman with dark hair is now more prominently on the left, and the woman in the denim jacket is on the right. The table remains in the foreground, but less of the surrounding restaurant is visible. The camera maintains a level height relative to the subjects throughout, keeping the focus on their upper bodies and interactions.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a restaurant scene with a focus on a woman with long dark hair and glasses, wearing a maroon vest over a white shirt, who is eating an ice cream cone. Next to her, a woman in a denim jacket with light hair styled with volume is engaged in conversation while holding chopsticks in her right hand and gesturing with her left hand. The table is set with plates and drinks, indicating a meal in progress. In the background, other patrons and staff are visible, including a man in a white shirt and maroon vest walking past. The setting is a busy dining area with decorative wall art, creating a lively atmosphere.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set in a cozy, warmly lit indoor restaurant with a classic, slightly ornate decor. The environment features round tables covered with white tablecloths, surrounded by dark wooden chairs with cushioned seats. The walls are adorned with intricate, gold-toned decorative panels and artwork, adding a touch of elegance. The setting is lively, with patrons seated at tables, engaged in conversation and dining. The time of day is likely evening, suggested by the indoor lighting and relaxed atmosphere. Notable visual elements include a variety of dishes and drinks on the tables, and the presence of waitstaff in uniform, contributing to the bustling yet intimate dining experience.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
