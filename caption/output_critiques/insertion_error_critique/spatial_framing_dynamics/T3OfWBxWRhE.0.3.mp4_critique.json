    "pre_caption": "This wide shot, captured from a subject-level perspective, frames the Trevi Fountain in the background, occupying the upper two-thirds of the frame from the center to the left. A large crowd of people is positioned in the foreground, filling the bottom half of the frame. To the right, a reddish-orange building is visible in the background. The entire scene is static, with no discernible camera movement or change in framing.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In the foreground, a crowd of people is gathered in front of a large, ornate fountain. The crowd is looking towards a massive Baroque fountain integrated into the facade of a large, classical-style building made of light-colored stone. The fountain's central feature is a large statue of a muscular man with a beard standing on a shell, flanked by other statues of figures and horses set among sculpted rocks.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors at the Trevi Fountain in Rome, viewed from within a crowd during what appears to be dusk or an overcast day. The massive Baroque fountain, constructed from light-colored stone, is attached to the facade of the Palazzo Poli. The fountain's centerpiece is a large sculpture of a standing male figure in a central niche, surrounded by other statues and intricate rock formations. The building features classical columns, additional sculptures in niches, and a prominent Latin inscription along the top. In the foreground, numerous people gather to look at the monument. On both sides of the fountain, portions of a reddish-orange residential building with either dark or green-shuttered windows can be seen.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
