    "pre_caption": "This wide shot, filmed from a high angle, captures the interior of a greenhouse. In the foreground and extending into the middle ground, several black irrigation pipes are laid in parallel lines across a bed of tilled soil. A single, small green plant is positioned in the middle ground, slightly to the left of center. Wooden planks are placed perpendicularly over the soil in the right foreground and across the middle ground. In the background, potted flowers sit on the left, with the translucent walls and metal frame of the greenhouse visible behind them. The camera and all elements within the frame remain static.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Inside a greenhouse with a translucent plastic covering and a metal frame, a single, small green plant with large, broad leaves is planted in a bed of dark, tilled soil. Several black irrigation pipes are laid out in parallel lines across the soil, running from the foreground to the background. In the middle ground on the left, several black plastic pots filled with pink and white flowers sit on wooden planks. Additional wooden planks are laid across the soil in various places.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Inside a greenhouse with a curved metal frame and translucent plastic walls, the tilled soil is prepared for planting. Several black irrigation hoses run in parallel lines across the dark soil, with wooden planks laid across them at intervals. A single, small green plant with large leaves grows in one of the rows. In the middle ground on the left, several black pots hold pink and white flowering plants. The scene is brightly and evenly lit.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
