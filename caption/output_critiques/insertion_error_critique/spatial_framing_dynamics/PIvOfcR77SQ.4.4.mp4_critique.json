    "pre_caption": "From a low-angle, first-person perspective, the front of a sled occupies the bottom center foreground, with a hand on a steering wheel visible in the bottom left foreground. The snowy path, marked with tracks, extends from the immediate foreground into the middle ground, filling the lower two-thirds of the frame. This path is flanked by a large snowbank on the right and a snow-covered barrier on the left, both of which stretch from the foreground into the middle ground along the frame's edges. In the background, a dense forest spans the upper portion of the frame, with an overcast sky visible above the treeline. The camera moves continuously forward at a steady pace, creating a dynamic where foreground elements pass quickly while the background remains more distant, emphasizing the sense of movement and depth.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures a snowy landscape from a first-person point of view, showing a person riding a sled with a steering wheel and a ski-like front. The casual forward-facing perspective occasionally reveals the rider's legs. The snow-covered path is surrounded by snowbanks and lined with tall evergreen trees, conveying a sense of movement along a snowy track with the sled's tracks visible in the snow.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot of a snowy outdoor setting, likely a winter landscape. The scene features a snow-covered road flanked by tall snowbanks on either side, with a dense forest of evergreen trees in the background. The sky is overcast, suggesting a cold, cloudy day. The road shows tracks from previous vehicles, indicating recent activity. The viewer's perspective includes parts of a sled or similar vehicle, with a visible steering wheel. The viewer is moving forward along the snowy path. The environment is serene, with the white snow contrasting against the dark green of the trees, creating a stark, wintry atmosphere.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
