    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium lead-tracking shot of a young man walking from a brightly lit doorway in the background center toward the foreground and left side of the frame. As he moves past the camera, the focus shifts to the middle ground, where an older, standing man is visible on the right, and a younger, seated man is in the lower center-right. Both men are gathered around a small, yellow device positioned in the center-right middle ground. A red fire alarm box is mounted on the wall in the right middle ground, and a blue cabinet stands in the background on the right. The shot ends with the initial subject mostly out of frame on the left, leaving the two men in the middle ground as the primary focus. The camera is positioned at the subjects' height throughout the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young, fair-skinned man with short, light-colored hair, wearing a dark gray long-sleeved sweatshirt, walks into a dimly lit room with a concerned expression. As he moves, the focus shifts to the middleground, revealing two other men. One is an older, standing man with graying hair and a mustache, dressed in a dark jacket. Next to him is a younger, seated man wearing a black beanie and a dark shirt. Both men in the middleground are gathered around a small, yellow, submersible-like device.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a dimly lit and cluttered indoor space, resembling a workshop or utility room. The room has a desaturated, cool color palette, contrasted by a warm light source emanating from a doorway in the background. The walls are lined with pipes, wiring, a red fire alarm box, and a blue metal cabinet. Various tools and equipment are visible on shelves and a workbench. In the background, two men are working on a yellow, submersible-like device. A young man in a grey sweatshirt walks from the lit doorway into the main area of the room.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a medium lead-tracking shot of a person walking. As the person exits the frame toward the end, the focus shifts to the background, revealing a man in black standing with most of his body visible except for his feet. In the lower center of the background, another seated man in black appears, showing only his upper torso.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the same height as the subjects initially and at the end.",
