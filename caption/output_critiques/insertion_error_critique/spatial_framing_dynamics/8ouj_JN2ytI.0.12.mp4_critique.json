    "pre_caption": "In a static wide shot captured from a low angle, a group of sports fans occupies the foreground, filling the lower half of the frame. A man in a yellow beanie is positioned in the left-foreground, with other fans arranged horizontally to his right across the middle and right foreground. In the background, a row of large glass windows extends across the top half of the frame, through which other people can be seen in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A group of sports fans are clapping. Many in the crowd wear yellow beanies. A man in the foreground with a goatee wears a black collared jacket over a yellow shirt and a yellow beanie. On his right side in the frame, a man with a darker skin tone wears a black jacket, a yellow scarf, and a black and yellow cap. Further to the right, a man with long dark hair and glasses wears a yellow beanie, and next to him, another man wears a gray baseball cap and a yellow t-shirt. A woman with blonde hair and a yellow beanie is also in the crowd, clapping and smiling, with another blonde-haired person positioned behind her. Reflections of other people are visible in the large glass windows behind the group.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a brightly lit stadium, a group of spectators wearing yellow and black attire, including yellow beanies and scarves, are clapping. Behind them, a modern architectural feature consists of a row of large, rectangular glass windows set in a light-colored frame. Reflections are visible on the glass, and through it, other people can be seen in a suite, also observing and clapping.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
