    "pre_caption": "This close-up shot is framed from a central perspective looking down a dark, textured tunnel. The tunnel's concentric rings fill the entire frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground. In the background, a bright white circle is positioned in the exact center of the frame. Several metallic bolts are arranged in a circular pattern in the middle ground, pointing inward toward the central axis. The only movement is the slow, clockwise, spiraling rotation of the innermost rifled core of the tunnel, located in the middle ground, while the outer rings and the bolts remain static. The camera is positioned at the center of the structure, looking straight down the tunnel.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A dark gray structure is composed of multiple concentric rings, each with a textured, diamond-plate surface. The innermost part of the structure has a different, spiraled or rifled texture, leading to a bright, white, circular smooth plane at the center of the rings. Most of the light gray, metallic bolts with hexagonal heads are evenly distributed across the innermost two concentric rings. Some bolts are not fastened and appear to float, while others are already fastened to the structure, positioned straight against the surface of the rings.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene provides a view of a dark, mechanical structure composed of stable concentric rings. The rings are made of a dark gray material with a textured, diamond-plate surface. Some silver-colored bolts with hexagonal heads are embedded in the rings, while others appear to be floating in the air, pointing inward toward the surface of the rings. The center of the structure features a spiraling texture and culminates in a bright, white, circular plane. The rifled core of the structure shifts with an alternating motion, first spinning counterclockwise, pausing, and then spinning clockwise.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.",
