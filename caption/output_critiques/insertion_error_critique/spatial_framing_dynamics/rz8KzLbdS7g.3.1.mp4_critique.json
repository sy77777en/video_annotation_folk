    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot from an eye-level perspective. Initially, a silver minivan occupies the foreground on the bottom left. Further into the scene on the left, in the middle ground, are a black car and then a white kei truck. Adjacent to these vehicles, a house with reddish-brown siding is in the left middle ground, bordered by a wooden slat fence that extends towards the center of the frame. Behind this fence, a prominent green tree stands in the center middle ground. The paved street begins in the foreground and stretches into the background, occupying the center. On the right side, a light blue house is visible in the middle ground to background, with power lines running along the street in the right middle ground and extending upwards. Distant communications towers are visible in the background, center-right, against the top sky. As the camera moves forward along the street, the vehicles, the adjacent house, the fence, and the tree on the left progressively shift towards the left edge of the frame and eventually move out of view. The street remains central, revealing more of its length ahead, while the light blue house on the right becomes more defined in the right middle ground. The power lines maintain their relative position on the right, and the distant towers remain in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a streetscape scenery shot of a quiet residential road in Japan on a sunny day. The camera moves forward along the paved street, which is lined with traditional and modern Japanese houses, some with wooden fences, small gardens and trees. Parked vehicles, including a silver minivan and a white kei truck, are visible in driveways. The focus is on the overall environment and atmosphere of the neighborhood, rather than a specific object or person, highlighting the typical suburban setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves along a narrow, paved residential street in a Japanese neighborhood on a sunny day. On the left, a small parking area next to a house with a dark tiled roof and reddish-brown siding contains, from nearest to farthest from the camera, a silver minivan, a black car, and a white kei truck. The parking area is beside a wooden slat fence that borders a property with a prominent green tree. Traditional-style houses with tiled roofs line the street. Further down the road, a light blue house is visible on the right. Power lines and poles run alongside the street, and in the distance, other houses and two red and white communications towers can be seen against a clear blue sky. Shadows are cast on the pavement, indicating the bright sunlight.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
