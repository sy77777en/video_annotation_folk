    "pre_caption": "The video opens from a first-person viewpoint, positioning a black assault rifle in the bottom center foreground. A building with an external staircase occupies the left side, stretching from the foreground to the middle ground, where a small enemy figure stands at the top of the stairs in the center. A dark green military vehicle is situated in the center-right middle ground, adjacent to stacked crates. Game interface elements, such as a minimap in the bottom left and health/ammo displays in the bottom right, are fixed in the foreground, while objective markers are distributed across the middle ground. The camera then pulls back and shifts slightly right, transitioning the view into an enclosed space filled with wooden scaffolding that occupies the foreground and middle ground. Light filters through openings in this structure from the background. The rifle remains in the bottom center foreground, now angled slightly upward, as the positions of the objective markers in the middle ground update. Throughout the sequence, the camera maintains an eye-level perspective of the unseen player.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video displays a first-person perspective of a black assault rifle, equipped with a red dot sight, held by an unseen player. In the environment, a large, dark green, boxy military vehicle, resembling a tank or armored personnel carrier, is present. Figures in dark, indistinct clothing, representing enemy soldiers, are visible at various distances, sometimes partially obscured by structures. Overlaying the view are game interface elements: a blue minimap with white and blue icons in the lower left corner, blue and white numerical displays for health and ammunition in the lower right corner, and orange and blue diamond-shaped objective markers indicating locations or targets.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes holding a dark gray firearm, shows an outdoor, urban setting during the daytime. The view encompasses light-colored concrete or stucco buildings, one of which has an external gray staircase with black railings. A dark green armored vehicle is visible in the distance, positioned near crates on the dusty ground. The perspective then moves backward, passing under plants that are visible in the scene. A heads-up display is overlaid on the view, featuring a mini-map with icons and text in the bottom left, ammunition and status bars in the bottom right, and objective markers in the upper central area.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
