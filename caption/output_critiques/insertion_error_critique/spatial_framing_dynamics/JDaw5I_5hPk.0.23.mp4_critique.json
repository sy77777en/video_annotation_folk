    "pre_caption": "This is a close-up scenery shot of a waterfall. Initially, the cascading water occupies the center of the frame in the middle ground. A dark rock face is visible in the background and on the left, while a patch of green foliage is positioned in the middle ground on the right. The camera, positioned at a level height with the waterfall, tilts downward. As it moves, the background becomes darker, and the foliage on the right shifts toward the top of the frame, bringing the splashing water droplets in the center into sharper focus.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a nature scenery shot presenting a close-up, dynamic view of a waterfall. Water cascades forcefully down a light-colored rock face, accentuated by dark veining that adds depth and texture to the scene. The water splashes into a brilliant white spray and countless individual droplets that stand out against the shadowy background. To the right, a patch of lush, bright green foliage adds a vibrant contrast to the scene. As the camera tilts downward, the background becomes darker, highlighting the countless individual droplets at the center of the frame. The focus is entirely on the powerful, natural action of the falling water and the immersive atmosphere it creates.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an outdoor, daytime setting, water cascades down a light-colored rock face with distinct dark veining. The falling water creates white splashes and frothy patterns against the textured surface. On the right side of the scene, patches of bright green foliage grow on the rocks, adding a touch of color. As the camera tilts down, the background turns dark, highlighting the countless individual droplets at the center of the frame, emphasizing the continuous downward motion of the water.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the scenery.",
