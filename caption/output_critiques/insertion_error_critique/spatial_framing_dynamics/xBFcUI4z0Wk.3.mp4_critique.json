    "pre_caption": "This full shot, filmed from a high angle, shows a race car positioned diagonally in the middle ground. The car's rear is in the bottom left, and its front is in the middle right, straddling the asphalt track on the left and a grassy incline on the right. The race car remains stationary throughout the video, with smoke continuously rising from its hood in the middle right. A white vehicle enters the frame from the bottom left foreground, travels past the race car, and exits at the top left.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A blue and yellow number 2 Chevrolet Camaro race car is stopped on a wet surface, positioned partially on an asphalt track with two yellow lines and partially on a grassy incline. The rear half of the car is yellow with \"GimmeCountry.com\" in large white letters, while the front half is blue with a \"Gimme Country\" logo on the hood. A large white racing number \"2\" is on the side door, accompanied by sponsors like \"Pinnacle\" and \"ALSCO.\" White smoke continuously billows from the hood of the car, obscuring parts of it. A white vehicle, likely a safety car with its lightbar activated, briefly appears on the left side of the scene as it drives past.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high-angle perspective, a black and yellow race car with the number 2 is stopped on a racetrack. The car is positioned at the edge of the dark asphalt, next to a sloped green grass area, with its front end angled towards the grass. Two solid yellow lines mark the boundary of the track, and the surface appears dry except for what seems to be oil around the stationary car. White steam billows from the front of the car, and the back right tire occasionally spins. A white vehicle briefly drives past in the foreground.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
