    "pre_caption": "This wide shot of an architectural scene focuses on the environment rather than a specific subject. From a low-angle perspective positioned at the surface of the water, dark, rippling water fills the entire foreground and bottom of the frame. The water extends into the middle ground, where a dark, rounded object is partially submerged left of center. The scene is flanked by an off-white tiled wall on the left and another wall on the right, while a curved ceiling with two rows of square lights occupies the top of the frame. In the background, centered at the far end of the hall, a raised circular platform stands before a tall, brightly lit doorway.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This architectural scenery shot captures a surreal, flooded interior, creating a liminal and unsettling atmosphere. A long, white hall with a curved ceiling is illuminated by rows of square lights, casting a greenish, hazy glow over the dark, murky water that fills the space. The camera is positioned at water level, emphasizing the ripples and reflections as the view extends towards a raised platform and a tall doorway in the distance. There is no main subject in this video, as the focus is intentionally placed on the strange and expansive environment. The scale of the architecture and the mysterious quality of the water are used to evoke a specific mood rather than to draw attention to any single object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a level-angle perspective, the scene unfolds within a long, partially flooded hall. The sterile, off-white walls, one of which is tiled in a grid pattern, rise towards a curved ceiling fitted with two rows of square, recessed lights. These lights cast a greenish glow over the murky water, which occupies the lower half of the frame, extending from the foreground to the background. At the far end of the expansive room, a raised circular platform stands before a tall, narrow, brightly lit doorway. A dark, rounded object, resembling a hole in the wall, is partially submerged in the water in the middle distance.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
