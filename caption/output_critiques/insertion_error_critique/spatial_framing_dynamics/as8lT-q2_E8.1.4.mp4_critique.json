    "pre_caption": "In a full shot viewed through three vertical panels, the camera is initially positioned below the subject. A woman stands in the center-left of the middle ground, with a pale-skinned figure to her left and a glowing decorative element to her right, both also in the middle ground. A layer of white material covers the foreground at the bottom of the frame. The woman falls forward, moving from the middle ground toward the foreground as she breaks through a glass pane. As she tumbles into the center of the frame, the camera's perspective shifts to become level with her, and she lands on the white material in the foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a brightly lit, chaotic scene, a woman with long, curly brown hair is falling forward through a pane of shattering glass. She wears a light-colored outfit, dark boots, and has red stains on her hands. In the middle ground, a figure with very pale skin, resembling a mannequin or decorative object, is visible, wearing a reddish-orange top. To the right, a decorative element of the room is wrapped in spiraling, glowing blue bands over an orange surface.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a vibrant, futuristic environment, viewed through three vertical panels. The background is a blur of bright, colorful neon lights in shades of red, green, and blue, suggesting a bustling city at night. In the foreground, a layer of white, snow-like material covers the ground. The central action involves a transparent barrier shattering, sending shards of glass and a flurry of white particles into the air. A figure is seen falling forward through the breaking barrier, while glowing blue bands, part of the room's decor, are visible to the right.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned below the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",
