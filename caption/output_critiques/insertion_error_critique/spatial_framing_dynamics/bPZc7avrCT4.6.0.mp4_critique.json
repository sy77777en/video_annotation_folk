    "pre_caption": "This video presents a close-up scenery shot focused on a dynamic event. A brown tree stump occupies the bottom-center foreground. A green object on the stump explodes, sending a large spray of water that originates from the bottom center and expands to fill the middle of the frame, with the main splash moving toward the top right. In the blurred background, a pile of cut logs is visible on the left, while green foliage occupies the upper and right portions of the scene. The camera is positioned at a height level with the tree stump, capturing the action head-on.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a dynamic outdoor scenery shot. The central visual event is a green object, likely a water balloon, exploding on a rough, brown tree stump, sending a dramatic spray of clear water outwards and upwards. The water droplets catch the light, creating a sparkling, energetic effect. The background is softly blurred, revealing a pile of cut logs and indistinct green foliage, suggesting a natural, possibly wooded or garden, environment. There is no single main subject in the traditional sense; instead, the focus is on the transient, forceful action of the water bursting and interacting with the natural elements, creating an atmosphere of sudden, chaotic energy within a rustic outdoor setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a brightly lit outdoor setting, a green balloon rests on a brown tree stump. As the balloon bursts, it creates a dramatic, slow-motion splash. Water droplets are suspended in the air, creating a large spray that envelops the stump. In the blurred background, a pile of cut logs and green foliage are visible.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the scenery.",
