    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a man standing in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. In the bottom-left foreground, a speaker is visible, with a computer monitor positioned behind it in the middle ground. To the man's right, another speaker and a microphone stand are located in the middle ground. The shot then transitions to a medium close-up as the man moves closer to the camera, remaining in the center of the frame. In this closer view, he turns from a slight profile to face the camera directly, gesturing with his hands. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man with a medium build wearing a stylish bandana and a jacket over a shirt with a visible graphic or text. In one part of the video, he is standing and facing sideways, while in another, he faces forward, gesturing with his hand near his head. The setting appears to be dimly lit with a greenish tint, suggesting the use of night vision or low-light conditions.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place indoors, likely in a dimly lit room with a night vision effect, giving everything a green tint. The setting includes electronic equipment, such as speakers and a monitor, suggesting a studio or control room environment. The walls are dark, and the lighting is minimal, creating a shadowy atmosphere. A person is present, moving within the space, smoking. The overall scene is characterized by its low-light conditions and the presence of technology, with the person adding a dynamic element to the otherwise static environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
