    "pre_caption": "A medium shot shows a silver statue of a man positioned in the center-right of the frame and in the middle ground. The statue holds a model train in the foreground, which extends horizontally from the center-left to the center of the frame. The train is in sharp focus, creating a sense of depth against the slightly blurred statue behind it. A text overlay is visible in the bottom-left corner. The entire scene is set against a solid black background, and the camera remains static at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A silver, metallic statue of a man resembling Adolf Hitler is depicted from the chest up against a black background. The figure wears a military-style uniform with a visible Iron Cross on the left side of its chest. In its right hand, the statue holds a model train horizontally. The train consists of two distinct cars: a shorter, red and silver engine car on the left, and a longer, grey passenger car on the right. The grey car is detailed with two rows of small, square windows and a small eagle insignia on its side. The model train is in sharp focus, while the statue holding it is slightly blurred.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Against a solid black background, a silver-colored bust of a man in a military-style uniform is shown holding a model train. The train, held horizontally, consists of a red and white front car and a longer, gray passenger car with numerous small windows. The scene is lit to highlight the metallic texture of the bust and the details of the train. An overlay in the bottom-left corner initially displays \"[4];\" followed by five foreign characters, and then it shows \"(CC-BY 4.0)\".**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
