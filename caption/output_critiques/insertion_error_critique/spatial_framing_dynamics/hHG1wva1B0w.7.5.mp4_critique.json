    "pre_caption": "In a static medium shot, a red figure sits at a table in the middle ground, positioned in the center-right of the frame. The table occupies the center of the frame, also in the middle ground. On the left side of the table is a stack of books, with a cup to its right and scattered papers further to the right. In the background, a large bookshelf is on the right, a window is on the left, and a smaller bookshelf is on the far left. The camera remains stationary, positioned slightly above the subject's eye level. Text appears at the bottom of the frame, with \"June 7th, 1977\" in the bottom left and \"Pitkin County Courthouse, Aspen, Co\" in the bottom right, before both fade out.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a red, human-like figure sitting at a table in a library setting. The figure is positioned on a chair, generally facing towards the left side of the screen. The table in front of the figure holds several items, including a stack of books, a small round object, and scattered papers. The background includes bookshelves filled with books and a window with a patterned design. The figure's posture remains consistent, suggesting a focused or contemplative state. The setting and objects suggest an environment conducive to study or work.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors in a room resembling a library or study, with dark wood bookshelves filled with books lining the back wall. A large translucent window is on the left, with a small bookshelf filled with books on its left. The wall behind the window and the small bookshelf is dark gray. The floor is tiled in an alternating dark gray and light gray pattern. In the center of the room, a red, slightly reflective figure sits in a gray chair at a light-colored wooden table. On the table are a stack of books, a small white cup, and several scattered papers. Text overlays are present at the bottom of the screen, with \"June 7th, 1977\" on the left gradually appearing from left to right, and \"Pitkin County Courthouse, Aspen, Colorado\" on the right gradually appearing all at once. After a few seconds, all text fades out simultaneously.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",
