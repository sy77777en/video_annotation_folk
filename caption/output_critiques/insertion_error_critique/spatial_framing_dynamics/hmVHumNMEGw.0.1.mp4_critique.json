    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a man positioned in the center of the frame, standing on a paved walkway in the foreground. He is framed by two concrete pillars and a gate in the middle ground, with modern buildings visible in the background. As the man dances, the camera arcs from right to left around him. This movement keeps the man as the central subject while the background elements shift, and the sun, moving behind him, creates a strong backlight and a prominent lens flare that sweeps across the screen. The perspective on the man transitions from a frontal view to a profile and then a partial back view as he turns with the camera's motion.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A Black man with a shaved head is shown dancing outdoors. He is wearing a long-sleeved sweater with a black and white checkerboard pattern, which features a black collar, cuffs, and waistband. He is also wearing blue jeans, black boots, and has a chain hanging from the side of his pants.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene unfolds during the day in a modern urban residential area. In the background, contemporary apartment buildings with glass-paneled facades stand behind a black metal fence and manicured green hedges. The middle ground features a light-colored paved walkway with a gated entrance flanked by two concrete pillars, each with a sign affixed to it. The scene is brightly illuminated by the sun, which creates a prominent lens flare and casts long, distinct shadows across the pavement. A person in a black-and-white checkered sweater and blue jeans dances in front of the gate as the camera moves around them.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
