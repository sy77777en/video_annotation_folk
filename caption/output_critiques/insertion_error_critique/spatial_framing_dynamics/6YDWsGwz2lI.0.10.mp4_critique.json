    "pre_caption": "This wide shot of the cityscape initially frames an older, light-colored building on the left and a modern, reflective glass building on the right, both in the middle ground, flanking a narrow street that runs down the center-bottom of the frame into the background where another multi-story building is visible. A faint reflection of an interior scene is present across the entire frame in the foreground. The camera, positioned at a high vantage point looking down the street, slowly pans to the right. This movement causes the older building on the left to gradually occupy less of the left side of the frame, while more of the modern building on the right is revealed and fills more of the right side. The street and the distant building, while maintaining their central perspective, shift towards the left of the frame as the camera continues its rightward pan.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a cityscape scenery shot, looking straight at a narrow, empty street flanked by towering buildings. On the left, an older, light-colored building with classical architectural details and numerous windows stretches into the distance. On the right, a modern structure with a reflective glass and steel facade dominates the view. There is no main subject; instead, the focus is on the urban environment, the contrasting architectural styles, the imposing scale of the buildings, and the atmosphere of a quiet city canyon.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents an objective view looking straight at a narrow city street flanked by tall buildings. On the left, an older, light-colored stone or concrete building with classical architectural details, including repeating window patterns and decorative elements, lines the street. On the right, a modern building with a glass and metal facade reflects the surroundings. The street below is paved and appears empty, with a few streetlights and planters visible along its length. In the distance, at the end of the street, another multi-story building with numerous windows is visible. The overall lighting suggests an overcast day, casting a muted, somewhat desaturated tone over the scene. The camera slowly moves right, revealing more of the modern building. In the foreground of the frame, there is a reflection that appears to show an interior scene, where a door, a window, and several rows of lights can be faintly seen. This suggests it might be the interior of a train moving from left to right.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
