    "pre_caption": "In a static medium close-up shot, a man occupies the left side of the frame, while a woman is on the right, both positioned in the foreground. They are turned towards each other, with the man in near-profile and the woman in a three-quarter view. The background is indistinct and out of focus. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level, maintaining a fixed frame throughout the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a black-and-white close-up, a man and a woman stand close together, facing each other in profile. The man on the left is middle-aged and light-skinned, with short, dark hair. He is wearing a dark suit jacket over a light-colored collared shirt and a dark tie. The woman on the right is a young adult with light skin and dark, shoulder-length hair styled in soft waves. She is dressed in a dark, high-collared garment and is looking up at the man.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This monochromatic scene is set within a dimly lit indoor environment. A man in a dark suit and tie is positioned on the left, facing a woman on the right. They are shown in a close-up, looking intently at one another. The background is dark and out of focus, and the scene is characterized by low-key lighting that casts deep shadows while illuminating the subjects' faces.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
