    "pre_caption": "This video presents a static, wide shot of a city street, captured from an eye-level perspective. The focus is on the overall scenery rather than a specific subject. The composition is framed with a tall, black wrought-iron fence and trees in the left foreground and middle ground, while a wet stone sidewalk extends from the bottom left into the center background. The right side of the frame is occupied by parked vehicles, including two large trucks, in the middle ground. Behind them, a row of colorful buildings lines the street in the right middle ground and background, with a skyscraper visible in the distant center background. Although the shot is static, a few pedestrians are seen in the left middle ground, walking away from the camera along the sidewalk.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a moody cityscape scenery shot of a street in New Orleans on an overcast day. The perspective is from a wide, wet stone sidewalk bordered on the left by a tall, black wrought-iron fence and lush trees, including a palm tree. On the right, the street is lined with parked vehicles, most notably a large white Penske rental truck, and features a row of classic, colorful buildings with ornate balconies. The shot lacks a single main subject, as the focus is deliberately placed on the overall environment to capture the city's distinct atmosphere and architectural charm. The few pedestrians walking along the sidewalk serve only to add a sense of scale and life to the scene rather than acting as a focal point.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A view down a city street on an overcast day shows a wet, grey stone sidewalk on the left, bordered by a tall, black wrought-iron fence. Behind the fence, a palm tree and other leafy trees are visible. The street on the right is lined with parked vehicles, including a prominent white Penske rental truck and another box truck. Colorful two and three-story buildings with balconies line the opposite side of the street. In the distant background, a modern skyscraper is partially obscured by fog. A few pedestrians walk along the damp sidewalk.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
