    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a full shot from an upside-down, worm's-eye perspective, with the camera positioned below the subjects. In this initial framing, the soles of a child's boots are in the center foreground, with their body extending toward the top of the frame. An adult in a white shirt is positioned in the left middle ground, and another adult in a red shirt is in the right middle ground, both supporting the child. A large, dark object occupies the left foreground, and a framed picture is visible in the top right background. The entire scene then rotates as the camera moves upward, transitioning from a view below the subject to one at the subject's level. This movement shifts the perspective to a low-angle, hip-level view, where the child is now upright in the center of the frame, flanked by the two adults, while the initial foreground and background elements are no longer in the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video centers on a young child with medium skin, curly brown hair, and wearing a green shirt, light-colored shorts, red socks, and brown boots, who is being lifted or supported by two adults. One adult, positioned on the left, wears a white shirt and is seen holding the child by the waist, while the other adult, on the right, wears a bright red long-sleeve shirt and assists in supporting the child’s back. The child is oriented upright and appears to be the main focus, with the adults’ actions directed toward helping or positioning the child. The adults’ faces are not fully visible, but their clothing and physical interaction with the child are clear, indicating a collaborative effort centered on the child.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an indoor scene with a frequently changing perspective. It starts with a ground-level, upside-down worm's eye view and transitions to a low-angle, hip-level perspective. The ceiling is light green, and the walls are white and textured. Initially, the soles of the shoes of the person being held are facing the camera, with no other shoes visible. In the first part of the video, framed pictures are visible on the wall in the upper right, and a large, dark, round object, possibly the bottom of a desk, is partially visible in the left foreground. These elements move out of the frame as the camera shifts. The footage has a vintage film quality with a greenish tint, deep focus, and low resolution. Black letterbox bars are on the left and right sides, and a dark vignette frames the entire view.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned below the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",
