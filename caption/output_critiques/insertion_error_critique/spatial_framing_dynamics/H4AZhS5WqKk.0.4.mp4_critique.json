    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot showing the upper body of a gray-blue cat in the foreground on the left. A small green ball is briefly visible in the middle ground on the right before it falls out of the frame. Subsequently, a small, red cat materializes in the middle ground on the right, with his full body visible, positioned slightly higher than the gray-blue cat's head. A white cloud simultaneously appears beneath the red cat's feet. The gray-blue cat remains stationary in the left foreground. The background consists of a brick wall and a vertical pipe in the middle ground on the left, and out-of-focus lights in the distant background on the right. The camera is positioned at the level of the gray-blue cat.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A gray-blue cartoon cat with a white muzzle, a light gray chest patch, and pink inner ears is shown from the upper body up. Initially, he has an angry expression and holds a small green ball in his white left hand. The ball then disappears from view as a small, red cartoon cat, depicted as a devil with horns and a pointed tail, appears. This red cat, who has a white muzzle, stands on a small white cloud and holds a red trident. The gray-blue cat's expression shifts to one of surprise and concern as he looks at the smaller, red cat. The red cat is shown in his entirety, gesturing towards the larger cat.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dark, wet alley at night, characterized by a brick wall reflecting light and a large, black vertical pipe. In the background, an out-of-focus grated iron gate reveals numerous scattered white lights. A large, blue-gray animated cat is positioned in the alley, holding a single green olive that drops out of the scene at the beginning. A small, red, devil-like animated cat, holding a red trident, materializes and stands on a floating white cloud that appears beneath it. Throughout the scene, light rain falls.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a gray-blue cartoon cat holding a green ball in his left hand, with his upper body visible. Then, the green ball is out of the frame, and a red cartoon cat shows up on the left side, depicted as a devil, appearing on a cloud and revealing his entire body.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
