    "pre_caption": "A full shot captures a large, kinetic light sculpture positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground. The sculpture's stand rests on a board at the bottom center, with wires and a control box in the foreground at the bottom left. In the background, workshop equipment is visible on the left. The camera remains static and is positioned at the subject's level, maintaining a consistent view as the sculpture's multi-colored, cup-shaped lights rotate on their rods, creating a dynamic, layered pattern of spinning concentric circles.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases a large, kinetic light sculpture with a three-dimensional, circular form. The sculpture is constructed from a single silver-colored metal ring. Along the edge of this ring are curved rods that support cup-shaped lights in shades of blue, yellow, green, and red. These rods rotate around their attachment points on the ring, creating a dynamic, moving sculpture. The entire apparatus is mounted on a dark, three-legged stand, which rests on a light-colored rectangular board on the floor. Several black and white wires are visible on the floor, connecting to a small black box that appears to be a power supply or controller.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor workshop with a green-blue floor, a large, circular kinetic sculpture is in motion. The sculpture, mounted on a black stand, features a single, simple ring with multiple curved rods supporting cup-shaped lights. As these rods rotate, they create the illusion of concentric layers of colored lights moving inward. The lights, in blue, green, yellow, and red, illuminate the spinning components and cast a vibrant glow on the surroundings. Wires run from the base of the stand to a control box on the floor, and in the background, workshop items like a white bucket and coiled cables are visible.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
