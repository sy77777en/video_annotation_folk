    "pre_caption": "This is a static medium close-up shot featuring two men from the chest up. The man on the left is positioned in the foreground, occupying the left side of the frame. To his right and slightly further back in the middle ground sits a second man. They are at a table in the foreground, with the man on the right holding a mug in the middle ground. The background consists of out-of-focus red and teal lights across the top of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subjects' eye level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Two men in matching yellow, long-sleeved collared shirts are depicted sitting side-by-side. The man on the left, who has blondish-green hair in a bowl cut, leans forward with his head bowed. He presses his left hand to his forehead, covering his eyes, while his right hand holds a purple object resembling his glasses. To his right sits another man with dark, neatly combed hair and glasses. This man holds a white mug in his right hand and covers his mouth and nose with his left hand as he looks down.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This illustrated indoor scene is set at night, characterized by a dark, out-of-focus background with glowing red and teal lights. In the foreground, two men in yellow collared shirts are seated at a table. The man on the left has light-colored hair and leans forward, resting his head in one hand while holding a purple object in the other. To his right, a man with dark hair and glasses holds a white mug while covering his mouth with his hand. The scene is illuminated by a cool, teal-colored light from the right, casting highlights on the subjects and creating a warm, ambient glow.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.",
