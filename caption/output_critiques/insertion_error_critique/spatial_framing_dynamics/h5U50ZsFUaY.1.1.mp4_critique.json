    "pre_caption": "In an extreme wide shot, a person with a parachute is initially positioned in the center-left middle ground, with a large, reddish-brown rock pillar dominating the right side of the frame. The camera, starting from a position below the subject, rotates clockwise around the pillar while simultaneously ascending and tilting downward. As the camera moves, the subject descends, circling from the left side of the pillar toward the right. The shot transitions to a high-angle perspective, with the camera now positioned above the subject, who moves toward the center of the frame as they glide deeper into the canyon below.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person wearing a blue-and-white wingsuit flies beneath a white parachute canopy with yellow-green accents. He circles halfway down around a large rock pillar from a high altitude and then glides further away toward a lower area.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a dynamic flight through a vast, sunlit canyon dominated by towering, reddish-brown rock spires and formations with a rough, layered texture. The drone's perspective initially rotates clockwise around a central point above the massive rock structures, then ascends while tilting downward to track a person with a predominantly white parachute featuring yellow-green accents. The individual descends along the rock face, circling halfway around the pointed summit of a large rock pillar before proceeding toward a lower section of the distant canyon. The scene unfolds under a bright blue sky filled with wispy white clouds, highlighting the dramatic, arid landscape.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned below the subject. It then changes to above the subject.",
