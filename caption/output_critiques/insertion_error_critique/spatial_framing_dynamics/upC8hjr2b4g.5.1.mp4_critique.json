    "pre_caption": "This medium shot frames a low-polygon figure, illuminated in red, in the foreground, positioned slightly left of center, seated at a desk and appearing to type on a computer. In the middle ground to the right, a second low-polygon figure stands with arms crossed. Further to the right and in the background, a third partially obscured low-polygon figure is visible. All subjects remain static throughout the shot, and the camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features three stylized, low-polygon human figures in a dimly lit setting. In the foreground, a figure with a form and short, wreath-like hairstyle suggestive of a female is seated at a desk, appearing to type on a computer. This figure is rendered in a light gray, angular style, but its head and torso are strongly illuminated by a red light, giving them a distinct red appearance, while its arms and hands also show a red tint. In the background, to the right, stand two other figures. The figure closer to the center, with a build and attire resembling a formal suit, stands with arms crossed and appears to be male. The figure further to the right is partially obscured, has a hand on their hip, and is wearing a scarf, suggesting they are female. Both background figures are a uniform light gray or white, with subtle blueish ambient lighting, and are rendered in a low-polygon, angular style. All three figures have featureless, angular faces.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts a dimly lit indoor scene featuring three low-poly, stylized human figures. In the foreground, a figure with short, stylized hair is seated at a dark desk, with both hands on the keyboard of a computer monitor that has a curved stand, seemingly typing. This central figure is rendered in a desaturated tone but is prominently illuminated by a red glow emitted from the monitor, highlighting its torso and faceless head. Behind this individual, two other figures stand in the darker background; they are rendered in a pale, almost white, desaturated color. One of these background figures has its arms crossed, and both appear to be observing the person at the computer. The overall environment is dark and minimalist, with the red light on the foreground figure being the most striking visual element.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
