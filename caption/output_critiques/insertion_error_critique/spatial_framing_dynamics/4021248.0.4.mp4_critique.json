    "pre_caption": "This medium close-up shot, filmed at the subjects' level, initially frames a man in a red jacket on the left and a man in a blue shirt on the right, both in the middle ground. A large, open delivery bag is positioned in the center foreground between them. The man on the right reaches into the bag, which is held steady by the man on the left. In the background, a refrigerator stands on the right, with a scale on a counter to its far right. The man in the red jacket then closes the bag's lid, moving it from an upright position down over the central opening, before turning and carrying the bag toward the left side of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two men interacting with a red and black insulated delivery bag. The man on the left, wearing a red jacket with black accents, is holding the bag. The man on the right, dressed in a blue shirt and beige apron, is loading pots into the bag. Their actions suggest a collaborative effort, likely involving the preparation or transfer of items within the bag.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an indoor commercial space with a white refrigerator and a metal counter holding a digital scale, a man in a beige apron places items into a large, open delivery bag. The bag, held by a man in a red and black jacket, is red with black trim and has a silver, insulated interior. The man in the jacket then closes the lid of the bag, which has a white reflective stripe on its exterior.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
