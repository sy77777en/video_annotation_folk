    "pre_caption": "This is a medium shot of a group of police officers in a dark environment. In the foreground, an officer is positioned slightly right of center, framed from the chest up as he looks upward. To his left, in the midground, another officer is shown from the chest up, looking toward the left of the frame. Other officers are positioned in the midground and background, with two individuals in tactical gear visible on the far right. Bright, unfocused lights are located in the top background. The camera remains static and is positioned at the subjects' eye level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A group of police officers stands together in a dark environment. In the foreground, in the center, a light-skinned man with short, dark hair and a police cap looks upward; his dark blue uniform has a yellow stripe over the shoulder. In the midground on the left, a light-skinned man with short, blond hair is shown from the chest up, wearing a dark blue police uniform and looking toward the left. Next to him, another light-skinned man with short, blond hair looks forward. On the far right, two individuals wear black helmets and dark tactical gear. In the background, several blurred officers are visible. The officers are illuminated by bright, focused lights.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **At night, within a dark tunnel, a group of people in dark uniforms are gathered. The scene is dimly lit, punctuated by the bright, focused beams of several flashlights they are holding, which cast a harsh light on their surroundings. Yellow lights are mounted on the walls, and additional, brighter lights are visible in the background. The uniformed individuals, some wearing helmets, are looking upwards and around the dark environment.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a group of policemen standing together. The people in the foreground are shown only from the face, those in the middle are framed from the waist up, and the people in the background are shown in full body, though some are partially occluded by others in front. \n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
