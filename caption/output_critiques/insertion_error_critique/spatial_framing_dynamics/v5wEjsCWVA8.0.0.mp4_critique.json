    "pre_caption": "A medium shot frames a snowboarder in the foreground, positioned slightly left of the center. The surrounding scene consists of a snow-covered slope that extends from the foreground into the background, with evergreen trees scattered in the middle ground on both the left and right sides of the frame. A sliver of dark blue sky is visible at the top of the frame in the background. As the snowboarder moves down the slope, the camera, held at his level, pulls away from him, transitioning the framing from a medium shot to a wider full shot. This movement also shifts the snowboarder more towards the center of the frame while he remains in the foreground, as snow he kicks up dynamically occupies the foreground and middle ground around him.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with a long, thick, light-colored beard and mustache, both completely covered in white frost and ice, is shown from a level or low-angle perspective. He wears a bright red and black hooded winter jacket over dark snow pants. On his hands are black and white gloves, which are also covered in snow. He has on large, reflective ski goggles with a multi-colored lens, and a small action camera is mounted on his head. He is skiing on dark skis and wears a gray knit hat. His backpack is entirely black.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A selfie POV shot, where the camera is held by the person being filmed and faces them, captures the dynamic motion of snowboarding down a steep, snow-covered mountain. The outdoor scene is set on a bright, sunny day under a clear, deep blue sky. Evergreen trees are scattered across the snowy landscape. As the snowboarder glides through deep powder, a burst of snow rises around him, leaving a winding trail in the snow behind.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subject’s framing (shot size) is not stable** throughout the video, so the description should emphasize this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
