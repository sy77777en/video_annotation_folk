    "pre_caption": "The video commences with a wide shot, where two motorcyclists enter from the bottom right of the frame, positioned in the middle ground, as they navigate a left curve on an asphalt track. The track itself extends from the bottom right foreground, curving towards the top left and into the middle ground. A white, elevated structure is situated in the top left, within the middle ground, on the sandy expanse. Hazy mountains are visible across the top background. As the motorcyclists proceed along the curve, moving towards the center-left of the frame and further into the middle ground, the camera pulls back, transitioning to an extreme wide shot. In this wider view, the motorcyclists appear smaller, located in the center-left middle ground, while the track and the surrounding desert landscape occupy a larger portion of the foreground and middle ground, with the mountains remaining in the distant background. The camera maintains a position above the subjects.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Two motocross riders expertly navigate a track set in a yellow sand field, showcasing their impressive skills as they drift their motorcycles at high speeds along the curves. The video emphasizes the dynamic movements and forward momentum of the riders as they maneuver through the challenging terrain.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone shows two motorcyclists navigating a sharp left turn on an asphalt racetrack, riding closely together. The track, marked with a black and yellow checkered curb, curves through a vast, sandy desert landscape under a clear, pale blue sky. In the background, hazy mountains are visible on the horizon. A small, white, elevated, open-sided structure stands on the sandy area to the left of the track. The overall scene suggests a daytime setting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to an extreme wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
