    "pre_caption": "This low-angle medium shot frames a mannequin in the left foreground and a man in the right middle ground. In the background, a ceiling made of a grid of purple-lit panels occupies the top of the frame. The man actively dances in place, moving his arms and upper body within the right side of the frame, while the mannequin on the left remains static. The camera's position is fixed throughout the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a silver-colored mannequin on the left  under purple lighting. The main subject is a man in the center, wearing a long-sleeved shirt. He has short hair and is actively moving his upper body and dancing with his arms raised above his head. The lighting casts a strong purple hue over both the mannequin and the man, creating a distinct visual effect.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a low-angle perspective, the scene is set within a dark, enclosed space. The primary source of light is a ceiling composed of a grid of square, backlit panels that emit a uniform, saturated purple glow. This illumination casts the figures within the room into silhouette as a man dances beside a mannequin beneath the glowing grid. The walls of the room are dark and not clearly visible.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
