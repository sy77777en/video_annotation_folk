    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot showing a red panda in the center of the frame, positioned on a wooden platform that is part of a climbing structure. The red panda is in the middle ground, while the climbing structure extends vertically from the bottom center to the top left of the frame. The grassy enclosure, shrubs, and trees fill the foreground and background, with a low wall and embankment running horizontally across the upper background. The camera is initially at the red panda’s height, capturing the animal as it moves along the platform and down the stairs. As the red panda descends to the ground and walks toward the left side of the frame, the camera angle shifts to an overhead view, placing the red panda in the lower left quadrant of the frame and showing more of the enclosure’s layout from above. Throughout the video, the spatial relationship between the red panda and the climbing structure is maintained, with the structure remaining central and the red panda moving from the elevated middle ground to the foreground and then across the ground, while the camera transitions from a level perspective to a higher vantage point.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a red panda with reddish-brown fur, a bushy ringed tail, and a dark face with white markings. The red panda is seen both on a wooden platform supported by a metal frame and on the grassy ground below, jumping from the wooden platform to the grassy ground. Its body is elongated and agile, with short legs and rounded ears, and it appears to be exploring or navigating the structure and the surrounding area.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place outdoors in a landscaped enclosure with green grass, patches of dirt, and various shrubs and small trees. A wooden and metal climbing structure with a staircase and platform stands prominently in the center, its steps and surfaces made of light-colored wood supported by dark metal frames. A low, light gray wall with a yellow sign featuring cartoon animals and Japanese text runs along the back of the enclosure, separating the area from a sloped, stone-paved embankment and additional greenery beyond. The weather is clear and bright, with sunlight illuminating the scene. A red panda with a bushy tail moves through the enclosure, at times climbing the structure and at other times walking across the grass. The overall environment is clean and well-maintained, with natural and constructed elements blending together. No overlays or digital elements are present in the video.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to above the subject.",
