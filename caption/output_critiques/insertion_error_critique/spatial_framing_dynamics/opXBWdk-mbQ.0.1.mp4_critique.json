    "pre_caption": "A medium shot frames three men sitting in a row at a long counter. The main subject is in the foreground on the left, eating from a container. To his right and slightly further back in the middle ground, a second man sits, and to the right of him, a third man is positioned in the background. The man in the foreground initially looks down at his food before lifting his head and turning to his right. The camera is stationary and positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Three men are sitting in a row at a long white counter, eating lunch. The man in the middle ground, who is the most in focus, is a light-skinned man in his late 20s or early 30s with short, neat brown hair. He is wearing a maroon polo shirt and is seen in profile, eating a salad from a clear plastic container with a fork. To his left, the right side of the framet, slightly out of focus, are two additional light-skinned men in their 30s. One is wearing a dark green t-shirt and is taking food out of a brown paper bag, while the other is wearing a white collared shirt. Both of these men turn their heads to look at the man in the middle ground.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a brightly lit, modern indoor setting, three men are seated in a row at a long, white counter, eating their lunch. The man in the middle ground wears a maroon polo shirt and eats a salad from a clear, rectangular plastic container with a fork. Next to him, another man in a black t-shirt reaches into a brown paper bag, while a third man in a white shirt sits further down the counter. The background is softly blurred, showing the interior of a contemporary space.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
