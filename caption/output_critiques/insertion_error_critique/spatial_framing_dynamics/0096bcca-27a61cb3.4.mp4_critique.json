    "pre_caption": "This video presents a static wide shot of a city intersection at night, with the focus on the overall scenery rather than a specific subject. The perspective is from a low angle, consistent with a vehicle's dashboard, looking straight ahead. In the foreground, the dark road and white lane markings occupy the bottom half of the frame. The middle ground contains the intersection itself, with red traffic lights visible at the top center and top left. A bright streetlight at the top center creates a large, circular lens flare. A building occupies the right side of the frame in the middle ground, with a white vehicle parked next to it on the far right. In the background, the road stretches into the center, where distant headlights are visible, and a brightly lit structure is positioned on the far left. The entire shot remains stationary.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing a dark city street at night from what appears to be the perspective of a vehicle's dashboard. The scene is illuminated by the glow of red traffic lights and a bright overhead streetlight, which creates a prominent circular lens flare against the black sky. On the left side of the scene, a luminous sign adds a vibrant touch to the urban landscape. Faintly visible are the outlines of buildings to the right and the headlights of distant cars, enhancing the urban atmosphere. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the overall environment and the quiet, atmospheric mood of a city intersection after dark, rather than on any specific person or object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A forward-facing dashcam view from a vehicle-mounted camera captures a nighttime scene at an urban intersection. The vehicle is stopped on a dark asphalt road, facing red traffic lights. A bright, white streetlight overhead creates a prominent lens flare against the dark sky. To the right, a multi-story building lines the street, while on the far left, a structure is illuminated with colorful lights. Other vehicle headlights are visible in the distance down the straight road, and a white SUV is parked in the midground on the far right.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
