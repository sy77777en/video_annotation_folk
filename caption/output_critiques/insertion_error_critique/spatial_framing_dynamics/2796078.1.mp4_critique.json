    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium close-up shot of a woman holding a small dog, positioned on the left side of the frame in the foreground. The camera is at her level, capturing her from the waist up. As she moves out of the frame towards the left, the shot transitions to a wider view of the outdoor café setting. The wooden chairs and tables occupy the middle ground, scattered across the center and right side of the frame. In the background, greenery and a building with large windows fill the upper portion of the frame. The decorative wooden panel with a geometric pattern is located in the top center, while potted plants and trees are situated in the top left and right areas. The transition from the initial medium close-up to the wider shot occurs smoothly as the woman exits the frame, revealing more of the outdoor setting. The camera remains stationary throughout, maintaining a consistent height relative to the original subject.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a woman facing to the left side of the frame, holding a small dog with curly fur. She has curly brown hair tied back with a clip and is wearing a beige jacket. As the video progresses, the woman and the dog move out of the frame, revealing an outdoor setting with wooden chairs and tables, and a backdrop of greenery and a building with large windows.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor café setting during the day, featuring wooden tables and chairs arranged on a stone patio. The environment is lush with greenery, including potted plants and trees, creating a natural and inviting atmosphere. A cluster of foliage sits behind a large window, adding depth to the scene. The café's architecture includes a decorative wooden panel with a geometric pattern. The overall ambiance is relaxed and casual, with a focus on the harmonious blend of natural elements and simple, rustic furniture.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects disappearing from the frame**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium close-up shot of the subject. Then the subject disappears.\n\nBefore the subject disappears, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
