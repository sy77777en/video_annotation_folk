    "pre_caption": "The video presents a full shot of the scene, capturing the entire large passenger airplane and the damaged hangar. The airplane, positioned centrally in the middle ground, dominates the scene with its distinctive tail design and silver-white color. The hangar, also in the middle ground, is situated slightly behind the airplane, with its collapsed roof and walls extending towards the left side of the frame. Debris from the collision is scattered across the foreground, particularly on the left side. The smoke rising from the damaged area occupies the upper left portion of the frame, adding depth to the scene. The wet tarmac, reflecting the bright lights, spans the entire bottom of the frame, enhancing the visual impact. Various airport vehicles and equipment are visible in the background, positioned towards the right side of the frame. The camera maintains a consistent overhead position throughout the video, providing a clear view of the spatial arrangement and the extent of the damage. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial position, ensuring a stable and comprehensive perspective of the event.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a large passenger airplane with a distinctive tail design, which has collided with a building. The aircraft is silver and white, with a prominent dark emblem on the tail that resembles a bird. The building, which appears to be a hangar, is partially collapsed, with debris scattered around the impact site. Smoke is rising from the damaged area, and the structure is illuminated by bright lights, highlighting the extent of the destruction. The scene is set on a wet tarmac, reflecting the lights and adding to the dramatic visual impact.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a drone POV, showcases an outdoor airport setting at night. The scene features a large aircraft that has collided with a hangar, causing significant structural damage. The hangar's roof and walls are partially collapsed, with debris scattered around. The aircraft is light-colored with a distinctive emblem on its tail. The area is illuminated by artificial lights, casting reflections on the wet tarmac, suggesting recent rain. Smoke or mist rises from the damaged hangar, adding to the dramatic atmosphere. Surrounding the scene are various airport vehicles and equipment, contributing to the industrial environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
