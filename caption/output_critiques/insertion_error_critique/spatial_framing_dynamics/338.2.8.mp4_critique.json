    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a blurry medium shot showing a woman in yellow on the left and a man in maroon on the right, both positioned in the middle ground. In the foreground, two plates of food are visible at the bottom of the frame. The camera then performs a rapid pan from left to right, creating a motion-blurred transition. The shot resolves into a stable medium shot centered on a different woman wearing a vest, who is now in the middle ground. A glass of iced tea occupies the left foreground, with a plate of food in front of her. Throughout the sequence, the camera remains at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a complex focus transition in a dining setting. Initially, the subject is a woman with medium-length dark hair, glasses, and a light brown skin tone, wearing a yellow patterned top and holding chopsticks over a plate of food. The focus then shifts to a man with glasses wearing a maroon shirt. Following this, it transitions to a woman with long dark hair and glasses, dressed in a maroon vest over a black top. Finally, the focus is on a woman with glasses, wearing a maroon vest with gold trim over a white shirt, and her name tag reads \"Susan.\" She has a light brown skin tone and is holding chopsticks in front of a plate with green vegetables. A glass of iced tea is visible on the table. The transitions between individuals occur smoothly, suggesting a deliberate shift in focus.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an indoor setting within a dimly lit restaurant, featuring a table set for a meal. The environment exudes a warm, subdued ambiance with dark wooden elements and traditional decor. Each individual at the table has a plate of noodles and vegetables, accompanied by a glass of iced tea. The scene opens with a focus on a woman dressed in a yellow outfit, highlighting the iced tea and plate of food in front of her. As the camera pans from left to right, it reveals framed paintings on the decorated walls, tables with white tablecloths, and a refined, opulent ceiling featuring a delicate chandelier. The lighting casts soft shadows, enhancing the intimate atmosphere. The individuals are engaged in dining, using chopsticks, suggesting a calm, focused dining experience, with the restaurant's decor and table setting providing a cohesive backdrop.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a medium shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",
