    "pre_caption": "This full shot, captured from above, initially shows a large marine mammal, mostly submerged, in the center-right foreground, its dark tail fluke creating white foam as it moves towards the top left and dives. As it submerges, its body becomes a dark shape moving from the center-right towards the center-left in the middle ground. Simultaneously, a second, larger dark shape, another marine mammal, is visible beneath the surface in the center-left middle ground, also moving towards the top left. The deep blue water with white splashes occupies the entire frame. A \"BBC\" logo is consistently positioned in the top left corner.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a large marine mammal, likely a whale, swimming in the ocean. The whale is mostly submerged, with its dark, smooth body partially visible above the water's surface. Surrounding the whale, the water is a deep blue, with white foam and splashes indicating movement. As the video progresses, a second whale becomes visible, appearing alongside the first whale as it continues to swim. The scene captures the dynamic interaction between the whales and the ocean, emphasizing their size and the water's motion.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A view from just above the water's surface captures a deep blue ocean during the daytime, with sunlight glinting off the rippling surface. A large, dark gray marine animal is visible moving through the water, its powerful tail fluke creating white foam and significant splashes as it propels itself and begins to dive. As the video progresses, a second whale can be seen swimming beneath the surface. In the top left corner, a \"BBC\" logo overlay is present, consisting of three white letters, each enclosed within a dark square shape.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
