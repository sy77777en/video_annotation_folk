    "pre_caption": "This is a full shot of a young man positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. A soccer ball is at the bottom center, in the middle ground near his foot. The green soccer pitch occupies the bottom of the frame in the foreground and middle ground, while a white, featureless background fills the top portion of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's height.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young man with medium, dark hair and bangs is depicted in a dynamic pose. He is wearing a red, sleeveless athletic jersey with black trim and a white number \"1\" on the chest, layered over a long-sleeved black compression shirt. He also wears red shorts over black leggings and black athletic shoes. A faint, glowing blue aura surrounds his body as he appears to be kicking a black and white soccer ball positioned near his right foot. His cyan-colored eyes are noticeable.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a stylized, animated setting, a bright green soccer pitch marked with a white line extends towards a luminous, featureless white background. An animated male figure, surrounded by a glowing blue aura, is positioned on the field. He is dressed in a red and black uniform featuring the number one. His foot is raised over a classic black-and-white paneled soccer ball.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a close-up shot.",
