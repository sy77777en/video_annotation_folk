    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide shot is captured from a high-angle, top-down perspective. Initially, a pixelated character stands on a green putting mat in the center of the frame, which serves as the middle ground. To the right, a row of golf bags is aligned vertically. In the foreground, user interface elements are positioned at the bottom of the screen: an antique putter icon is in the bottom left, a power bar is in the bottom center, and a golf ball icon is in the bottom right. As the character putts the ball, the camera pans vertically upwards, revealing the upper portion of the room. This movement repositions the character and mat to the lower half of the frame and brings an older man and shelves into view in the upper-left and top areas of the scene, respectively. The foreground UI elements remain fixed in their positions throughout the camera movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a pixel art video game scene, a character with brown hair, a green shirt, and brown pants stands on a green putting mat inside a wooden room. The setting is atypical for golf, as the right side of the room is lined with several golf bags containing clubs, some featuring red designs. An older, white-haired man with glasses, wearing a blue shirt, is also present, sitting in a chair in the upper part of the room. The game's user interface is visible, featuring an image of a golden \"Antique Putter\" in the lower-left, a yellow power bar at the bottom center, and an icon of a white golf ball with a red dot labeled \"MAT\" in the lower-right.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view shows an indoor scene with wooden plank floors and walls. In the center is a rectangular, bright green putting mat containing a white cup filled with clubs and a black hole. A pixelated character in a green shirt stands on the mat and putts a white golf ball, which travels with a blue trail. The view moves upward to reveal more of the room, including an older character in a blue shirt standing near shelves holding various items. Lined up along the right side of the room are several golf bags containing clubs, some featuring red designs. The scene includes several overlay elements: in the bottom left, an image of an \"ANTIQUE PUTTER\"; in the bottom center, a yellow power meter with \"12Y\" below it; and in the bottom right, an image of a golf ball on a mat labeled \"MAT\" and \"0Y RANGE\".**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.",
