    "pre_caption": "This is a wide, static scenery shot. The scene is framed by out-of-focus tree trunks in the foreground, with two on the left and one on the right, creating a natural window through which the rest of the landscape is viewed. In the middle ground, a single wooden post stands in the snow-covered landscape, which stretches from the foreground to the background. The central focus of the background is a large, weathered wooden barn, positioned in the center of the frame. To the right of the barn, a wooden corral is partially visible. The camera remains stationary at what appears to be eye level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a rural scenery shot depicting a weathered, wooden barn with a dark, shingled gambrel roof set against a flat, white, overcast sky. The entire landscape is blanketed in thick snow, with a smaller, attached section of the barn also topped with a layer of white. To the right of the main structure, a rustic wooden corral stands partially visible. The scene is framed by three tree trunks in the foreground. On the left, there are two trunks, one in front of the other; the farther trunk is forked and relatively clear, while the closer one is more blurred. On the right side, there is another very blurred tree. This framing and the stark, monochromatic environment create a composition focused on conveying a sense of quiet, cold desolation and the stillness of a winter's day.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A snowy, rural landscape is seen during the daytime under an overcast sky. The scene is framed by three dark, leafless tree trunks in the foreground. On the left, two trees are positioned one in front of the other; the trunk further from the camera is more distinct, while the one closer is somewhat blurred. On the right side, another tree is very blurry. In the middle ground, a wooden post stands in the snow. In the background, a large, weathered wooden barn with a dark, shingled gambrel roof and log walls stands in a field of white snow. A smaller, attached section of the barn has its roof covered in snow. Adjacent to the structure is a wooden corral, and some dry grasses poke through the snow-covered ground, which extends from the foreground all the way to the background.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
