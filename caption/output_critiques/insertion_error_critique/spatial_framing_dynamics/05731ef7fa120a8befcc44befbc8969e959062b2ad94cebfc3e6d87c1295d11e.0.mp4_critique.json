    "pre_caption": "The video captures the dynamic movement of vibrant yellow ink in a fluid medium, set against a bright, light-filled background. Initially, two distinct clusters of yellow ink appear, one on the left side and another on the right side of the frame, both in the foreground. As the video progresses, these clusters begin to expand and swirl, gradually merging towards the center. The ink's movement creates intricate, cloud-like patterns with soft, rounded edges, filling more of the frame and dominating the visual space. The yellow hues vary in intensity, adding depth and texture to the evolving shapes. By the end of the video, the ink has formed a cohesive, dense mass occupying most of the frame, with the remaining lighter areas providing contrast. The camera remains stationary throughout, capturing the fluid motion and transformation of the ink from multiple angles within the same plane. The overall spatial dynamics highlight the continuous evolution and merging of the ink, creating a visually striking and fluid composition.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a dynamic display of vibrant yellow ink swirling and expanding in a fluid medium. The ink forms intricate, cloud-like patterns with soft, rounded edges, creating a sense of movement and transformation. The shapes continuously evolve, with the yellow hues varying in intensity, giving a rich, textured appearance. The overall effect is abstract, with the ink appearing to float and merge, creating a visually striking and fluid composition.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents an abstract scene with a focus on vibrant colors and fluid motion. It begins with a bright, light-filled background that transitions into a dynamic display of swirling yellow ink. The ink forms intricate, cloud-like shapes, creating a sense of movement and transformation. The setting is undefined, emphasizing the visual spectacle of the ink's texture and flow. The overall atmosphere is bright and vivid, with the yellow ink standing out against the lighter backdrop, highlighting the contrast and fluidity of the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
