    "pre_caption": "This medium shot frames four figures in white suits within a white room. Three figures are grouped on the right side of the frame in the middle ground, observing a screen. The tallest figure, wearing a red top hat, stands slightly behind the other two on the right. A fourth figure is positioned on the left side of the frame in the middle ground, initially looking towards the group on the right before turning their head to face the screen. The screen is embedded in a console located in the center-left middle ground, with a control panel beneath it. Initially black, the screen later displays a small, white figure in its center. The camera remains static at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows four people dressed in identical white full-body suits with hoods covering their heads. At first, three of the people on the right are clustered together, looking towards a screen embedded in a white console, while the person on the far left turns their head to face them, with a look of anxiety. Then, she turned her head to look at the screen as well, before glancing at the person on the far right and saying something. The person on the far right, who is taller than the others and wears a red top hat over their white hood, looks at the screen and begins to operate something. Initially, the screen is black, but then a small, indistinct white figure, resembling a person, appears in the center of the screen.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set indoors within a stark white room. Four figures clad in white hooded suits, one distinguished by a maroon top hat worn over the hood, are gathered around a built-in monitor recessed into the wall. Beneath the screen, which initially appears black but later shows a small, indistinct white figure, is a control panel featuring several buttons. The white suits have thin orange or red piping details.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
