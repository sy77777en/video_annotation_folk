    "pre_caption": "The video uses a wide shot to capture a city street scene, with the camera positioned at approximately eye level relative to the sidewalk. In the first frame, a cyclist is visible in the bottom left foreground, moving away from the camera along the sidewalk, while a black utility box sits near the left edge in the foreground. The road occupies the center and right portions of the frame, with vehicles such as a white car, a green sedan, and a white truck traveling from left to right in the middle ground. Blue road signs and a red-and-blue no-parking sign are mounted above the street in the upper left and center background. Trees and hedges line the road, extending horizontally across the middle ground, while modern buildings and a traditional-style structure with a sloped roof are visible in the background, occupying the upper half of the frame. In the second frame, the camera remains at street level and shifts its focus to the right, centering a red taxi with a green sign in the middle ground as it moves from left to right. The sidewalk and utility box are no longer visible, and the traditional-style building becomes more prominent in the background. Throughout the video, the spatial arrangement emphasizes the depth of the urban environment, with elements distributed from the foreground (sidewalk and cyclist) to the background (buildings and sky), and the camera’s perspective remains consistent at street height.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures the landscape of a bustling city road. On the left, a person is riding a bicycle with their back to the camera, wearing a light-colored hat and a white long-sleeve top with dark pants. Numerous vehicles, predominantly white, are moving in an orderly fashion. Notable among them are a green sedan, a red taxi with a green sign, and a white truck. Additional people are visible in the distance, but their features are not clearly discernible. The scene focuses on the overall urban environment rather than specific individuals or vehicles.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, shows an outdoor urban street scene on a clear day with bright blue skies and scattered white clouds. The setting features a wide road bordered by low hedges and trees, with modern mid-rise buildings and a traditional-style structure with a sloped roof visible in the background. The sidewalk is paved with concrete tiles and includes utility covers and a black utility box. Numerous vehicles move in an orderly fashion along the street, with the majority being white. Notably, a green sedan, a red taxi featuring a green sign, and a white truck stand out among the traffic. A cyclist moves along the sidewalk. Japanese road signs with blue backgrounds and white text, as well as a red and blue no-parking sign, are mounted on poles above the street. The overall environment is clean and orderly, with green foliage providing contrast to the urban architecture.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
