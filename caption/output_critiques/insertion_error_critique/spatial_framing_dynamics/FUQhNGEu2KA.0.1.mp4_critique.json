    "pre_caption": "This medium shot is framed with a lit lamp on a nightstand in the left middle ground, while a bed occupies approximately 70% of the frame's width from the center to the right, also in the middle ground. A person, initially seen in the right foreground, moves toward the center-right and gets into the bed. As they lie down and pull a blanket over their body, their form becomes obscured under the covers in the center-right of the frame. The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level as they are bent over, and as they lie down, the fixed camera angle becomes positioned above them.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dimly lit room, a person wearing a light-colored, loose-fitting shirt gets into a bed positioned on the center-right. The bed is made with light green sheets and a matching pillow. The person pulls a patterned, dark green blanket over their body, obscuring themselves from view. To the left, a lit lamp with a white, trapezoidal shade and a bronze-colored, curved base sits on a dark nightstand with a greenish-blue top, casting a focused pool of light onto the wall behind it. A small, dark, cylindrical object is visible to the right of the lamp on the nightstand.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark bedroom at night, the only source of light is a lamp with a bronze-colored base and a white, trapezoidal shade, which sits on a dark nightstand featuring a greenish-blue top. Next to the lamp is a small, black, cylindrical object. The lamp illuminates a bed with a light green sheet and a pillow. A person wearing light-colored clothing gets into the bed and pulls a patterned blanket over themselves, leaving the rest of the room in deep shadow.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a person getting into bed and covering themselves with a blanket in a bedroom setting. On the left side of the frame, there is a prominent lamp, while the bed occupies 70% of the frame's width on the right. After getting into bed and pulling the blanket over themselves, most of the person's body is obscured under the blanket.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level and then changes to above the subject.",
