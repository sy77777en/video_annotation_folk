    "pre_caption": "The video is filmed in a first-person POV, capturing three people walking through an ancient site. The person on the left is fully visible, positioned in the bottom left of the frame, and is in the foreground. The person in the center is shown from the upper body, located in the center of the frame, also in the foreground. The person on the right is visible from above the knees, positioned in the bottom right, and is in the foreground. The stone staircase and tunnel are prominent, with textured stone walls and ceiling in the middle ground and background. The camera is at the subjects' height, maintaining a consistent level as they descend the staircase. The framing emphasizes the movement downwards into the stone passageway, with the ancient architecture providing context in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video, filmed in first-person POV, follows three people walking through an ancient site. On the left, a person is fully visible, wearing a bright orange shirt, black pants, and a blue backpack, with short dark hair. In the center, a person is shown from the upper body, wearing a striped shirt, a white hat, and a red backpack. On the right, a person is visible from above the knees, wearing a blue jacket with a white and dark blue pattern, and has short hair. The individuals are descending a stone staircase, with the person on the left leading the way. The focus is on their movement and attire, with the ancient stone surroundings providing context.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, descending into a stone tunnel. The setting is outdoors, featuring a narrow passageway with textured stone walls and ceiling, suggesting an ancient or historical structure. The stone surfaces are rough and uneven, with a sandy beige color. The time of day appears to be bright, likely midday, as natural light illuminates the scene. The environment is dry, with no visible vegetation or water. The passageway leads downward, creating a sense of movement as the viewer progresses deeper into the tunnel. The overall atmosphere is one of exploration, with the stone architecture being the most prominent visual element.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This video is filmed in first person POV and follows three people walking in an ancient site. The person on the left is fully visible, the one in the center is shown the upper body, and the person on the right is visible from above the knees. The person takes up only half the height of the frame, leaving more content for the surroundings.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
