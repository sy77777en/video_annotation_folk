    "pre_caption": "This scenery shot begins with a wide, low-angle view of historic buildings filling the frame. A detailed white marble facade is positioned in the middle ground, stretching across the lower and central parts of the scene. In the background, several large domes occupy the top left and center, while another dome encased in scaffolding is visible on the top right. The shot then slowly zooms in, transitioning to a medium shot that centers on the ornate pinnacles and statues atop the middle section of the facade.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This cityscape scenery shot captures the architectural grandeur of a historic European building, with numerous pedestrians and tourists visible on the road at the bottom of the frame. The focus is on the impressive scale and intricate details of the environment itself. The building, set against a cloudless, deep blue sky, features multiple weathered grey domes and elaborate white marble facades adorned with gothic arches, pinnacles, and numerous statues. One of the domes is conspicuously encased in scaffolding, indicating ongoing restoration work, while the view slowly zooms in to highlight the detailed stonework and statuary crowning the central section.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor, daytime view captures the intricate architecture of historic buildings in Venice against a clear, deep blue sky. The scene focuses on the upper portions of the structures, revealing a white marble facade adorned with Gothic spires, arches, and numerous statues. Several large, ribbed domes topped with crosses rise behind the facade, with one dome completely encased in metal scaffolding, contrasting with the adjacent ornate stonework and a section of warm-toned brick wall with a round window. Below, groups of pedestrians and tourists move continuously across the square, their motion resembling the accelerated rhythm of a time-lapse. The bright sunlight casts distinct shadows, highlighting the detailed carvings and textures of the buildings.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
