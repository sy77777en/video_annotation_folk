    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot, positioning the main football player in a yellow jersey in the left foreground as he runs toward the right side of the frame. In the center foreground, two other players are tangled on the ground, with more players scattered across the middle ground and a large crowd filling the background. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, tracks the main player's run, smoothly transitioning into a full shot. This change in framing brings the main player to the center-left of the frame, while another opposing player is now seen on the ground in the foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject of the video is a football player, a man with a dark skin tone, running across a green field while holding a brown football. He wears a yellow jersey with black shoulders and the white number \"86\" on the front, along with black pants that have a white stripe down the side and a black helmet. On the ground, another player in a similar yellow and black uniform is tangled with an opposing player in a light blue and white uniform. Other players from both teams are visible in the background, also running on the field. A large crowd of spectators, many wearing yellow, can be seen in the stands.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor football stadium is filled with a large crowd of spectators, many of whom are wearing yellow, creating a dense, colorful backdrop in the stands. On the green grass field, marked with white yard lines, a football game is in progress. A player in a yellow and black uniform with the number 86 on his jersey runs with the ball. An opposing player in a light blue and white uniform is nearby. The point of view is slightly shaky, suggesting that a camera operator might be running on the field. Other players from both teams are scattered across the field in various states of motion.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
