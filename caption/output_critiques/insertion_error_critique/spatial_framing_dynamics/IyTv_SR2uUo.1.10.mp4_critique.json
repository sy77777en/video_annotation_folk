    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective, the top of a wingsuit and helmet are fixed in the immediate foreground at the top center of the frame. Initially, a large rock formation with a central arch is positioned in the center of the frame in the middle ground, with a vast mountain range and a deep valley visible in the background. The camera moves rapidly forward, causing the rock arch to grow in size until the flyer passes directly through it, with the rock walls briefly occupying the left and right sides of the frame in the immediate foreground. After clearing the arch, the view opens up again to the valley and mountains in the middle ground and background, while the wingsuit and helmet remain fixed at the top center of the frame. The camera is positioned from the subject's point of view, looking forward and down into the valley.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person is seen wearing a purple wingsuit with black accents and two zippers running down the chest. The top of their black helmet is visible at the top center of the view. The camera is locked onto the body as the person flies directly towards and then through a large, jagged, light-brown rock formation with a distinct natural arch in its center.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a locked-on POV shot where the camera is mounted to an object, keeping its perspective fixed, the scene captures a rapid descent through a high-altitude mountain range. The flight path moves directly toward and through a narrow gap in a prominent, weathered rock arch. The surrounding landscape features steep, jagged mountains with a mix of grey rock faces and green, grassy slopes. In the distance, snow-capped peaks are visible under a bright blue sky with scattered white clouds. Far below, a deep, verdant valley can be seen. The purple fabric of a wingsuit and a black helmet are visible at the top of the view, framing the fast-moving scenery.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
