    "pre_caption": "In a split composition, the right half of the frame is filled by a close-up of a car in the foreground, while the left half presents a wide shot of the scenery. The car's front passenger wheel spins rapidly in the center-right foreground, with the vehicle's body extending to the top and right edges of the frame. On the left, a flat, dark ground surface occupies the foreground and middle ground, receding toward a distant mountain range in the background at the horizon. The clear sky fills the top left portion of the frame. The camera is positioned at a low angle, level with the car's wheel, and moves in unison with the vehicle, keeping the car static in the frame while the background scenery rushes past from left to right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A level, close-up view captures the front passenger side of a light pink sports car as it moves. The car's dark gray, multi-spoke wheel, which has a silver rim, is shown spinning rapidly. A small, black, textured carbon fiber piece is attached to the fender just behind the wheel. Further back, the side of the car is gray with white, green, yellow, and blue decals visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot, mounted near the front wheel of a car, captures the vehicle speeding across a vast, flat expanse. The ground is a dark, barren surface, possibly a dry lakebed or runway, stretching towards a distant, hazy mountain range under a clear, bright blue sky during the daytime. The car's body is a light pink color, with a black carbon fiber accent visible on the rear quarter panel. The multi-spoke wheel, featuring a dark finish and a light-colored outer lip, spins rapidly, creating motion blur against the fast-moving ground.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera captures half of a car, while the other half of the frame shows a wide-scenery shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
