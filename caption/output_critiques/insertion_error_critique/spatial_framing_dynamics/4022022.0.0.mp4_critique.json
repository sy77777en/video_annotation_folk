    "pre_caption": "This video is a wide, top-down aerial scenery shot of a roof under construction. Initially, the new OSB-paneled roof occupies the majority of the frame in the foreground, extending from the top left to the bottom right. A ladder is positioned in the bottom left, leaning against the roof, while a yellow power tool sits on the ground in the bottom center. Green grass is visible in the middle ground on the right side of the frame. The camera, positioned directly above the scene, glides forward, revealing a safety harness and other tools in the top left of the frame on the roof. This movement transitions the view entirely to an older, weathered wooden roof, which fills the foreground of the frame, while the green grass shifts to the bottom left edge.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents an aerial scenery shot, initially focusing on a roof under construction, characterized by light brown oriented strand board (OSB) panels, some marked with blue chalk lines, and construction equipment like a ladder, a yellow power tool, and a safety harness. The camera then transitions to reveal an older, weathered wooden roof composed of dark brown planks, showing signs of age with gaps between the boards and remnants of black roofing material. There is no main subject as the camera's top-down perspective and movement emphasize the textures, materials, and overall state of the different roof surfaces, highlighting the contrast between new construction and aged structures rather than a specific focal point.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides a bird's-eye perspective of a roof undergoing construction or repair during the daytime. Initially, the view focuses on newly installed light brown OSB (Oriented Strand Board) sheathing, characterized by its wood chip texture and rectangular panels. Various construction items are visible on and around this section, including a yellow power tool, an aluminum ladder leaning against the roof edge, a safety harness, yellow extension cords, and ropes. The surrounding ground shows green grass and a portion of a chain-link fence. As the drone moves, the view transitions to an older section of the roof, revealing weathered, dark brown wooden planks. These planks show signs of age, with some areas covered in black patches, possibly remnants of old roofing material or water damage, and some gaps between them.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
