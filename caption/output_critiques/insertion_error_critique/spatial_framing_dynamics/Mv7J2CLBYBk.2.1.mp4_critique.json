    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a wide shot, where a silhouetted man is positioned in the background, center, at the far end of a dimly lit corridor. The corridor walls are visible on the left and right, extending from the foreground to the background. A brighter rectangular opening, containing a partially visible sign, is located in the background, center, behind the man. As the man runs towards the camera, moving from the background into the middle ground, the shot transitions to a full shot, making him appear larger in the frame while remaining in the center. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man, visible as a dark silhouette against a brighter area behind him, runs towards the viewer. He wears what appears to be a long, open coat or robe that billows with his movement. His lower legs are bare, suggesting he is wearing shorts or short trousers, and his hair appears short.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dimly lit indoor corridor, with dark, plain walls on either side. At the far end of the corridor, a brighter, rectangular opening reveals a glimpse of an exterior or a well-lit room. Within this opening, a large, light-colored sign is partially visible, featuring dark blue text that includes \"A330\" and a stylized logo. A silhouetted figure, wearing what appears to be a long coat, is seen approaching the camera, moving away from the brighter area of the corridor. The overall atmosphere is dark and shadowy, with the primary light source emanating from the end of the hallway.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
