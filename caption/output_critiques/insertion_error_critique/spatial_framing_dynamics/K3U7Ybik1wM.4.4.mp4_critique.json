    "pre_caption": "In a close-up, first-person perspective shot, a hand is held up in the foreground, positioned in the center-left of the frame. In the middle ground, the person's legs and bare feet are visible on the right side, extending toward the bottom of the frame. The background is split, with a brightly lit window on the right and a dimly lit wall on the left. The camera remains static at the subject's level, simulating their point of view while lying down. A visual distortion effect creates a shimmering red and green outline around the hand in the foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person perspective, a person with light skin is seen lying on a bed. Their left hand is held up in front of the camera, with the palm open and facing forward, bathed in a warm, reddish-orange light. The person is wearing blue jeans, and their bare feet are visible resting further down on the bed.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, a hand is held up in the foreground while lying on a bed in a dimly lit room. A warm, orange light from the side illuminates the palm, and a slight visual distortion creates a shimmering red and green outline around the fingers. In the midground, the person's legs, covered in blue jeans, and bare feet are visible further down the bed. A window with curtains shows a bright, out-of-focus view of trees and a car outside. The room's walls are beige-colored, with a small, framed picture hanging in the distance.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
