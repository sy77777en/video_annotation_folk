    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of the subjects, capturing the upper bodies of the young boy and the hand of the unseen person. The boy is centrally positioned in the foreground, seated at a table, while the hand enters from the right side of the frame, also in the foreground. The boy remains mostly stationary, facing forward, with green tubes extending from his ears. The hand moves slightly, gently wiping the boy's nose with a tissue. In the background, medical posters and part of a computer screen are visible on the left side, indicating a medical or educational setting. The camera maintains a consistent height, positioned at the boy's level, ensuring both the boy and the hand remain the focal points throughout the video. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial positioning, maintaining a steady focus on the interaction between the boy and the hand.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a young animated boy with light skin, short brown hair, and brown eyes, wearing a white shirt and a green vest. He is seated at a table, facing forward with a calm expression. Green tubes are coming out of each ear. A hand, belonging to an unseen person, is gently wiping the boy's nose with a tissue throughout the video. The hand has light skin and is wearing a green short-sleeved shirt. The focus is on the boy's reaction to having his nose wiped.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set indoors in a brightly lit room, likely a medical or educational setting, characterized by pastel-colored walls and a clean, organized environment. Sunlight is visible on the wall, adding to the brightness of the room. A young child with short brown hair is seated at a table, interacting with an adult. The child is wearing a green vest over a white shirt, and the adult is dressed in a green uniform. The table is simple, with a smooth surface, and a few papers are visible, along with a computer, about half of its screen visible in the frame. Several medical posters are displayed on the walls. The lighting is soft and even, suggesting daytime. The scene captures a moment of interaction, with the adult gently holding a tissue to the child's face. The overall atmosphere is calm and focused, with a clear emphasis on the interaction between the two subjects.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
