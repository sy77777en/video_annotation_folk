    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium close-up shot of a woman in a bathtub, with her head occupying approximately one-third of the frame's height and positioned slightly to the right of center. The foam in the tub obscures her body below the neck, placing her in the foreground while the bathtub edges and surrounding bathroom elements form the middle ground. The radiator is located in the background, towards the top left, and a blue towel hangs on the wall in the top right. The camera remains at the subject's eye level throughout. Initially, the woman's face is calm, with cucumber slices covering her eyes. As the video progresses, the cucumber slice on her nose falls, and her expression changes; she opens her mouth wide in what appears to be a scream. The camera maintains a steady position, capturing the transition from a relaxed state to a sudden reaction without any noticeable shift in shot size or angle. The spatial arrangement remains consistent, focusing on the subject's head and upper torso against the backdrop of the bathroom setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a woman in a bathtub filled with foam, obscuring her body below the neck. Her head, positioned slightly to the right of center, occupies about one-third of the frame's height. She has a light skin tone and wears a pink towel wrapped around her head. Her eyes are covered with cucumber slices, and she has headphones on. Initially, her expression is relaxed, but later, the cucumber slices fall, and she seems to see something and scream, with her mouth open wide.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor bathroom setting with a person relaxing in a bathtub filled with white, frothy bubbles. The room features a radiator and a blue towel. It shows a muted color palette, with soft natural light, suggesting the daytime. The person in the tub has a towel wrapped around their head and wears headphones, with cucumber slices placed over their eyes.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a woman in a bathtub filled with foam, making her body below her head invisible beneath the foam. Her head occupies about one-third of the frame's height and is positioned to the right of the center.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
