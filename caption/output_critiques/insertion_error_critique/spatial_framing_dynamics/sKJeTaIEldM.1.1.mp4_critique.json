    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a close-up shot of the subject, focusing on their upper body and head. Initially, the subject is positioned in the bottom left of the frame, occupying the foreground. As the scene progresses, the shot transitions to a wide shot, capturing more of the environment. The subject moves from the bottom left towards the center of the frame, ascending the staircase. In the wide shot, the subject is now in the middle ground, with the staircase and its metallic railing prominently featured in the center and extending into the background. The hanging light fixture is positioned in the top center of the frame, suspended in the middle ground. Decorative plants are visible in the background, adding depth to the scene. The camera height shifts from being at the subject's level to below them, emphasizing the ascent up the stairs. This change in perspective enhances the sense of movement and progression within the space.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a dimly lit interior scene with a staircase. A person is present, characterized by a dark silhouette, making specific details about their appearance difficult to discern. They have shoulder-length, slightly curly hair and are positioned near the staircase, suggesting movement or interaction with it. The back of their t-shirt seems to display two large white numbers or letters. The staircase has a sleek, metallic railing, and a distinctive hanging light fixture is visible, casting a soft glow. The setting includes some foliage, possibly decorative plants, adding texture to the scene. The overall atmosphere is shadowy, with limited visibility of the person's features and attire.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting during nighttime, characterized by dim lighting and a modern architectural style. The environment features a staircase with a sleek, metallic handrail that curves elegantly. A large, decorative light fixture hangs from the ceiling, swinging erratically and casting a dynamic glow. The walls are adorned with leafy plants, adding a natural element to the scene. The atmosphere is tense, with shadows playing across the surfaces, enhancing the contrast between light and dark areas. A person is running up the stairs quickly and chaotically, contributing to a sense of urgency and disorder. The setting suggests a contemporary interior with a focus on clean lines and minimalistic design elements.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to below the subject.",
