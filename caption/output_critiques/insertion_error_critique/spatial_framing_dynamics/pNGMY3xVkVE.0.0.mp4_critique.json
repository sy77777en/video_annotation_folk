    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, a group of people is framed from behind, occupying the foreground and middle ground as they walk away from the camera down the center of a tunnel. The tunnel walls frame the shot on the left, right, and top, creating a path that recedes into the background. Initially, a red light source from behind the camera illuminates the subjects. As the group moves forward from the middle ground toward the background, a bright white light source at the tunnel's exit in the center background expands and intensifies, progressively backlighting the figures and turning them into silhouettes. The camera remains stationary and positioned at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a group of people walking through a tunnel. The individuals are mostly men, wearing casual clothing such as t-shirts, hoodies, and jeans. The lighting in the tunnel shifts from a dim red to a bright white, creating a dramatic contrast. The camera angle shows their backs as they walk towards a bright light at the end of the tunnel, emphasizing their movement and transition as the group progresses forward.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting within a dimly lit tunnel, characterized by its metallic walls and ceiling. The environment transitions from a dark, red-tinged atmosphere, with the red light originating from within the tunnel, to a bright, white light coming from outside as the exit gradually opens. The tunnel's structure is cylindrical, with ribbed metal surfaces that create a sense of depth and confinement. The lighting shifts dramatically, initially casting a red hue that highlights the silhouettes of several figures walking towards the exit. As the scene progresses and the exit opens further, the intensity of the bright white light increases, enveloping the figures and creating a stark contrast with the initial darkness. The overall ambiance is industrial, with a focus on the interplay between light and shadow, emphasizing the tunnel's linear perspective.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
