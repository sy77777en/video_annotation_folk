    "pre_caption": "This video presents a static, extreme wide shot of a city scenery at night, captured from a low-angle perspective. The composition focuses on the urban environment rather than a specific subject. A large, illuminated building occupies the center and right-center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. The foreground consists of a cobblestone street spanning the bottom of the frame, where long, horizontal light trails from traffic move across the scene. On the far left, another building stands in the middle ground. To the right, a tree and a cylindrical column are also located in the middle ground. The dark sky fills the background at the top of the frame, and a text overlay is fixed in the bottom right corner.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a dynamic cityscape scenery shot, capturing a bustling city street corner at night through a long-exposure or time-lapse technique. A grand, multi-story building with classical architecture, warmly illuminated against the dark sky, dominates the frame, featuring a prominent red and white circular banner on its facade. Streaks of white and red light from moving traffic flow across the cobblestone street in the foreground, creating a sense of motion and energy. There is no single main subject, as the composition is designed to showcase the overall urban atmosphere, the architectural grandeur, and the vibrant flow of city life rather than focusing on a specific person or object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A long-exposure, time-lapse shot captures a Parisian street corner at night. In the center, a grand, multi-story building with classical architecture, the Comédie-Française, is illuminated by warm lights. A large, circular red and white banner is affixed to its facade. The foreground features a cobblestone street where the movement of traffic, including a bus, creates long, horizontal streaks of white and red light. To the right, a tree with some foliage and a cylindrical advertising column are visible, while other lit buildings stand in the background under a dark sky. An overlay in the bottom right corner contains the text \"MATHIEU STANIĆ\" and \"CINEMATOGRAPHY\".**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
