    "pre_caption": "This wide shot, filmed from a high angle above the subject, initially frames a humanoid character in the middle ground, positioned center-left next to a fenced garden plot on the right. As the character walks towards the bottom left, the camera pans left to follow, revealing a circular stone well that moves to occupy the center of the frame. The character then walks around the well and stops beside it, ending in the center of the shot. Throughout the video, HUD elements remain static in the foreground: a coin count is at the bottom left, an inventory bar is at the bottom center, and two status bars are at the bottom right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A stylized, humanoid character with an atypical appearance is present in a garden setting. The character has a round, orange head with carved oval black eyes and a carved smile, resembling a jack-o'-lantern. The circular mask on which these features are carved appears to be made of wood. It is dressed in a long, hooded, purple-gray cloak that conceals its torso and arms, from which thin, black, stick-like legs and feet protrude. The scene also contains a circular stone well with a wooden frame and a bucket, surrounded by a patterned brick path. Nearby are rectangular garden plots filled with tilled brown soil and enclosed by white picket fences, some of which are askew. Within one plot, small, green-leafed saplings are growing in rows.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person 3D game video where the entire character is visible on screen shows a cartoon-styled outdoor garden area at dusk. The scene is illuminated by a warm glow from a lit lantern on a post. The grassy landscape contains several tilled garden plots enclosed by white picket fences; some plots have small green saplings, while another has seeds planted in neat rows. A central feature is a stone well with a wooden roof, surrounded by a circular brick pathway. A small, cloaked character with a round, orange-tinted face walks across the grass, leaving a trail of faint pink particles. In the bottom left corner, a HUD overlay displays a gold coin icon with the number 123. At the bottom center is an inventory bar with icons of bags, a stick, and an orb. On the bottom right, two vertical status bars, one blue and one yellow, are visible.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
