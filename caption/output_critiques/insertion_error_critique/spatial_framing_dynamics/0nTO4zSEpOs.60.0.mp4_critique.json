    "pre_caption": "This wide shot, captured from a forward-moving, normal-height perspective, looks toward a large staircase under an urban overpass at night. Initially, a man in a white shirt walks from the left foreground toward the camera and exits the frame on the left. In the center of the middle ground, a wide staircase is the focal point, with several pedestrians descending it, moving from the middle ground toward the foreground. Among them, a man in a blue jacket and another in a plaid shirt are visible. A yellow tactile paving line runs from the bottom center of the frame toward the stairs. The entire scene is framed by the overpass structure at the top and temporary construction walls on the left and right sides. As the camera moves forward, the perspective dollies in on the staircase and the people on it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A group of pedestrians, most wearing either black or white face masks, walk through a pedestrian overpass area at night. A man with dark hair, wearing a white shirt, dark pants, and a backpack, walks toward the camera. Behind him, a brunette with long hair, dressed in a beige long-sleeved brown dress and dark sneakers, also walks forward. In the midground, several people descend a wide staircase. Among them is a man in a blue jacket and dark pants, and another man behind him wearing a white shirt. Further back, a person is visible wearing a red plaid shirt underneath a blue jacket. Other individuals are visible further up the stairs and in the background.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves forward at night under a large, modern overpass in an urban area. The scene is illuminated by lights on the underside of the white concrete and metal structure. In the center, a wide set of concrete stairs with metal railings leads up to another level, primarily used by pedestrians, with some ascending and others descending. The ground is paved with asphalt and marked with a thick yellow line, indicating the path for the visually impaired. On either side of the walkway, temporary white walls and construction scaffolding are visible, along with several blue signs bearing Japanese text. All pedestrians are wearing face masks. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays the text \"VIRTUAL JAPAN.TV\".**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
