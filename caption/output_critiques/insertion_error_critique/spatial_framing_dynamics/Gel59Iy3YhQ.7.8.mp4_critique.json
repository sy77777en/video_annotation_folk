    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot of a young woman positioned in the center of the frame, with her glowing blue necklace as the central focal point. The camera then tilts upward, transitioning into a close-up that shifts the focus to her face. In the final composition, her face is framed in the center-right, while the top of her glowing staff occupies the foreground on the left. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout this movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a young woman with light brown skin, short, dark, messy hair, and large, dark eyes. She wears a white, sleeveless, pinstriped top, a blue cowl with visible stitching draped over her right shoulder, and a dark armband on her left bicep. Around her neck is a necklace with a teardrop-shaped pendant that emits a bright blue glow, appearing segmented due to its attachment to the string. She holds a gnarled, dark wooden staff in her right hand, the top of which also glows blue. Her expression is serious and focused as she looks slightly upward.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit, dark setting, a young character is illuminated by a blue light. The glow emanates from a cleverly tied single-stone pendant on a necklace, creating the illusion of a three-stoned pendant, and from the top of a gnarled, dark wooden staff she holds. The character wears a white, pinstriped tank top and a blue scarf with visible stitching around her neck and shoulders. The staff has a light-colored cloth wrapping around its handle. The character has dark hair and looks slightly upward as the view shifts from the necklace to her face.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
