    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a static medium shot, featuring a red delivery bag with cardboard boxes stacked on it in the bottom-left foreground. A dark gray apartment door is positioned in the center middle ground, with the number \"186\" plaque located top-center above it. The door opens, and a man, captured in a full shot, emerges from the center of the frame. He steps forward toward the bottom-left foreground, picks up the cardboard boxes, and then moves back into the apartment, closing the door. Shortly after, a second man, also in a full shot, walks into the frame from the right, moves to the bottom-left foreground, and picks up the red bag. The camera remains stationary and at the subjects' height throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a red, square, insulated delivery bag with black straps and a red top flap placed on the floor in front of a dark gray apartment door. Three light brown cardboard boxes are stacked on top of the bag. A light-skinned man with short blond hair, wearing a pink face mask, a light gray button-up shirt over a blue t-shirt, and black pants, opens the door from the inside. He steps out, picks up the cardboard boxes, and goes back into the apartment, closing the door. A moment later, a second light-skinned man with curly dark brown hair, wearing a white hoodie, blue jeans, and a pink face mask, walks into view from the right and picks up the red delivery bag.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place in an indoor hallway of an apartment building with white walls, a light-colored tiled floor, and dark brown baseboards. A dark gray metal door, marked with the number \"186\" on a plaque above, is centrally located. In front of the door sits a red insulated delivery bag with black straps, topped with three stacked cardboard pizza boxes. The door opens, and a person wearing a mask emerges to pick up the pizza boxes before going back inside and closing the door. The apartment's interior, briefly visible, contains a plant and a wooden stool. Later, another person in a mask enters the hallway and picks up the red delivery bag. A second dark door is visible further down the corridor.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a red bag placed at the entrance of a closed apartment door, with a cardboard box on top of it. Then, a full shot of a man opening the apartment door, going out, picking up the cardboard box, then going back into the apartment and closing the door. Shortly after, another man walks into the frame from the right, picks up the bag at the entrance of the apartment.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: There is no subject at the beginning. Once the subject appears, the camera is at the same height as the subject, and the camera height remains unchanged.",
