    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a wide shot of a hot air balloon, capturing its full form against a vast, snow-covered landscape. The balloon is centered in the frame, occupying the middle ground, while the snowy terrain stretches out in the background. As the drone moves closer, the shot size transitions from a wide view to a medium close-up, focusing more on the balloon's upper portion. The balloon remains in the center of the frame throughout this transition, maintaining its position in the middle ground. The camera continues to move upward and closer, eventually filling the frame with the balloon's top, which now dominates the view. This shift places the balloon's top in the foreground, with the rest of the balloon and the landscape receding into the background. After crossing over the balloon, the camera angle changes to an overhead view of the snowy terrain below. The camera is now positioned above the ground, providing a bird's-eye view of the winding roads and scattered trees. In this new perspective, the landscape occupies the entire frame, with the white subtitle text appearing near the bottom center. The camera maintains this overhead position, capturing the expansive snowy expanse and the intricate patterns of the roads and trees. The transition from the balloon to the ground is smooth, with the camera moving seamlessly from one",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a hot air balloon with a colorful design, including red, white, and blue vertical stripes and visible text, floating over a snow-covered landscape. As the drone moves closer, the balloon's top becomes the primary focus, eventually transitioning to a bird's eye angle view of the snowy terrain below. The ground is covered in snow with scattered trees, and white subtitle text appears, providing location information.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a drone POV, showcases a vast, snowy landscape in Levi, Arctic Circle, Finland. The setting is outdoors, featuring a sprawling expanse of snow-covered terrain interspersed with dense clusters of evergreen trees. The time of day appears to be either early morning or late afternoon, as indicated by the soft, diffused light and the low position of the sun on the horizon. A notable visual element is a hot air balloon with a colorful design, including red, white, and blue stripes, floating above the landscape. The balloon's material appears smooth and glossy. The scene transitions to an aerial view of a winding, snow-covered road, surrounded by trees, emphasizing the natural beauty and isolation of the area. Overlay elements include text indicating \"LEVI. Arctic Circle, Finland\" prominently displayed in the center, along with a disclaimer at the bottom about professional driving conditions.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The drone shot begins with a wide view of a hot air balloon. As the drone approaches, the balloon's top gradually fills the frame until only the top is visible. After crossing over the balloon, the view transitions to a snow-covered ground, eventually revealing white subtitle text in the frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
