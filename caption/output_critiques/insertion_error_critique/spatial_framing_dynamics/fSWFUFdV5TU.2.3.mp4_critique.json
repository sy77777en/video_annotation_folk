    "pre_caption": "In an extreme close-up, a person's eye is positioned in the right foreground of the static frame. To the left, the out-of-focus eyepiece of an instrument occupies the foreground. The background is entirely dark. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In an extreme close-up, a person with light skin and a brown eye looks intently into the eyepiece of an optical instrument. Their eye is wide, and their long eyelashes are clearly visible. A few strands of light brown or blonde hair are visible near their temple. The out-of-focus instrument they are looking through is dark with a golden, ribbed section near the person's eye. The scene is dimly lit with warm light highlighting the side of the person's face.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an extremely close-up shot set against a black background, a person's light brown eye is visible on the right. The eye, framed by long lashes, is looking through the eyepiece of an instrument on the left. The instrument is dark and cylindrical, with a ridged, out-of-focus section that has a warm, golden hue. A small amount of light-colored, curly hair is visible above the person's brow. The scene is illuminated by warm, directional light.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
