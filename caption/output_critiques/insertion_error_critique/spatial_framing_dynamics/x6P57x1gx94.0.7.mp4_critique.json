    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a low-angle wide shot from a fisheye lens, showing a man on a skateboard in the center-frame middle ground, positioned on a large pink ramp that dominates the foreground. As he skates toward the camera, the framing transitions to a full shot at the peak of his jump, which takes him directly over the camera's position. After landing, he moves away from the camera into the center of the plaza, which now occupies the middle ground, and his figure diminishes in size as he recedes into the background, returning the scene to a wide shot. Throughout the clip, buildings occupy the background, their architectural lines appearing curved due to the lens distortion.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man skateboarding. He is wearing a white t-shirt and dark pants. Initially, he is seen approaching the camera, performing a jump on his skateboard. After landing, he continues to skate away from the camera. The man is the central focus throughout, showcasing his skateboarding skills.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Shot from a low, wide-angle fisheye perspective, the scene is set in a sunlit urban plaza on a clear day. A large, bright pink, U-shaped structure with white sides stands prominently on the light-colored tiled pavement. The plaza is surrounded by multi-story buildings, including a modern white structure with numerous windows, all seen under a blue sky with a few clouds. The fisheye lens distorts the view, causing the straight lines of the architecture and the horizon to appear curved. A person on a skateboard moves from the pink structure out into the open space of the plaza.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a man skateboarding, starting with a wide shot. As he approaches the camera, he jumps, transitioning to a full shot. After landing, he moves away, returning to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
