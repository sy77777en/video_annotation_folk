    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective inside a spaceship cockpit, the scene opens with the ship's dashboard in the foreground, occupying the bottom of the frame. A large, reddish-brown planet fills the upper and right portions of the view, while a bright orange sun is positioned in the lower-left background against a star-filled sky. The viewpoint moves forward and descends into a canyon on the planet. As the ship progresses, the canyon walls move past on the top and right sides of the frame. A large, metallic, cross-shaped structure appears in the upper-center middle ground, and a faint, glowing white wisp becomes visible in the center of the canyon ahead. The sun remains consistently in the lower-left background throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video shows a first-person perspective from inside the cockpit of a spaceship. The dashboard in the foreground features a black screen and another screen on the left displaying a schematic of the ship's systems. Through the cockpit window, a large, bright orange sun with visible solar flares occupies the lower-left portion of the view. A massive, reddish-brown, cratered planet with deep canyons dominates the upper and right sides of the scene. A large, complex, metallic structure, shaped like a cross within a ring and adorned with glowing purple lights, floats in space above the planet's surface. A faint, glowing, white wisp of light is also visible within one of the planet's canyons against the backdrop of star-filled space.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a view from the cockpit of a spaceship flying through a deep canyon on a reddish, rocky celestial body. A massive, glowing orange sun with visible solar flares dominates the lower left, illuminating the dark, star-filled space and the craggy canyon walls. In the distance, a faint, glowing, geometric structure can be seen. The foreground shows the spaceship's dashboard, featuring a screen with a ship schematic. Overlays are present on the screen, displaying gameplay information such as \"(Hold) Match Velocity\" in the top left, and location details like \"Ember Twin\" along with speed and equipment options in the top right.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
