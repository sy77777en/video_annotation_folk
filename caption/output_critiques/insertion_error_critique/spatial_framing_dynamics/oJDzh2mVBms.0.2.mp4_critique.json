    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide scenery shot captured from a low angle. In the middle ground, a white research station is positioned slightly to the right of center, flanked by evergreen trees on the left and right. Piles of snow occupy the foreground at the bottom of the frame. The background is filled with the night sky, where the Milky Way stretches across the upper frame. A dynamic aurora borealis is the primary moving element; it begins as a prominent green arc in the top left and a fainter red-hued band in the top right, and proceeds to shift and dance across the entire upper portion of the sky in a time-lapse sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video is an astronomical time-lapse scenery shot capturing a spectacular celestial event in a remote, snowy landscape. There is no single main subject, as the focus is on the immense scale and atmosphere of the natural light show in the sky, with a small, white research station serving as a point of reference. A vibrant aurora borealis, with prominent green and subtle red hues, dances in a massive, shifting arc across the star-dusted heavens. The dense, glowing band of the Milky Way is also visible, stretching across the sky alongside the dynamic aurora, creating a breathtaking cosmic display.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a remote, snowy landscape at night, a white, rectangular building with antennas and a satellite dish is surrounded by evergreen trees and deep snow. Above, the clear night sky is filled with stars, revealing the Milky Way. A large, dynamic aurora borealis arches across the sky, with its colors shifting from vibrant green to hues of pink and purple as it moves.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
