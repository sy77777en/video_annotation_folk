    "pre_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a cityscape, focusing on the vast urban scenery. In the foreground, tall skyscrapers frame the shot on the left, right, and bottom. The middle ground is occupied by a dense urban grid and a parking lot, where multiple explosions erupt at street level, sending smoke plumes upward. In the background, a distant city skyline is visible across a body of water, positioned at the top of the frame. The entire scene is captured from a high-angle aerial perspective, looking down upon the metropolis.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a dramatic cityscape scenery shot, capturing a sprawling metropolis under attack from an aerial perspective. The scene is dominated by towering skyscrapers under a hazy, golden sky, with a distant skyline visible across a body of water. Throughout the urban grid, multiple explosions erupt at street level, sending plumes of dark smoke billowing upwards. The focus is not on a single subject but on the vast scale of the city and the widespread chaos, emphasizing the environmental destruction rather than a specific focal point.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a high-angle view of a sprawling metropolis under a hazy, sunlit sky. The scene overlooks a dense cluster of modern skyscrapers, with a major highway and a large body of water visible in the distance, separating the city from another skyline on the horizon. The long shadows cast by the buildings suggest either early morning or late afternoon. At street level, multiple explosions erupt simultaneously, sending plumes of grey smoke and dust billowing up between the tall buildings and across a parking lot.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
