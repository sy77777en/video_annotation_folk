    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a high-angle shot focused on the lower half of a girl, whose bare feet are positioned in the top center of the frame in the middle ground. To the top left are metal dishes, and to the top right is a stack of folded fabrics, both also in the middle ground. A blurry element is visible in the extreme foreground at the bottom of the screen. The shot then reveals the rest of the girl, transitioning into a full shot as she looks up. She remains in the center of the frame in the middle ground, with the camera positioned high above her.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a high-angle shot showing the bare feet of a young girl standing on a dark, uneven floor. As the view reveals more of her, she is shown to be an animated character, possibly a puppet, with dark skin. She has large brown eyes, thick eyebrows, and dark hair styled in two long braids. The girl is wearing a dark blue pinafore dress over a white, short-sleeved collared shirt. She gazes straight ahead in the general direction of the camera with a wide-eyed, open-mouthed expression.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors, featuring a textured, multicolored floor with a mix of earthy tones like brown, yellow, and red. The environment is dimly lit, suggesting a cozy, intimate atmosphere. A small figure with braided hair and a simple outfit stands on the floor, gazing straight ahead in the general direction of the camera. Nearby, there are objects such as a cup, a stack of metal dish plates, and a stack of fabrics, adding to the lived-in feel of the space. The setting conveys a sense of warmth and familiarity, with the focus on the interaction between the figure and the surrounding elements.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a full shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned above the subject.",
