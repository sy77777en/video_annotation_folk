    "pre_caption": "A close-up shot frames a lizard's head, which is positioned in the center of the frame and occupies the foreground. The lizard faces the camera directly. The background is out of focus, creating a shallow depth of field. The camera remains static and is positioned at the lizard's eye level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A lizard is shown in a close-up, facing directly towards the viewer. Its skin is covered in small, rough scales, exhibiting a mottled pattern of gray, brown, and possibly some greenish hues. The scales on its chin and neck are lighter, appearing almost white or very light gray with darker speckles, while the scales on the top of its head are a more uniform brownish-gray. The lizard has dark, round pupils set within lighter irises. Its head is somewhat triangular from this frontal view, with a noticeable V-shaped ridge or crest running from between its eyes towards the back of its head, and pronounced brow ridges above the eyes. The scales around its chin and neck appear slightly raised or spiky.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A close-up, head-on view shows a lizard with textured, gray and brown scales. The creature's head is centered, with its eyes looking forward. The background is out of focus, consisting of muted, earthy tones that suggest a natural, outdoor environment during the day. The lighting highlights the intricate, bumpy texture of the lizard's skin, particularly on its snout and prominent brow ridges.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
