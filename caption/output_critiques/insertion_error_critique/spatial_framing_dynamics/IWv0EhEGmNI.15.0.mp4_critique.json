    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a full shot of a man sitting in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground amidst a pile of rubble that occupies the foreground. A ruined brick wall is visible in the background. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, slowly pushes in, transitioning the shot into a medium close-up that focuses on the man's face and upper torso. As the camera moves closer, the man turns his head slightly to his left. Throughout the shot, dialogue text is overlaid at the bottom of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with a beard and mustache is shown in a green, hazy environment. He is wearing a green camouflage military uniform, a tactical vest with pouches, and a black helmet equipped with what appears to be night-vision goggles and headphones. He is sitting or lying amidst a pile of broken bricks and rubble, holding a rifle across his lap. The camera moves closer to the man, making him appear larger in the frame, as he turns his face slightly to his left.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within the ruins of a building, filled with piles of broken bricks and concrete rubble. The entire environment is bathed in an eerie, monochromatic green light and filled with a thick haze or smoke that obscures the background. A partially collapsed brick wall stands amidst the debris. At the bottom of the screen, the characters' names are displayed in green text, and their dialogue is in white text as an overlay, reading: \"Price: Clear your head, son.\" and \"Kyle: Never been more clear, sir...\"**\n\nPlease note that the **main subject’s framing (shot size) is not stable** throughout the video, so the description should emphasize this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
