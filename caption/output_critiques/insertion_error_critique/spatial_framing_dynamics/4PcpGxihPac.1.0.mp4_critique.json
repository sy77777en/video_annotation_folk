    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide shot captures two people on camels positioned in the center of the frame, traversing the middle ground from left to right across vast orange sand dunes. In the foreground, a dark, rocky slope occupies the bottom-left corner. A small green bush sits in the bottom-right of the frame, also in the middle ground. The background is dominated by a range of dark, rocky mountains, with a distinct pyramid-shaped peak located in the center-left. The camera is positioned at a high angle, looking down on the subjects and the expansive landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Two people are seen riding on the backs of two separate camels. The person on the left camel wears light-colored, possibly beige, flowing robes and a matching head covering. The person on the right camel is dressed in similar attire, but their robes and head covering are white. Both individuals are seated upright on their respective camels, which are walking one behind the other across the landscape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A vast desert landscape unfolds under a pale blue sky, characterized by rolling dunes of orange sand. In the middle distance, two figures ride camels, moving across the expansive terrain. The background is dominated by a range of dark, rocky mountains, one of which has a distinct pyramid-like shape. A rocky, dark brown slope occupies the left foreground, while a small, green bush sits on the right. In the far distance, the landscape flattens into a plain.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
