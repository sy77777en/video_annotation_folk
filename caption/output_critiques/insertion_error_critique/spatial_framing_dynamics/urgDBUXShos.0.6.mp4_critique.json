    "pre_caption": "The scene begins with a close-up, positioning the woman's profile on the left side of the frame and the man's profile on the right, with both subjects in the foreground. In the background, blurred figures of other people are visible. The camera then rotates in an arc around the man, moving from his left side to his back, which momentarily blocks the woman from view. The camera continues its rotation to his right side, settling into a medium close-up where the subjects' positions within the frame have swapped: the man is now on the left and the woman is on the right. Throughout this movement, the camera remains at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with white face paint, smeared red lipstick, dark eye makeup, and messy, shoulder-length, greenish-yellow hair stands in close proximity to a woman with brown hair styled in an updo. The man, wearing a dark purple jacket, uses his left black-gloved hand to support the woman's neck while his right black-gloved hand presses a small, sharp blade to her cheek. The woman, wearing a dark green sleeveless top, has her head tilted back. The perspective shifts, circling around the man, initially showing him on the right and the woman on the left, before his back momentarily obscures her, and the view settles with the man on the left and the woman on the right.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place indoors within a large, dimly lit room. The background is intentionally blurred, revealing the indistinct silhouettes of numerous people, suggesting a formal gathering. In the foreground, a man with green-tinted, wavy hair, white face paint, and smeared red lipstick is dressed in a purple jacket and black leather gloves. He holds a small, silver blade with a black handle to the face of a woman with brown hair who is wearing a dark green dress. The overall lighting is low, with the primary focus on the two central figures.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The shot begins with a close-up of the woman's side on the left side of the frame and the clown's side on the right side. The camera rotates around the clown, moving from the left side view to the back and then to the right side view. During this transition, the woman is momentarily blocked by the clown. In the end, the positions of the two characters in the frame swap, with the clown on the left and the woman on the right, showing a medium close-up shot of them.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
