    "pre_caption": "This wide shot presents a static, low-angle view of a night sky. In the foreground, a large rock formation occupies the bottom left of the frame, while a second rock formation is positioned on the bottom right. The background is filled by the sky, which undergoes a time-lapse transition. Initially, wispy clouds move across the center and top of the frame. These clouds gradually dissipate, revealing a clear, dark sky densely populated with stars and the luminous band of the Milky Way, which becomes prominent in the center and upper regions of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video presents a landscape scenery shot, capturing a dramatic time-lapse of the night sky over a rugged, rocky terrain. Initially, wispy clouds streak across a dusky blue sky, gradually clearing to reveal a breathtaking celestial display. As darkness deepens, the starfield becomes incredibly dense, with the luminous band of the Milky Way galaxy emerging in stunning detail against the inky blackness. Framing the lower portion of the view are the silhouettes of two large rock formations, their reddish-brown surfaces catching the faint ambient light. There is no single main subject, as the focus is intentionally placed on the vastness of the environment and the atmospheric transition, emphasizing the grand scale of the cosmos against the static, earthly landscape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A time-lapse sequence captures the transition from day to night, starting with a low-angle view of the daytime sky framed by two large, reddish-brown rock formations in the foreground. Initially, wispy white clouds streak rapidly across a blue-grey sky, partially obscuring the sun. As the sequence progresses, the sky darkens, the clouds dissipate completely, and a multitude of stars emerge, revealing the dense, luminous band of the Milky Way.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
