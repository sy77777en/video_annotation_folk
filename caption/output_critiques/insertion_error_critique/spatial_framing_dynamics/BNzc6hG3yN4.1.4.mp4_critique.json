    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium close-up of a person from a high-angle, overhead perspective, positioned in the center foreground. The person is lying on their back, and the camera slowly pushes in, transitioning to a close-up that frames their face in the center of the shot. The surrounding area is completely dark, with the only visible elements being the person in the foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A Black man is shown from a high-angle, overhead perspective, lying on his back in a very dark setting. He is wearing a dark-colored coat with a white inner lining and a fur-lined hood over a striped t-shirt. A gold chain is visible around his neck. He holds a lit cigarette or joint to his lips, its red, glowing tip providing a small point of light in the otherwise dark environment. His face is partially illuminated by this light, and he appears to be looking upwards.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From an overhead perspective, a person lies on their back in a dark, outdoor setting at night. They wear a dark coat with a white inner lining, visible near their shoulder. The scene is almost entirely engulfed in shadow, with the only illumination coming from a small object with a glowing red tip held near the person's mouth. This faint light casts a warm glow on their face and the front of their coat, while the surrounding area remains in deep darkness.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
