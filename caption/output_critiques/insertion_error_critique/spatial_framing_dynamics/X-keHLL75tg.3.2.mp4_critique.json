    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot, framing two men and a horse in the middle ground of a stable corridor. A man in a black shirt is on the left, looking right, while a man in a white polo shirt is on the right, seen in profile looking left. A brown horse stands between them in the center of the frame. The camera then smoothly zooms in as the man in the white shirt turns to face the camera directly, transitioning the shot into a close-up. In the final framing, he occupies the center-right of the frame, while the horse's head is positioned to his left in the middle ground, and the other man is now mostly out of view on the far left. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a light-skinned man with long, dark brown hair and a small earring in his left ear, wearing a white polo shirt. He is initially seen in profile speaking to another man before turning to face the camera with a wide, toothy smile. To his left stands another light-skinned man with short, dark, curly hair and a mustache, dressed in a black short-sleeved shirt, maintaining a serious expression while looking at the first man. Positioned between them is a brown horse wearing a bridle, facing forward in a stable aisle. A third individual, dressed in a black long-sleeved shirt, has his hand raised near the horse's head.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set inside a long, narrow stable corridor with a concrete floor. On both sides, reddish-brown stalls with barred upper sections line the passageway, creating a strong sense of perspective. The environment is illuminated by horizontal fluorescent light fixtures mounted on the ceiling, which cast a warm, yellowish light throughout the space. In the center of the aisle, a brown horse wearing a halter stands between two men. Other figures can be seen in the blurred background further down the corridor.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
