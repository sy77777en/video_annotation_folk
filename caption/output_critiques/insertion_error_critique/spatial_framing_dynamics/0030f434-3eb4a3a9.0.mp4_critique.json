    "pre_caption": "This wide shot is captured from a stationary, driver's-eye-level perspective inside a vehicle, looking out at a street intersection. In the foreground, the car's dashboard and windshield frame the bottom of the scene. The middle ground is dominated by a continuous flow of cross-traffic moving from right to left across the center. The sequence begins with a white sedan in the center and a yellow taxi on the right, both turning left and exiting the frame. They are followed by several SUVs and cars that also traverse the intersection from right to left. In the top right, a deli with a striped awning stands in the middle ground, with pedestrians on the sidewalk in front of it. A red traffic light hangs in the top center, while residential buildings and trees occupy the background on the left side of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A variety of cars navigate a sunny street intersection. A white sedan with \"OPERATOR\" and a red and blue logo on its side turns left, followed by a yellow taxi cab. Other vehicles, including a silver SUV, a dark SUV, and several black sedans, also pass through the intersection. On the corner, in front of a \"DELI & GRILL\" with a red and white striped awning on the right side of the frame, a woman in a black top and pink pants stands on the sidewalk near a crosswalk. Other pedestrians are also visible on the sidewalk. The traffic light hanging over the intersection is red, with a long line of vehicles waiting in two of the lanes. On the opposite side of the street, across from the deli & grill, there is a two-story residential building.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A forward-facing dashcam view from a vehicle-mounted camera captures the scene ahead at a street intersection on a bright, sunny day under a blue sky with scattered clouds. A traffic light suspended over the asphalt road shows red. On the right corner, a brick building with a red and white striped awning houses a \"Deli & Grill.\" Across the street, residential buildings and green trees line the road. The intersection is active with a continuous flow of cross-traffic, including a white sedan, a yellow taxi, and several SUVs of different colors, while pedestrians are visible on the sidewalk.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
