    "pre_caption": "In an extreme wide shot taken from a high angle, a white airplane is positioned in the center-left of the frame, situated in the middle ground on a taxiway. The airport's runways and taxiways extend from the foreground to the middle ground, interspersed with sections of brown grass. A body of water occupies the background, with a faint city skyline visible at the top of the frame in the far background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a high-angle perspective, a white passenger airplane is situated on a taxiway at an airport. The airport features a complex layout of light brown runways and taxiways, marked with white and yellow lines, which are set against brown, grassy terrain. In the hazy, orange-tinted background, a body of water separates the airport from a distant city skyline.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high-angle perspective, an airport is depicted under a hazy, orange-tinted sky, suggesting either dawn or dusk. A single white passenger airplane is positioned on a taxiway at the intersection with a long, light brown runway marked with white lines. The runway and surrounding light brown taxiways, detailed with yellow lines, are set within expanses of brown grass. In the background, a faint city skyline is visible across a body of water.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
