    "pre_caption": "This wide shot, from a first-person perspective, follows an upward-sloping stone and dirt path that originates in the bottom foreground and extends towards the center-middle ground. On the left, a steep hillside covered in dense, verdant foliage occupies the foreground and middle ground. To the right, the terrain with trees and undergrowth slopes downwards, also spanning the foreground and middle ground. A lone hiker, initially positioned in the top-center of the middle ground, moves further into the background while ascending the path. Distant trees and a small waterfall are visible in the background, to the right of the trail. As the camera advances along the path, foreground elements such as rocks and plants shift towards the edges of the frame or pass out of view, while elements previously in the middle ground, like sections of the path and surrounding vegetation, transition into the foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a nature scenery shot depicting a rugged, upward-sloping stone and dirt path winding through a dense, verdant forest. There is no main subject because the focus is on the immersive environment of the trail itself, the lush foliage clinging to the steep hillside on the left, and the dense trees and undergrowth on the right, conveying the atmosphere and scale of the natural landscape rather than a specific entity. A lone hiker with a red backpack is seen ascending the path in the distance, but they serve more as an element within the scene, emphasizing the trail's use and scale, rather than being the central point of interest.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, shows a perspective moving along a steep, uneven pathway constructed from large, irregularly shaped, light gray and brown stones and packed earth. The outdoor setting is a dense, lush green forest, with abundant vegetation, including ferns and trees, covering the embankments on either side of the trail. On the left side of the path, the terrain slopes upward, while on the right side, it slopes downward. A person wearing a bright red backpack and dark clothing is visible further up the path, walking uphill. The scene is naturally lit, indicating daytime, and in the background, more trees and a small, distant waterfall or stream can be seen to the right of the path.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
