    "pre_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot of a snowy landscape. Initially, a dark wooden house is positioned in the left and center of the frame in the middle ground, with a snow-covered road in the foreground and a forest in the background. The camera then pans smoothly to the right. As it moves, the house shifts to the far-left edge of the frame, and the view opens up to show more of the snow-covered road extending into the middle ground, bordered by large snowbanks. The forest now fills the background across the center and right of the frame. The camera maintains a consistent eye-level height throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a focus on a large, single-story house, setting the scene before the camera smoothly pans to the right. This shift in perspective draws the viewer's attention to the surrounding forest, emphasizing the snowy environment and the expansive, tranquil winter landscape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts a serene winter scene in a snowy, forested area. It is set outdoors during the day, under an overcast sky that casts a soft, diffused light over the landscape. The environment features a wooden cabin with a sloped roof, completely covered in snow, situated alongside a snow-covered road. The cabin is constructed from dark wood, contrasting with the white snow. Tall evergreen trees, their branches dusted with snow, line the background, creating a natural border. As the camera pans to the right, the snowbanks along the road on the right side exhibit a curved shape. The overall atmosphere is calm and still, with no visible movement or activity.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
