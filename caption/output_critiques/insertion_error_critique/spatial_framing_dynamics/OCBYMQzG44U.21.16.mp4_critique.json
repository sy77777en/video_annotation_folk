    "pre_caption": "The video uses a wide shot to capture the architectural scenery, with no main subject present. In the first frame, the wide, curving staircase occupies the bottom and left portions of the frame in the foreground, while the circular tiled wall and large white pillars are positioned in the center and right, extending from the middle ground to the background. The metal handrail follows the curve of the stairs, running from the bottom left toward the center. In the second frame, the camera angle shifts to follow the curve of the staircase as it descends, with the staircase now occupying the bottom and right of the frame in the foreground, the tiled wall dominating the left and center in the middle ground, and the pillars and a pool of water visible in the background at the bottom right. The camera maintains a height slightly above the stairs, angled downward to emphasize the descent and curvature of the space. The spatial framing remains consistent in its focus on the architectural elements, with the camera movement smoothly tracking along the staircase’s path.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents an architectural scenery shot of a sterile, minimalist interior. A wide, curving staircase, covered entirely in small white tiles, descends into a circular space defined by large, plain white pillars and a matching tiled wall. A simple metal handrail follows the curve of the stairs, which lead down towards a pool of water. The scene is bathed in a diffuse, slightly greenish light, creating a clean yet unsettling atmosphere. The video lacks a traditional main subject, as the focus is placed entirely on the liminal and surreal quality of the architecture itself, emphasizing the environment's scale and mood over any specific object or character.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves through an indoor environment dominated by smooth, white tiled surfaces and curved architectural forms. The setting features a wide, spiraling staircase with a metal handrail, descending alongside tall, cylindrical columns and rounded walls. The tiles are small, square, and uniformly white, covering both the floor and walls, creating a clean, continuous appearance. The lighting is soft and diffuse, suggesting artificial illumination without visible light sources, and the overall color palette is monochromatic with subtle greenish undertones. There are no windows or visible decorations, and the space feels enclosed and expansive, with the staircase leading downward toward a darker area partially obscured by the curve of the wall. No overlays, text, or additional visual elements are present in the video.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
