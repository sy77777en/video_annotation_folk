    "pre_caption": "An extreme close-up shot, filmed from above, captures a gold-colored smartphone and a silver utility knife held by a pair of hands in the foreground. The smartphone is positioned diagonally, extending from the left side toward the center of the frame. The utility knife is held on the right, its blade angled toward the phone's camera lens near the center. The hands holding these objects are visible on the left and right edges of the frame. The entire scene is set against a plain white surface in the background, and the framing remains static.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A pair of light-skinned hands holds a gold-colored smartphone and a silver metal utility knife. The close-up shot focuses on the back of the phone, where a prominent camera module with three lenses is visible. The sharp, angled blade of the utility knife is pressed against the gold-colored metal ring of one of the camera lenses, suggesting a scratch test is being performed.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From an overhead POV where the camera is positioned directly above the subject for a top-down perspective, the scene is a close-up against a plain white background. A pair of hands holds a gold-colored smartphone, its prominent triple-lens camera module visible. The blade of a silver utility knife is pressed against one of the circular, gold-rimmed lenses. The entire scene is brightly and evenly lit, indicating an indoor setting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
