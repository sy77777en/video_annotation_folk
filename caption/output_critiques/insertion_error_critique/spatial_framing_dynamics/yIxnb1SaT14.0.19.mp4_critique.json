    "pre_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a Paris Métro station, captured from a fixed high-angle perspective looking down into the scene. The shot is a time-lapse focused on the scenery, with the movement of people and a train being the primary dynamic elements. Initially, a train is stopped at the left platform, occupying the left and center-left of the frame from the foreground to the middle ground. The central tracks run between the left platform and a second platform on the right, which extends from the foreground to the background. As the time-lapse progresses, the train pulls away, moving from the foreground toward the background and revealing the empty tracks in the center. Concurrently, people on both platforms appear as motion blurs moving horizontally through the middle ground, contrasting with the static station architecture and the advertisements lining the wall in the right foreground and middle ground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a time-lapse cityscape scenery shot from a high-angle perspective overlooking a Paris Métro station. There is no main subject, as the focus is on capturing the atmosphere and the constant flow of movement within the urban environment. The technique of blurring the motion of commuters and the departure of a green and white train emphasizes the transient nature of the scene over any individual element. The station itself is characterized by its classic vaulted, white-tiled ceiling and walls, with two platforms flanking the central tracks. As the train pulls away, it reveals the dark, intricate network of rails, while advertisements, including prominent ones for \"MAUBOUSSIN\" and \"PRINTEMPS,\" line the walls, adding a layer of commercial context to the public space.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A time-lapse from a high-angle perspective captures a scene within a Paris Métro station, identified by a blue sign for \"Palais Royal - Musée du Louvre.\" The station features a distinctive arched, vaulted ceiling and walls lined with white brick tiles. A green and white train is initially stopped at the left platform before pulling away, revealing the dark tracks that run through the center of the station. On the platforms on either side, the blurred motion of people indicates the passage of time. The right platform wall is adorned with large advertisements, including one for \"MAUBOUSSIN.\" An overlay in the bottom right corner contains the text \"MATHIEU STANIC PHOTOGRAPHY.\"**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
