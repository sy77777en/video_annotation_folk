    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot, featuring a hot air balloon positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, set against a background of a vast, snow-covered forest below. The camera, positioned at a high angle above the subject, then moves forward and transitions into a top-down perspective. This movement concludes with an extreme close-up, where the top of the balloon's striped envelope fills the entire frame in the foreground, viewed directly from above.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A large hot air balloon with a classic teardrop shape is shown. The balloon's envelope has a pattern of vertical stripes in red, white, and blue, with additional yellow stripes near the top. On a wide white section, the word \"PORSCHE\" is printed in a black, stylized font. Below this, a logo is visible, featuring \"-30°\" in a blue rectangle with a white figure and \"+30°\" in a red rectangle with a white figure. A small, light-colored basket hangs from the bottom of the envelope.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a hot air balloon flying over a vast, snow-covered forest. The landscape below is a dense expanse of evergreen trees blanketed in white snow. The balloon itself is brightly colored with vertical stripes of red, white, blue, and yellow. The word \"PORSCHE\" is visible in black lettering on its side, along with a \"-30° + 30°\" graphic. The drone's perspective shifts, moving from a high-angle view to a position directly above the balloon, offering a close-up of its striped top as it glides over the wintery terrain.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to an extreme close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
