    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective, the snowboarder's arms and snowboard intermittently occupy the bottom of the frame in the immediate foreground. The scene is framed by two steep rock walls that extend from the foreground to the middle ground on the left and right sides, creating a narrow, central channel. In the background, centered between the walls, a sunlit, snow-covered mountain range is visible. The camera, positioned at the snowboarder's eye level, moves rapidly forward down the center of the channel. This movement causes the rock walls to rush past on either side, while snow is kicked up from the bottom of the frame, obscuring the immediate foreground. The distant mountain landscape in the center background gradually grows larger as the snowboarder descends.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person perspective, a snowboarder descends a narrow, snow-filled mountain couloir. The snowboarder's arms, clad in blue jacket sleeves and black gloves, are occasionally visible, as are their olive-green snow pants. The snowboard underfoot has blue and black graphics. The couloir is flanked by two steep, brown, rugged rock walls partially covered in snow.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a rapid descent down a narrow, steep, snow-filled couloir on a sunny day in a high-altitude mountain range. Towering, brown, jagged rock walls, partially covered in snow, flank the tight passage. Deep, powdery snow covers the ground, and a spray of white is kicked up by the movement. From this perspective, a pair of gloved hands in blue sleeves and a snowboard are sometimes visible at the bottom of the view. In the distance, at the end of the chute, a wider, sunlit, snow-covered mountain landscape can be seen under a clear blue sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
