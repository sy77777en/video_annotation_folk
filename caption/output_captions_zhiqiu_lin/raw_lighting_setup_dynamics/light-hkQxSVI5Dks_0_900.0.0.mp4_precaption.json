    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the **lighting setup and dynamics** in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of its **light sources, quality, and interaction with subjects**. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting. Your goal is to describe the **overall lighting characteristics** and any significant variations in a clear, natural paragraph. Avoid speculative statements like \"it appears\" or ambiguous options like \"A or B.\" Return only the description.  \n\nFirst, identify the **primary light sources** in the scene, specifying whether they are **natural (sunlight, moonlight, firelight), artificial (visible lamps, LEDs, off-camera studio lighting), or non-realistic (CGI, synthetic lighting)**. If the scene is indoors or outdoors, describe how the environment affects the lighting\u2014indoor light is often diffused by surface reflections, while outdoor sunlight is harsher on clear days and softer on overcast days. Mention any **notable changes in lighting sources**, such as a streetlamp turning on or firelight fading.  \n\nNext, describe the **lighting quality**, indicating whether it is **soft or hard**. If the quality varies across the scene, specify how different areas are affected, considering the distance and intensity of the light sources.  \n\nIf subjects are present, analyze how lighting interacts with them. Specify the **contrast ratio**\u2014whether it has **flat lighting (1:1\u20131:2), normal contrast (1:4\u20131:8), or high contrast (above 1:8)**. Describe the **light direction** in relation to the subject and camera, such as **front, back, side, top, bottom, or ambient light**. If distinct **lighting effects** are applied, mention them, such as **Portrait Lighting, Rembrandt Lighting, Silhouette Lighting, or Rim Light**. If the contrast or light direction shifts throughout the video, specify the **transition**.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of lighting setup. Please use these as references to expand your description. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting.\n\n**Scene Type:** The video is set in an outdoor environment.\n\n**Light Source(s):** Sunlight is a primary light source.\n\n**Sunlight Condition:** The video features regular daylight with balanced brightness, neither particularly hard nor soft.\n\n**Light Quality:** The light quality varies across the scene, making it difficult to categorize.\n\n**Light Contrast on Subject(s):** The subject is lit with high-key lighting. The lighting on the subject has minimal contrast ratio, creating a flat lighting effect (e.g., 1:1 to 1:2).\n\n**Light Direction(s) on Subject(s):** There is a noticeable light source consistently illuminating the subject from behind (backlighting), as seen from the camera\u2019s perspective. There is a noticeable light source consistently illuminating the subject from the top (top lighting), as seen from the camera\u2019s perspective. The subject is lit with ambient light, with soft illumination and no clearly dominant directional source.\n\n**Lighting Effects on Subject(s):** The lighting setup appears professionally done (e.g., portrait or stage lighting). Rim lighting creates a glowing edge around the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a shot of a tall building under a bright sky, suggesting a daytime setting with ample sunlight. The light is relatively soft, likely due to the cloud cover, which diffuses the sun's rays, creating a balanced exposure that avoids harsh shadows. As the camera transitions to a close-up of a man wearing a blue shirt, the lighting remains consistent, maintaining a soft quality that highlights his facial features without creating overly dramatic contrasts. The light appears to come from above and slightly to the front, creating subtle shadows that add depth to the image. The overall lighting setup is professional, with a focus on even illumination and minimal contrast, suitable for capturing the subject clearly and naturally. The transition between the wide shot of the building and the close-up of the man maintains a cohesive lighting scheme, ensuring that the subject remains well-lit and the details are preserved.",
