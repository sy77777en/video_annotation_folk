    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the color composition and dynamics in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of its **color type, temperature, saturation, brightness, and grading**. Your goal is to describe the **overall color characteristics** and any significant variations in a clear, natural paragraph. Avoid speculative statements like 'it appears' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **color type** by stating whether the video is black-and-white or colored. If colored, describe the dominant colors of **major subjects and scene elements** such as clothing, sky, water, trees, buildings, and vehicles. Highlight any **salient or unusual colors** that enhance visual appeal.\n\nNext, describe the **overall color temperature** as **warm, cool, or neutral**. If the video contains both warm and cool elements, describe their contrast. If temperature changes throughout the video, specify the **initial and final states**.\n\nThen, describe the **color saturation**, indicating whether it is **high, neutral, or low**. Mention any **contrasting saturation elements**, such as a highly saturated neon sign in a desaturated environment. If saturation changes, specify how colors transition over time.\n\nSpecify the **overall brightness level** as **very bright, bright, neutral, dark, or very dark**. If different areas of the scene contrast in brightness, describe this relationship. If brightness changes, specify the **transition**.\n\nFinally, describe any **color grading effects** that influence the video\u2019s temperature, saturation, or brightness. If a distinct grading style is present, such as a **teal-and-orange filter** or **monochrome desaturation**, include it.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of color composition. Please use these as references to expand your description.\n\n**Color Temperature:** The video has noticeable shifts between warm and cool color tones.\n\n**Color Saturation:** The color saturation is too complex to be described as black-and-white, high, low, neutral, transitions among them, or strong contrast between saturated and desaturated areas.\n\n**Brightness and Exposure:** The overall brightness of the video changes over time, with noticeable shifts between brighter and darker levels across large portions of the frame.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Make your paragraph concise and simple, including as many video details as possible, without mentioning what is not present.",
    "pre_caption": "This color video showcases blue-grey skyscrapers and older brick buildings against a very bright sky, with a character featured in a blue t-shirt. The color temperature shifts between cool tones, evident in the architectural shots and bright sky, and more neutral or subtly warm moments under direct sunlight, though an overall cool bias is maintained through grading. Color saturation is complex and generally subdued across the scene, affected by the intense brightness that washes out details, with the character's blue shirt offering a pocket of comparatively less muted color. The overall brightness level fluctuates, displaying significant shifts between very bright, overexposed highlights and potentially darker segments within the scene. A distinct color grading style influences the visuals, pushing the highlights towards white, maintaining a cool and somewhat desaturated look, and incorporating stylistic elements like lens flares.",
