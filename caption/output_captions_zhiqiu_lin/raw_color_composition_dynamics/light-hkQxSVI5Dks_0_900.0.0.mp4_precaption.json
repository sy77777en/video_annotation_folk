    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the color composition and dynamics in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of its **color type, temperature, saturation, brightness, and grading**. Your goal is to describe the **overall color characteristics** and any significant variations in a clear, natural paragraph. Avoid speculative statements like 'it appears' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **color type** by stating whether the video is black-and-white or colored. If colored, describe the dominant colors of **major subjects and scene elements** such as clothing, sky, water, trees, buildings, and vehicles. Highlight any **salient or unusual colors** that enhance visual appeal.\n\nNext, describe the **overall color temperature** as **warm, cool, or neutral**. If the video contains both warm and cool elements, describe their contrast. If temperature changes throughout the video, specify the **initial and final states**.\n\nThen, describe the **color saturation**, indicating whether it is **high, neutral, or low**. Mention any **contrasting saturation elements**, such as a highly saturated neon sign in a desaturated environment. If saturation changes, specify how colors transition over time.\n\nSpecify the **overall brightness level** as **very bright, bright, neutral, dark, or very dark**. If different areas of the scene contrast in brightness, describe this relationship. If brightness changes, specify the **transition**.\n\nFinally, describe any **color grading effects** that influence the video\u2019s temperature, saturation, or brightness. If a distinct grading style is present, such as a **teal-and-orange filter** or **monochrome desaturation**, include it.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of color composition. Please use these as references to expand your description.\n\n**Color Temperature:** The video has noticeable shifts between warm and cool color tones.\n\n**Color Saturation:** The color saturation is too complex to be described as black-and-white, high, low, neutral, transitions among them, or strong contrast between saturated and desaturated areas.\n\n**Brightness and Exposure:** The overall brightness of the video changes over time, with noticeable shifts between brighter and darker levels across large portions of the frame.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph.",
    "pre_caption": "This video is presented in color, featuring predominantly cool blues and greys in the architecture and the bright, overcast sky, with some contrast provided by the warmer tones of a brick building and the subject's skin. The overall color temperature shifts between cooler and warmer tones during the sequence. Color saturation appears generally subdued across the scene elements, creating a somewhat muted palette, though the blue of the subject's shirt remains clearly visible. The brightness level varies, with very bright, almost blown-out highlights in the sky contrasting with less intensely lit foreground elements, and noticeable shifts in overall exposure occur. A distinct color grading style contributes to the look, emphasizing cooler tones, controlled saturation, and bright highlights, lending a slightly stark, atmospheric quality to the urban visuals, enhanced by occasional lens flares.",
