    "pre_caption_prompt": "DESCRIBE the colors of the subjects and/or scene in this video in ONE PARAGRAPH ONLY. Your response MUST follow the rules below:\n\n1. DO NOT USE ANY NEGATIVE WORDS \u2014 this includes \u201cwithout\u201d, \u201cno\u201d, \u201cneither\u201d, or similar.\n2. FOLLOW our guidance below on color temperature, saturation, brightness, exposure, and grading.\n3. If anything is NEUTRAL or UNREMARKABLE, explain WHY \u2014 do NOT repeat the guidance.\n4. BE CONCISE, NATURAL, CLEAR, and OBJECTIVE.\n5. RETURN ONLY THE DESCRIPTION PARAGRAPH \u2014 DO NOT add any commentary or explanation.\n6. This is a color analysis task. DO NOT make assumptions or subjective judgments.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of color composition. Please use these as references to expand your description.\n\n**Color Temperature:** The video features a complex color usage that cannot be described as black-and-white, warm, cool, neutral, transitions among them, or warm\u2013cool contrasts.\n\n**Color Saturation:** The color saturation is too complex to be described as black-and-white, high, low, neutral, transitions among them, or strong contrast between saturated and desaturated areas.\n\n**Brightness and Exposure:** The brightness (or exposure) is too complex to be described as bright, neutral, dark, transitions among them, or strong contrast between bright and dark areas.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately.",
    "pre_caption": "The video displays a dramatic interplay of light and shadow across a landscape and sky. Luminous, fiery oranges, yellows, and bright whites dominate the central atmospheric phenomena and horizon light sources, casting strong rays. These intensely lit areas contrast sharply with the surrounding clouds, which exhibit deeper greys and browns, and the landscape below, rendered in dark greens, browns, and greys within deep shadows. The overall color temperature is intricate, arising from the juxtaposition of these varied hues, aligning with the guidance that it resists simple classification. Likewise, the color saturation presents complexity, with highly saturated light sources set against the more subdued tones of the shadows and darker clouds. The brightness and exposure are also complex, featuring extreme highlights in the sky alongside extensive dark, shadowed regions in the landscape and clouds, preventing a straightforward description as merely bright, dark, or neutral.",
