    "pre_caption": "The video features a wide shot of a street scene in a Japanese town. In the foreground, on the left side, a group of people, including a woman in a beige coat and a man in a black outfit, walk along the sidewalk. They are positioned in the middle ground as they move towards the background. On the right side, a red car drives past in the middle ground, while a black car is parked in the foreground. As the video progresses, another black car enters from the left and moves towards the background. The street is lined with traditional-style buildings, which are positioned in the background on both sides. The camera is at the height of the subjects, capturing the scene from a first-person perspective.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures a street scene with several people and vehicles. On the left, a group of people, including a woman in a beige coat and a man in a black outfit, walk along the sidewalk. They are joined by others dressed in casual attire, some carrying bags. A black car is parked on the right side of the street, while a red car drives past. Towards the end of the video, another black car enters the frame and drives up the street.  The street is lined with traditional-style buildings, adding a cultural element to the scene. The overall atmosphere is that of a busy, everyday street with people and cars moving through the area.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot, capturing a lively street scene in a quaint Japanese town. The setting is outdoors, with traditional wooden buildings lining both sides of the street, showcasing a blend of modern and classic architecture. The time of day is clear and sunny, with a bright blue sky and scattered clouds. The street is moderately busy, featuring pedestrians walking along the sidewalks and cars, including a red and a black vehicle, moving along the road. The environment is vibrant, with green foliage and colorful autumn leaves adding to the picturesque atmosphere. The scene conveys a sense of everyday life in a charming, culturally rich setting.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
