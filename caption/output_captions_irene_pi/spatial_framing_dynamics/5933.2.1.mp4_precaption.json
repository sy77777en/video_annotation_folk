    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a close-up shot focusing on tall, dry grass in the foreground, occupying most of the frame. The grass is positioned centrally in the 2D space and in the foreground in 3D, partially obscuring the view. As the scene progresses, the shot size remains a close-up, but the focus shifts slightly. A person wearing dark, knee-high rubber boots and light-colored pants enters the frame from the top, moving downward into the water. The boots appear in the lower part of the frame, near the bottom center in 2D and in the middle ground in 3D. The water is in the background, reflecting the sky. The camera maintains a level position relative to the subject, capturing the boots and the water as the primary elements. The grass continues to occupy the upper portion of the frame, gradually becoming less prominent as the boots and water become more central. The transition from the initial focus on the grass to the boots and water is smooth, emphasizing the interaction between the person and the environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a close-up of tall, dry grass, revealing a person walking through a shallow body of water. The person is wearing dark, knee-high rubber boots and light-colored pants. The boots create ripples in the water as they move, indicating the person's slow, deliberate pace. The grass initially obscures the view, but as the scene progresses, the focus shifts to the boots and the water, highlighting the interaction between the person and the natural environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor setting in a natural environment, likely a marsh or wetland area. The scene features tall, dry grasses with a golden-brown hue, their slender, textured stalks swaying gently. In the background, a body of water reflects the sky, suggesting a calm atmosphere. The time of day appears to be daytime, with clear skies and natural light illuminating the scene. The ground is wet, with visible water puddles, indicating recent rain or a naturally damp area. The presence of boots suggests human activity, with individuals walking through the shallow water, creating ripples. The overall scene conveys a serene, untouched landscape with subtle human interaction.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a close-up shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
