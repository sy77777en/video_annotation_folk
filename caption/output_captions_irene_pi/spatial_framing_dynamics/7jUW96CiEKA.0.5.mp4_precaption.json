One crocodile is positioned horizontally across the middle ground on the riverbank, extending from the center-left to the center-right of the frame, with its head near the water's edge. The head and upper back of a second crocodile are visible in the center-right foreground, partially submerged in the water. The riverbank occupies the upper portion of the frame in the middle ground and background, while the water fills the lower portion in the foreground. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two crocodiles near a riverbank. The first crocodile is on a sandy riverbank, appearing to crawl toward the river, with its snout clearly visible. The second crocodile is floating on the water's surface, its swimming motion creating gentle ripples that spread across the water. Both the crocodiles have rough, textured skin with a mix of gray and green hues, and distinct dark bands along their tails. Their bodies are elongated and muscular, with visible scales.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor scene at the edge of a body of murky water. A light brown, muddy bank slopes down to meet the water. Sparse, dry-looking vegetation is present on the bank. The first crocodile is on a sandy riverbank, seemingly crawling toward the river, with only its snout clearly visible. The second crocodile is floating on the water's surface, swimming. The water is not calm, as visible ripples disturb the surface. The scene occurs during daylight hours.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
