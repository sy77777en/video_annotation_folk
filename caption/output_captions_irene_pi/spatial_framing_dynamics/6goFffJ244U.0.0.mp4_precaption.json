    "pre_caption": "The video features an abstract scene with numerous circular light patterns resembling bokeh effects. These circles vary in size and intensity, displaying warm hues of gold, orange, and yellow. The lights are scattered across the frame, creating a sense of depth and movement. The circles are distributed throughout the frame, with some positioned in the foreground and others in the middle ground and background, contributing to a layered effect. The lights appear to float and overlap, with some moving slightly from left to right or top to bottom, enhancing the dynamic composition. The camera maintains a consistent height relative to the lights, capturing the scene from a straight-on perspective. The overall composition is visually rich, with the glowing circles providing a soft, radiant contrast against the dark backdrop.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features an abstract scene with numerous circular light patterns resembling bokeh effects. These circles vary in size and intensity, displaying warm hues of gold, orange, and yellow. The lights are scattered across the frame, creating a sense of depth and movement. The overall composition is dynamic, with the glowing circles appearing to float and overlap, contributing to a visually rich and textured appearance.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents an abstract scene with a dark background filled with numerous glowing, circular bokeh lights. These lights vary in size and are predominantly warm hues of gold and amber, creating a shimmering effect. The lights appear to float and gently shift, suggesting a sense of motion. The overall atmosphere is ambient and visually dynamic, with the lights providing a soft, radiant contrast against the dark backdrop.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
