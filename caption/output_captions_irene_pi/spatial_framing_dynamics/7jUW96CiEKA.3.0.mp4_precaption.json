    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide shot of a landscape. The foreground, occupying the bottom portion of the frame, consists of sandy ground with sparse vegetation and faint tracks. Stretching across the middle ground is a wide expanse of flat, dry terrain. In the background, a line of trees runs horizontally across the frame, positioned below the sky which fills the top half of the frame and features clouds with patches of blue. The camera is positioned low to the ground, looking across the landscape towards the horizon. The shot remains static throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a landscape scenery shot. It captures a vast, open expanse of dry, sandy terrain with sparse vegetation, under a sky filled with a mix of clouds and patches of blue. The focus is on the expansive environment, emphasizing the scale and atmosphere of the scene rather than any specific object. The distant tree line and the wide, open sky contribute to the sense of vastness and tranquility.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video displays a wide, outdoor landscape under a cloudy daytime sky. The foreground consists of flat, light-brown sandy ground sparsely covered with small green plants and marked by faint tracks. In the distance, a horizontal line of green trees separates the ground from the sky, which is filled with predominantly white and grey clouds, with some areas of blue visible.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
