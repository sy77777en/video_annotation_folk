    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a wide shot of an empty, narrow, green train corridor. Initially, there are no subjects in view, focusing on the corridor's length and details such as the patterned floor and windows on the right side. The camera remains stationary at the subject's level. As the video progresses, a door near the far end of the corridor opens, revealing two men entering from the background. They begin walking towards the camera, gradually moving from the background into the middle ground. The first man, carrying a wrapped object resembling a tree, is slightly ahead on the left side of the frame, while the second man, holding a white object, follows closely behind on the right. Both men are centered horizontally as they approach. By the end of the video, they are closer to the camera, filling more of the frame and becoming the primary focus. The camera maintains its position throughout, capturing the men's movement along the corridor without any change in angle or height. The spatial dynamics highlight the transition from an empty corridor to one occupied by the two men as they walk forward.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with an empty narrow, green train corridor. A door opens, and two men enter the frame. The first man is wearing a green cap, green pants, a white short-sleeved shirt with a tie, and a dark green vest. He carries a wrapped object that resembles a tree. The second man is dressed in a dark coat, green pants, a white shirt with a tie, and a Santa hat. He holds a white object, the nature of which is unclear. The corridor features a patterned floor and windows on the right side, enhancing the vintage train ambiance. As the men move closer to the camera, their attire and the objects they carry become more visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts the interior of a vintage train carriage with a long, narrow corridor. The setting is indoors, characterized by pale green walls and a matching ceiling with subtle, curved lines. The floor features a patterned design with alternating shapes, adding texture to the scene. Large windows line one side of the corridor, allowing natural light to filter in, suggesting daytime. The train's interior has a retro aesthetic, with doors and panels that have a metallic finish. The scene includes individuals moving through the corridor, adding a sense of motion and activity within the confined space.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a wide shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
