Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video.

#### 1. Subject Type  
1. Identify the subject's type precisely.  
   - **Examples:**  
     1. "man," "woman," "dog," "car," "tree."  
     2. Avoid vague terms like "thing" or "item."  
2. If the subject type is ambiguous, provide your best judgment and explain your reasoning.  

#### 2. Visual Attributes  
1. Describe the subject's key visual characteristics using specific and descriptive language.  
2. Consider the following aspects where relevant:  

   - **Appearance:**  
     1. **People:** Include details like clothing (colors and style), hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression.  
     2. **Objects:** Describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing marks (e.g., "smooth," "rough," "furry," "metallic," "black," "red," etc.).  

   - **Pose/Orientation:**  
     1. Describe the subject's posture and orientation within the frame (e.g., "standing," "sitting," "lying down," "walking," "facing left," "arms raised," "facing the camera").  
     2. Pay particular attention to objects not in their usual state (e.g., a tilted lamp, a book lying open face down).  

#### 3. How to Refer to Multiple Subjects  
1. When there is more than one important person or object, make sure it's clear which one you are referring to.  
2. Use the following strategies for clarity:  

   - **Type:** The simplest way to refer to a subject is by its category, e.g., “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.”  
   - **Attributes:** If multiple subjects belong to the same category, use distinguishing features:  

     1. **Unique Appearance:** Highlight distinct traits, such as "the woman in the red dress," "the man with the beard," "the blue car," or "the largest tree."  
     2. **Location:** Specify position within the scene, e.g., "the man on the left," "the dog in the background," "the car in the midground," or "the building in the middle."  
     3. **Action:** Describe their activity, e.g., "the person walking," "the child playing with a ball," "the bird flying," or "the cat sitting on the windowsill."  
     4. **Relationship to Each Other:** For example, "the man next to the woman" (spatial relationship), “the first man that enters the frame” (temporal relationship), or "the two cars parked side by side."  

   - **Combining Descriptions:** For maximum clarity, combine multiple attributes.  
     - **Example:**  
       1. "The woman in the red dress on the left, talking on her phone."  
       2. "The dog in the background, running toward the ball."  

3. The key is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily tell which subject you are referring to.  

#### 4. Order Matters When Describing Multiple Subjects  
1. When describing multiple subjects, the order in which you mention them matters. Prioritize elements based on their importance in the video.  
2. Follow these guidelines:  

   - **Temporal Order:** If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear.  
     - **Example:** "First, the car speeds past, then the cyclist enters the frame."  
   - **Prominence-Based Order:** If temporal order isn’t relevant, start with the most visually striking or important subject before moving on to less prominent ones.  
     - **Example:** "The video shows a bright red sports car in the foreground. In the midground, a blue sedan is right behind it."  

#### 5. If the Video Contains Multiple Subjects or Complex Subject Transitions  
1. **Determine the Primary Focus:**  

   - If there is a single clear main subject:  
     1. Describe the main subject in detail, explaining why this subject is the focus while others are not.  
     2. Include relevant details such as appearance, actions, and positioning that make the subject stand out.  
     3. Provide a less detailed overview of secondary subjects, mentioning only their general presence or relationship to the main subject.  

   - If the main subject is unclear:  
     1. Describe subjects in prominence-based order (e.g., humans before objects).  

   - If there is no clear main subject:  
     1. Give a brief overview of all subjects without excessive detail.  

2. **Identify Subject Transitions:**  

   - If the focus shifts between subjects, specify the type of transition:  
     1. **Subject Revealing:** A new subject enters the frame.  
     2. **Subject Disappearing:** A subject exits or is no longer visible.  
     3. **Subject Switching:** The focus shifts from one subject to another through rack focus or other camera movements.  
     4. **Other Complex Changes:** Subjects alternate focus multiple times.  

   - Explain how the transition occurs (through subject movement or camera movement).  

Following these steps ensures a more fluent and coherent subject description. In cases of subject switching, always describe subjects in **temporal order** for clarity.
