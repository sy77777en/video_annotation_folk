### **Color Composition and Dynamics**  
Provide a concise yet informative description of the color composition and dynamics in the video, considering key elements like color temperature, saturation, brightness, and grading.

#### **1. Color Type**  
1. Indicate if the video is black-and-white or colored.  
2. Describe the colors of major subjects and scene elements:  
   - **Examples:**

3. Describe saturation changes over time.  
   - **Examples:**  
     - "Vibrant colors gradually fade into desaturated tones, creating a somber atmosphere."
