Provide a concise yet informative description of the lighting setup and dynamics in the video, considering key elements including (1) light sources, (2) light quality, and (3) how lighting interacts with the subject(s) (e.g., contrast ratio, light direction), if subjects are present.  

#### **1. Lighting Setup / Sources**  
1. Identify the major light source(s) in the scene:  
   - **Natural sources:** Sunlight, moonlight, firelight, and others.  
   - **Artificial sources:** Practical lighting (e.g., visible lamps, LEDs) or non-visible lights (e.g., off-camera studio lighting).  
   - **Non-realistic lighting:** If the video features anime, CGI, or synthetic lighting without physically accurate illumination, clearly indicate this.  
2. Specify the scene setup (indoor, outdoor, or weather conditions) as it affects lighting.  
   - **Examples:**  
     - Indoor light often softens due to surface reflections.  
     - Outdoor sunlight is harsh on clear days and diffused on overcast days.  
3. Mention changes in the lighting setup and sources.  
   - **Examples:**  
     - "A streetlamp turns on."  
     - "The scene darkens as firelight fades."  

#### **2. Lighting Quality**  
1. Describe the overall light quality (**soft or hard**) if it is clear and consistent across the scene.  
2. Note that light quality depends on the distance between the scene and the light sources.  
3. If the light quality varies, specify the differences across different parts of the scene.  

#### **3. Lighting on Subjects (if Subjects are Present)**  
1. Determine how much brighter the lit areas are compared to the shadowed areas on the subject.  
   - **Contrast Ratios:**  
     - **Flat Lighting:** (1:1–1:2)  
     - **Normal Contrast:** (1:4–1:8)  
     - **High Contrast:** (Above 1:8)  
2. Mention any significant changes in the light contrast ratio.  
3. Describe where the dominant light source is coming from relative to both the subject and camera.  
   - **Examples:**  
     - **Back Light**  
     - **Front Light**  
     - **Side Light**  
     - **Top Light**  
     - **Bottom Light**  
     - **Ambient Light**  
4. Identify distinct lighting effects applied to the subject.  
   - **Examples:**  
     - **Portrait Lighting**  
     - **Rembrandt Lighting**  
     - **Silhouette Lighting**  
     - **Rim Light**
