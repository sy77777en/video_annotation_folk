How are subjects and elements framed? Where are they positioned? How do they move?

Describe shot size (close-up, medium, wide), subject position within the frame (left, right, center), and depth (foreground, midground, background). If subjects or elements move, describe how framing changesâ€”whether they shift positions, move toward or away from the camera, or if the camera itself moves (e.g., tilts, pans, zooms). Keep it clear and sequential.
