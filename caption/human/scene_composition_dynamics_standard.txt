Where is the scene? What does it look like? How is it captured?

Describe the setting conciselyâ€”indoor or outdoor, notable landmarks, time of day, and key visual elements. Mention weather, architecture, or props if relevant. If motion or transitions occur, describe them in order. Specify the camera perspective (e.g., drone shot, first-person) if it affects how the scene is perceived. Keep it clear and structured.
