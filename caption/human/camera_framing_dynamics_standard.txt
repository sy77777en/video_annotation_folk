How is the video captured? How does the camera move?

Describe video speed (normal, slow-motion, time-lapse, etc.), lens distortion (fisheye, barrel), and camera height (eye-level, overhead, ground-level). Note the camera angle (high, low, level) and if a Dutch tilt is present. If focus is relevant, state whether itâ€™s deep or shallow and if it shifts (rack focus). For movement, specify translation (dolly, truck, crane) or rotation (pan, tilt, roll), including intensity and steadiness. Keep descriptions sequential and clear.
