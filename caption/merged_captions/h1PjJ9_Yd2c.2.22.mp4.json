  "merged_caption": "In the foreground, slightly left of center, a woman with long, dark hair tied back in a ponytail is seen from behind as she walks down a narrow and dimly lit indoor hallway. She is wearing a grey, short-sleeved t-shirt. The corridor features plain, light-colored walls and several closed doors. The camera, from an eye-level, level-angle perspective, follows her with a slightly unsteady handheld motion, maintaining a shallow depth of field with the focus on her in the foreground. As she progresses through the corridor, the camera moves forward and pans slightly to the left, keeping her centered in the frame. A bright light source at the far end of the hall creates a stark backlight, rendering her figure as a dark silhouette. As she reaches a door on the left wall, she extends her left hand to grasp the handle and begins to open it. Throughout the video, she consistently remains in the foreground, silhouetted by the bright light at the far end of the corridor.",

    "Subject": "A woman with long, dark hair tied back in a ponytail is seen from behind. She is wearing a grey, short-sleeved t-shirt. The scene is dimly lit, and for much of the video, she is silhouetted as she walks down a narrow hallway.",
    "Motion": "A woman, viewed from behind, walks down a dimly lit hallway. As she proceeds, she extends her left hand, grasps the doorknob of a door on the left wall, and begins to open it.",
    "Scene": "A woman with long hair, seen from behind, walks down a narrow and dimly lit indoor hallway. The corridor features plain, light-colored walls and several closed doors. A bright light source at the far end of the hall creates a stark backlight, rendering her figure as a dark silhouette. The camera follows her as she moves away, down the length of the corridor.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
