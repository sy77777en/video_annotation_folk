  "merged_caption": "This scenery video begins with an extreme wide shot of the Notre-Dame Cathedral, captured from a low angle. The cathedral is centrally positioned in the frame, extending from the middle ground to the background. In the middle ground, a large, illuminated Christmas tree is located in the bottom-center-left, with other buildings to its left and people scattered across the bottom of the frame. Ornate street lamps are visible from the foreground to the background on the right. The camera, positioned at a low-angle, eye-level, moves forward while tilting up to capture the full height of the cathedral, transitioning the scene into a wide shot. This movement brings the cathedral's facade closer, causing it to fill more of the frame while remaining centered. Consequently, the Christmas tree shifts into the foreground on the left, and the street lamps are pushed further toward the right edge. The Gothic stone building, featuring two prominent towers and a large central rose window, is brightly lit against the dark sky. The grand Gothic structure, with its two iconic towers and large rose window, is brilliantly illuminated against a dark, moody sky. The entire scene is framed by black letterbox bars at the top and bottom, with a white text overlay in the bottom right corner displaying \"MATHIEU STANIĆ\" with \"CINEMATOGRAPHER\" appearing underneath. The focus is not on a single subject but rather on the overall atmosphere and scale of the environment, using the interplay of architectural grandeur and festive lighting to create a powerful sense of place and occasion.",

The grand Gothic structure, with its two iconic towers and large rose window, is brilliantly illuminated against a dark, moody sky. Initially appearing in the middleground, a large Christmas tree, densely wrapped in glowing blue and white lights, gradually transitions to the foreground as the camera moves, enhancing the dynamic composition of the scene. The focus is not on a single subject but rather on the overall atmosphere and scale of the environment, using the interplay of architectural grandeur and festive lighting to create a powerful sense of place and occasion.",
    "Motion": "This video is a scenic night shot of the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, with a large, illuminated Christmas tree initially in the middleground and gradually moving to the foreground as the camera advances.

    "Scene": "A nighttime shot slowly zooms in on the illuminated facade of the Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris. The Gothic stone building, featuring two prominent towers and a large central rose window, is brightly lit against the dark sky. In front of the cathedral's entrance stands a large, cone-shaped Christmas tree adorned with bright blue lights. In the plaza, people are visible, and to the right, ornate, multi-globed street lamps cast a white light. The scene is framed by black letterbox bars at the top and bottom, and a white text overlay in the bottom right corner displays \"MATHIEU STANIĆ\" with \"CINEMATOGRAPHER\" appearing underneath.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
