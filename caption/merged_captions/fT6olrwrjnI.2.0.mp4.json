  "merged_caption": "In a high-angle medium shot, two young men are positioned on a brightly lit soccer field with vibrant green turf marked by a thick white line running horizontally across the frame. The player with messy white hair and fair skin is on the left side of the frame, wearing a white sleeveless jersey with the number \"7\" in black, accented with black and blue details, over a black long-sleeved undershirt. He is looking over his left shoulder. Slightly to the right and behind him is another young man with black, spiky hair and fair skin, wearing a red sleeveless jersey with the number \"18\" in black, also over a black long-sleeved undershirt. Both jerseys feature a small, triangular yellow and green logo on the chest. The man in the red jersey stands closely behind the first in a defensive posture. The scene is static, with neither individual moving, but the camera smoothly shifts upward and slightly to the left, towards the upper left corner of the frame, maintaining the players' athletic stances.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
