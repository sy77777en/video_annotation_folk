  "merged_caption": "This is a wide shot of a coastal scene with a subtle, gradual upward camera movement. A large, dark rock with patches of yellow lichen is positioned in the right foreground, framing the view. The middle ground is occupied by the dark, choppy sea, with several smaller rocks covered in green seaweed visible from the bottom left to the center. Gentle waves create movement on the ocean's surface. In the background, a large, light-colored, dome-shaped island sits on the horizon, slightly to the right of the frame's center, beneath a cloudy, overcast sky filled with grey and white clouds. The camera performs a minor, slow pedestal up movement, maintaining a very smooth, level-angle shot with deep focus, keeping both the foreground rocks and the distant island in sharp detail. The static composition emphasizes the rugged texture of the rocks, the vastness of the water, and the imposing presence of the distant island. The video lacks a distinct main subject; instead, the focus is on the overall atmosphere and the grand scale of the natural environment.",

    "Subject": "This is a coastal scenery shot that presents a layered view of the sea from a rocky shoreline. A large, dark rock with patches of yellow lichen dominates the right foreground, creating a natural frame for the scene beyond. The midground features the dark, choppy sea, with several smaller, seaweed-covered rocks breaking the surface. In the distance, a prominent, pale, dome-shaped island sits on the horizon beneath a cloudy, overcast sky. The video lacks a distinct main subject; instead, the focus is on the overall atmosphere and the grand scale of the natural environment. The static composition emphasizes the rugged texture of the rocks, the vastness of the water, and the imposing presence of the distant island.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenic shot of a rocky coastline looking out to sea, where gentle waves create movement on the ocean's surface. A large, prominent island is visible in the distance under a cloudy sky. The foreground is dominated by a large rock with patches of yellow lichen.",
    "Scene": "From a rocky shoreline, the view extends across a body of dark blue water toward the horizon. In the foreground, a large, dark brown rock with patches of yellow lichen is prominent on the right. Just offshore, several smaller rocks covered in green seaweed emerge from the gently moving water. In the distance, a large, light-colored, dome-shaped island is visible under an overcast sky filled with grey and white clouds.",
    "Spatial": "This is a wide shot of a coastal scene with a subtle, gradual upward camera movement. A large rock is positioned in the right foreground, framing the view. The middle ground is occupied by the sea, with several smaller rocks visible from the bottom left to the center. In the background, a large, dome-shaped island sits on the horizon, slightly to the right of the frame's center, beneath a cloudy sky that fills the top portion of the scene."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
