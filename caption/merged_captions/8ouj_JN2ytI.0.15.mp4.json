  "merged_caption": "In a medium close-up shot, a football player is positioned in the right side of the frame, shown from the back and his left side. He stands in the foreground on a football field that occupies the bottom of the frame. The player wears a white jersey with blue sleeves and green stripes on the shoulders, with the name \"RAVENSTAH\" partially visible in blue letters across the back. The jersey number appears to be \"10,\" though it is not fully clear and could be a number like \"18.\" He has on a blue helmet with a white facemask and a green and white logo on the side that includes the letters \"BCM.\" In the middle ground, two other players are partially obscured by the player in the foreground, with one player having the number \"54\" clearly visible on the front of his jersey. In the background, a large, out-of-focus crowd fills the stadium stands, predominantly wearing yellow. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, maintaining a smooth, eye-level shot with a shallow depth of field that keeps the focus on the football player in the foreground. The player briefly raises his right arm and shifts to the center as the camera moves slightly left to right while tilting up and arcing counterclockwise around the player. The green grass of the field is marked with white lines, and the scene is set in an outdoor football stadium during a daytime game.",

    "Subject": "A man, a football player, is seen from the back and side standing on a football field. He wears a white jersey with blue sleeves and green stripes on the shoulders. The name \"RAVENSTAH\" is partially visible in blue letters across the back, and the jersey number appears to be \"10,\" though it is not fully clear and could be a number like \"18.\" He has on a blue helmet with a white facemask and a green and white logo on the side that includes the letters \"BCM.\" He briefly raises his right arm. In the background, a large crowd of spectators, mostly wearing yellow, is visible in the stadium stands. Additionally, a few more football players wearing the same blue and white uniforms are on the field, with one player having the number \"54\" clearly visible on the front of his jersey.",
    "Motion": "A football player stands on a field with his back mostly to the camera and briefly raises his right arm.",
    "Scene": "An outdoor football stadium is seen during a daytime game from a perspective on the field. In the foreground, a football player is shown from behind, wearing a white jersey with blue and green trim. The name on the jersey appears to be \"RAVENSTAH,\" but it is partially obscured, and only part of the number is visible, making it unclear if it is \"10.\" His helmet is blue with a white facemask and a green and white logo. The green grass of the field is marked with white lines. In the background, the stadium stands are filled with a large, out-of-focus crowd predominantly wearing yellow.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
