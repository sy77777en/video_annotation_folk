  "merged_caption": "This video is an extreme wide shot of a desert landscape, with the scenery itself serving as the subject. The foreground and lower third of the frame are composed of sandy terrain and sparse vegetation, stretching from the bottom left to the bottom right. A light-colored dirt road enters from the bottom left and extends towards the right middle ground, which is filled with rolling sand dunes and more scrubland. The background is dominated by the sky, which occupies the upper two-thirds of the frame above a low horizon line. The primary dynamic element is a massive cloud formation in the top and center of the frame, which transitions in color from orange to pink and then purple in a time-lapse sequence. The camera, positioned at a level, eye-level height, performs a slow and smooth pan from left to right, capturing the desert landscape transitioning from a dramatic, cloudy sky with warm tones to a serene, twilight scene with soft purples and blues. Initially, the clouds are illuminated in fiery oranges and yellows by the setting sun, with a lumpy, textured appearance on one side and wispy streaks on the other, set against a patch of clear blue sky. As the sequence progresses, the light fades, and the clouds transform into vibrant shades of pink and magenta, eventually deepening into rich purples as twilight descends and the upper sky turns a clear, dark blue. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire scene from the foreground sand to the distant clouds in sharp detail, capturing the immense and dynamic beauty of the natural world itself.",

    "Camera": "This is a time-lapse video of a dramatic sky over a desert landscape. The camera, positioned at a level, eye-level height, performs a slow and smooth pan from left to right. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire scene from the foreground sand to the distant clouds in sharp detail.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a dramatic landscape scenery shot, focusing on the vast scale of a desert environment and the atmospheric spectacle above it, rather than a singular main subject. The focus is on capturing the immense and dynamic beauty of the natural world itself. The scene is set across a wide expanse of rolling sand dunes dotted with sparse, low-lying green scrub. Dominating the view is a breathtaking timelapse of the sky, where a massive formation of textured mammatus clouds undergoes a spectacular color transformation. Initially illuminated in fiery oranges and yellows by the setting sun, the clouds shift into brilliant shades of pink and magenta, eventually deepening into rich purples as twilight descends and the upper sky turns a clear, dark blue.",
    "Motion": "The video captures a desert landscape transitioning from a dramatic, cloudy sky with warm tones to a serene, twilight scene with soft purples and blues. The clouds create a dynamic and textured backdrop over the sandy terrain.",
    "Scene": "This time-lapse video captures a vast desert landscape under a dramatic, changing sky. The scene features rolling sand dunes and sparse, low-lying green and brown vegetation. A light-colored dirt road winds through the sandy terrain. Above, the sky is filled with a massive formation of clouds. Initially, these clouds are illuminated in shades of orange and gold, with a lumpy, textured appearance on one side and wispy streaks on the other, set against a patch of clear blue sky. As the sequence progresses, the light fades, and the clouds transform into vibrant shades of pink and purple, creating a colorful sunset display over the expansive desert.",
    "Spatial": "This video is an extreme wide shot of a desert landscape, with the scenery itself serving as the subject.

The primary dynamic element is a massive cloud formation in the top and center of the frame, which transitions in color from orange to pink and then purple in a time-lapse sequence. The camera is panning from left to right and is positioned at eye level, looking straight out towards the horizon. The bottom background also features an expansive stretch of sandy terrain and sparse vegetation."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
