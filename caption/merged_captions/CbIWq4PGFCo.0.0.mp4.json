  "merged_caption": "A close-up shot frames the back of a man's head and shoulders, positioned in the center foreground. The man, with short, dark brown, slightly messy hair, is wearing a black t-shirt and is looking away from the viewer with his head slightly tilted downwards, revealing his light-toned skin on his neck and ears. He remains completely still throughout the video. The scene overlooks a vast, arid plain that extends into the background, with a distant range of hazy, purple-hued mountains visible at the top of the frame under a pale sky, contributing to the desolate and expansive feel of the environment. The ground is rocky and sparsely vegetated. The camera, from a level, eye-level perspective, employs an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing sharply on the man in the foreground. It executes a slow and smooth counterclockwise arc around him, maintaining the subject's level throughout the shot, while the vast landscape in the background remains out of focus.",

    "Scene": "From a viewpoint positioned behind a person in a black shirt, the scene overlooks a vast, arid landscape at either dawn or dusk. A wide, barren plain stretches toward a distant range of hazy, purple-hued mountains under a pale sky. The ground is rocky and sparsely vegetated, contributing to the desolate and expansive feel of the environment.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
