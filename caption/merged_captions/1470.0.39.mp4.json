  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a person with short, slightly wavy brown hair, wearing a white short-sleeved shirt and a dark striped tie, holding a book titled 'Virginia's Chronicles.' They are facing to the right, positioned in the center of the frame, in an indoor setting with light-colored walls and a window with sheer curtains that allow soft, natural light to filter in, creating a gentle glow. The window, framed by a yellow border, is slightly left of center, while a green basket with towels is in the lower right corner. The yellow door frames are on both sides of the room, with the left door frame in the middle ground and the right door frame starting in the foreground. The camera is at eye level, looking straight ahead, and then transitions to a low angle, looking up at the person. As the camera zooms in, the subject moves into the foreground, transitioning to a medium close-up while maintaining their central position. The camera smoothly moves forward, slightly tilting up to focus on the person's face, with a gentle counter-clockwise roll. The person begins to turn their body to the right, gradually shifting their gaze forward, their head slightly tilted as it rotates counterclockwise in place, while maintaining their smile and speaking. The camera uses deep focus, keeping all elements sharp, and remains at the subject's level throughout, capturing their movements smoothly. The right door frame moves out of the frame as the camera zooms in, emphasizing the subject's presence in the scene. The setting suggests a warm, inviting atmosphere, with the overall scene being calm and well-lit, focusing on the interior's simple yet welcoming decor.",

The overall scene is calm and well-lit, with a focus on the interior's simple yet welcoming decor.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium shot of the subject, who is facing to the right, positioned in the center of the frame. As the camera zooms in, the subject moves into the foreground, transitioning to a medium close-up while maintaining their central position. The subject then turns to face the camera, revealing their face and upper body more prominently. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout, capturing their movements smoothly. In the background, the yellow-framed window is slightly left of center, and the green basket with patterned towels is in the lower right corner.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
