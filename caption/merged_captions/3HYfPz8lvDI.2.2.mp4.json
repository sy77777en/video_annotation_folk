  "merged_caption": "The video clip begins as a wide shot, captured from a high angle above the subject, and remains static initially. A wooden lounge chair with white, segmented cushioning is centrally positioned in the middle ground. It rests on a light gray, textured concrete pool deck that occupies the majority of the frame, also in the middle ground. Portions of a swimming pool, featuring clear blue water and mosaic-tiled edges, are visible in the bottom left, bottom right, and along the left edge of the frame, bordering the deck in the middle ground. The chair casts a distinct shadow towards the top left on the deck, indicating bright sunlight. The camera is positioned at an overhead level and uses a high angle, looking down. It employs deep focus, keeping a large depth of field. The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking as it zooms in on the lounge chair, transitioning to a full shot. The video captures a stationary wooden lounge chair with white, quilted cushioning placed on a light gray, textured surface adjacent to a swimming pool. The pool's edge is adorned with small, square, blue and white mosaic tiles, and the chair remains in the same position throughout the frames.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
