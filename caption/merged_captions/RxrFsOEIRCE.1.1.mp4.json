  "merged_caption": "This scenery shot begins with an extreme wide shot of a rural landscape, with no single main subject. A vast green field occupies the foreground and middle ground, extending from the bottom of the frame. In the background, a village is positioned on a gentle slope in the top left, while a dense forest is located in the middle ground on the right. The video is captured from the perspective of a fast-moving drone, starting at an aerial height with a high angle, looking down on the green landscape. The drone flies forward quickly while simultaneously descending and tilting up, transitioning the camera to an eye-level, level-angle perspective as it flies low over the field. The motion is slightly unsteady, and a deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp, although some barrel distortion is noticeable throughout the video. The rapid forward motion creates a significant blur, particularly at the edges of the view, emphasizing the exhilarating speed of the journey. As the camera advances, the shot transitions to a wide shot as it enters a narrow passage. In this final framing, the view is flanked by the forest on the right and other trees on the left, both now in the foreground and middle ground, with the path ahead centered in the frame. The focus shifts to the intricate details of tree branches and leaves, beautifully illuminated by sunlight filtering through. The sky is blue with a few scattered white clouds and a bright sun causing some lens flare. The camera remains at a low height relative to the ground throughout the shot, capturing the immersive experience of movement through the vibrant, sunlit rural countryside.",

    "Subject": "This is a landscape scenery shot capturing a fast-paced, low-altitude flight over a vibrant, sunlit rural countryside. The view begins above rolling green fields and transitions into a narrow passage flanked by trees on both sides, bordered on one side by a dense forest and on the other by scattered trees leading up to a small village nestled on a distant hill under a bright blue sky. The rapid forward motion creates a significant blur, particularly at the edges of the view, which emphasizes the exhilarating speed of the journey. This focus on the immersive experience of movement through the environment means there is no single main subject; instead, the atmosphere of a swift flight across the expansive, verdant landscape takes precedence.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenery shot of a vibrant, rural landscape on a sunny day. The view is across lush green fields, with a dense line of trees to the right and a small village in the distance. The drone begins its flight path by moving forward from above the green field, then transitions into a narrow passage bordered by trees on both sides, creating a significant motion blur effect.",
    "Scene": "The video begins with a drone flying at high speed over a vast, green field on a bright, sunny day, creating a motion blur on the grass and scattered trees. As the drone progresses, it transitions into a narrow forest passage, where the focus shifts to the intricate details of tree branches and leaves, beautifully illuminated by sunlight filtering through. In the background, a small village with houses sits on a gentle hill, and to the right, a dense line of leafy green trees borders the field. The sky is blue with a few scattered white clouds and a bright sun causing some lens flare.",
    "Spatial": "This scenery shot begins with an extreme wide shot of a rural landscape, with no single main subject. A vast green field occupies the foreground and middle ground, extending from the bottom of the frame. In the background, a village is positioned on a gentle slope in the top left, while a dense forest is located in the middle ground on the right. The camera moves forward at a very low altitude, creating significant motion blur on the fields in the foreground and the scattered trees in the left middle ground. As the camera advances, the shot transitions to a wide shot as it enters a narrow passage. In this final framing, the view is flanked by the forest on the right and other trees on the left, both now in the foreground and middle ground, with the path ahead centered in the frame. The camera remains at a low height relative to the ground throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
