  "merged_caption": "This video captures a wide shot of a city street, likely in the French Quarter of New Orleans, on an overcast, foggy day. A large white pickup truck occupies the bottom-left foreground, with a line of cars, including a black sports car and a police car with red and blue lights flashing near its headlights, stretching behind it into the left middle ground and continuing into the background. The street runs through the center of the frame, receding into the foggy distance. On both the left and right, historic buildings with prominent wrought-iron balconies and support columns frame the scene from the foreground to the middle ground, with balconies over a sidewalk on the left side as well. A covered sidewalk with support columns extends along the right side of the frame, where several flags hang in the top-right middle ground. A pedestrian is visible walking in the right middle ground, adding life to the scene. The camera is positioned at eye level, maintaining a deep focus to ensure the entire street scene, from the foreground truck to the buildings in the distance, remains sharp and clear. The camera remains mostly steady, though there is slight shaking, suggesting it is handheld, providing a dynamic perspective on the scenery. The scene includes subtle movements: flags gently wave in the wind, and the pedestrian walks to the right in the background. The buildings feature characteristic wrought-iron balconies with hanging plants, enhancing the unique architectural environment and the quiet, atmospheric quality of the overcast, foggy scene. The camera stays in the same general area, capturing the street flanked by sidewalks and columns, which recedes into the fog where the pedestrian is visible walking in the background.",

    "Camera": "This is a shot taken from an eye-level height and level angle perspective. The camera maintains a deep focus, ensuring that the entire street scene, from the foreground truck to the buildings in the distance, remains sharp and clear. While the camera stays in the same general area, it exhibits a slight wobble, suggesting it is handheld.",
    "Subject": "This cityscape scenery shot captures a quiet, wet street in what appears to be the French Quarter of New Orleans. On the left, a large, white, lifted pickup truck is parked in the foreground, followed by a line of other cars, including a black sports car and a parked police car with red and blue lights flashing near its headlights. The buildings feature characteristic wrought-iron balconies with hanging plants, while on the right, a pedestrian walks towards the covered sidewalk, adding life to the scene. Flags hang from poles along the sidewalk, enhancing the unique architectural environment and the quiet, atmospheric quality of the overcast, foggy scene.",
    "Motion": "This video captures a street scene, likely in the French Quarter of New Orleans, on an overcast day. The camera remains mostly steady, though there is slight shaking. The scene includes subtle movements: flags gently wave in the wind, red and blue lights flash from beneath the headlights of two police vehicles on the left side of the street, and a pedestrian walks to the right in the background.",
    "Scene": "On a foggy, overcast day, a narrow, wet street is lined with historic buildings featuring prominent wrought-iron balconies and support columns. A large, white, lifted pickup truck is parked on the left side of the road, with a black sports car and other vehicles queued behind it along the curb. On the right, several flags hang from the second-story balcony of a building with a sign for a gallery. The street, flanked by sidewalks and columns, recedes into the fog where a single pedestrian is visible walking in the background.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
