  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot, focusing on the rear section of a sleek, black vehicle's roof, positioned centrally within the frame. A tall antenna is prominently centered in the foreground, with a dome-shaped device situated slightly behind it in the center-right middle ground. Another tall antenna is partially visible in the top right middle ground. A translucent blue ring emanates from the foreground antenna, suggesting the activation of a radar or sensor system. The shot then transitions smoothly outwards to a full shot, revealing the entire roof of the vehicle, which remains centered. In this wider view, two tall antennas are visible around the center middle ground, accompanied by two dome devices also in the middle ground. The blue rings now emanate from both tall antennas, expanding across the roof surface. The camera, positioned directly above the vehicle, smoothly tracks it from above, trucking leftward while arcing counterclockwise around it. As the camera moves upward, the car becomes smaller in the frame, maintaining a steady and smooth motion throughout. The vehicle is shown driving on a paved road with white painted lines, resembling a crosswalk, under clear daylight conditions. The road appears blurred due to the vehicle's movement. The vehicle's roof is glossy black and reflects sunlight, emphasizing its modern design with smooth lines and a streamlined shape. The video concludes with a wider view of the vehicle, showing the blue circular wave fully formed around the roof, with the road and crosswalks in the background. The advanced technology on the roof, including the antennas and dome-shaped structures, likely serves as sensors or communication equipment, highlighting the vehicle's technological sophistication.",

    "Camera": "The video features an overhead camera at a high angle, maintaining deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera smoothly tracks a car from above, trucking leftward while arcing counterclockwise around it. As the camera moves upward, the car becomes smaller in the frame, maintaining a steady and smooth motion throughout.",
    "Subject": "The video features a sleek, black vehicle with a glossy finish, prominently displaying advanced technology on its roof. The roof is equipped with four distinct devices: two taller, slender cylinders and two shorter, dome-shaped structures. These devices are likely sensors or communication equipment. The vehicle is shown on a road, and a translucent blue circular wave emanates from the roof, suggesting the activation of a radar or sensor system. The vehicle's design is modern, with smooth lines and a streamlined shape, emphasizing its technological sophistication.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a close-up of the roof of a black vehicle, highlighting the advanced technology components, including a taller, slender cylinder and a shorter, dome-shaped structure. A translucent blue circular wave starts to form around the roof, indicating the activation of a radar or sensor system. The camera gradually zooms out, revealing more of the vehicle's roof and the surrounding road environment, which includes lane markings and crosswalks. The blue circular wave continues to expand, further emphasizing the vehicle's technological capabilities. The video concludes with a wider view of the vehicle, showing the blue circular wave fully formed around the roof, with the road and crosswalks in the background.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone provides an overhead view of the roof of a black vehicle driving on a paved road with white painted lines, resembling a crosswalk. The vehicle's roof is glossy black and reflects sunlight. Mounted on the roof are several black communication devices: two taller, thin rod-like antennas and two shorter, dome-shaped units on square bases. Translucent, animated blue rings emanate outwards from the rod antennas, expanding across the roof during the video. The scene occurs during daylight hours under clear conditions, and the road appears blurred due to the vehicle's movement.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium shot, focusing on the rear section of the black vehicle's roof, positioned centrally within the frame. A tall antenna is prominently centered in the foreground, with a dome-shaped device situated slightly behind it in the center-right middle ground. Another tall antenna is partially visible in the top right middle ground. A translucent blue ring emanates from the foreground antenna. The shot then transitions smoothly outwards to a full shot, revealing the entire roof of the vehicle, which remains centered. In this wider view, two tall antennas are visible around the center middle ground, accompanied by two dome devices also in the middle ground. The blue rings now emanate from both tall antennas, expanding across the roof surface. Throughout the sequence, the camera is positioned directly above the vehicle."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
