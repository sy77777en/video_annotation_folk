  "merged_caption": "The video features a bird in a full shot, initially positioned in the center-left of the frame, in the foreground. The bird, characterized by a gray body, white underparts, black wing markings, and a yellow beak with a distinct black tip, is standing on a muddy surface with shallow puddles, which occupy the middle ground and background. The bird's long, slender legs are pale in color, and its posture is upright, suggesting it is foraging or exploring the area. The scene is set outdoors during the daytime under bright sunlight, with uneven, thick brown mud forming mounds and depressions. As the video progresses, the bird begins to walk to the right, moving steadily across the muddy terrain, maintaining a consistent pace and direction. The camera features a high-angle view with deep focus, capturing the bird's movement. It pans right and tilts up to follow the bird, with occasional pauses, and the movement is slightly unsteady, exhibiting some shaking. The bird reaches a new part of the muddy surface, still moving to the right, and pauses briefly, then continues walking, showing no signs of stopping. Throughout the video, the bird maintains its position in the foreground, with the camera remaining at the bird's level, capturing its movement across the uneven terrain. The muddy environment, with its mounds and depressions, forms the backdrop, with the bird's movement creating a dynamic interaction with the scene. The bird's head is turned slightly, indicating alertness or curiosity, and its distinctive appearance, including the yellow facial features, is clearly visible.",

    "Camera": "The video features a high-angle view with deep focus, capturing a bird walking on mud. The camera pans right and tilts up to follow the bird, with occasional pauses. The movement is slightly unsteady, exhibiting some shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video features a bird with a distinctive appearance, characterized by a gray body, white underparts, and black markings on its wings. It has a primarily yellow beak with a distinct black tip at its pointed end and long, slender legs, which are pale in color. The bird is seen standing and walking on a muddy surface, suggesting it is in a wetland or similar environment. Its posture is upright, and it appears to be foraging or exploring the area. The bird's head is turned slightly, indicating alertness or curiosity.",
    "Motion": "A bird with a gray body, white underparts, black wing markings, and a yellow beak is standing on a muddy surface. The bird begins to walk to the right, moving steadily across the muddy terrain. The bird continues its movement, maintaining a consistent pace and direction. The bird reaches a new part of the muddy surface, still moving to the right. The bird pauses briefly, then continues walking, showing no signs of stopping.",
    "Scene": "The video is set outdoors during the daytime under bright sunlight. The scene consists of a muddy area with uneven, thick brown mud forming mounds and depressions. Shallow puddles of murky water are scattered throughout the mud. A single lapwing, characterized by its grey and white feathers, black wing markings, long thin legs, and yellow facial features including the beak, is seen walking across this muddy terrain.",
    "Spatial": "The video features a bird in a full shot, initially positioned in the center-left of the frame, in the foreground. The bird is standing on a muddy surface with shallow puddles, which occupy the middle ground and background. As the video progresses, the bird moves from the left to the right side of the frame, maintaining its position in the foreground. The camera remains at the bird's level throughout, capturing its movement across the uneven terrain. The muddy environment, with its mounds and depressions, forms the backdrop, with the bird's movement creating a dynamic interaction with the scene."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
