  "merged_caption": "From a first-person viewpoint, hands holding a black digital camera are positioned in the foreground at the bottom center, displaying the live view of the scene. The video begins with a close-up of the camera held by the person's hands, capturing a foggy riverside scene. Several traditional wooden boats, predominantly dark brown or red with distinctive yellow accents on their high, curved sterns and bows, are moored in the middle ground, initially centered, alongside a stone-paved quay extending from the bottom left towards the center. A tall, slender, dark lamppost stands on the far left, with multi-story buildings further left behind it lining the waterfront. The river occupies the middle ground and background to the right, enveloped in thick, grey fog that obscures distant structures, visible only as vague outlines in the background center. The faint silhouette of a bridge and a distant building on a hill can be discerned through the haze over the calm water. The camera is positioned at eye level, maintaining a level angle but with a Dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling. It employs deep focus, keeping a large depth of field. Initially, the camera is still with minor handheld shakes, then it pans slightly to the left, moves slightly downward, and looks slightly down, causing the lamppost and buildings to shift towards the center-left of the frame, while the boats move relatively towards the right side. The camera then concludes with a subtle forward movement. The hands and camera remain consistently positioned in the foreground bottom center during the pan. Once filming is complete, the hands lower and disappear from the middle bottom of the frame, making the distant buildings more visible as the camera continues to lower.",

    "Camera": "The video exhibits mild barrel distortion. The camera is positioned at eye level, maintaining a level angle but with a Dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling. It employs deep focus, keeping a large depth of field. Initially, the camera is still with minor handheld shakes, then it pans slightly to the left, concluding with a subtle forward movement. The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video presents a first-person perspective of two light-skinned hands holding a black digital camera, its rear screen displaying the live view of the scene. The camera is aimed at several traditional wooden boats, predominantly dark brown or red with distinctive yellow accents on their high, curved sterns and bows, moored at a stone-paved quay. These boats, possibly rabelo boats, feature masts and some rigging, with small flags visible. A tall, slender, dark lamppost stands on the left edge of the quay, and further left, a multi-story building with visible windows lines the waterfront. The entire scene is enveloped in thick, grey fog, which heavily obscures the background, although the faint silhouette of a bridge and a distant building on a hill can be discerned through the haze over the calm water.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a first-person view shot, showing a close-up of the camera held by the person's hands, capturing the scene in front of them, which includes the foggy quay, the boats, and the distant buildings. As the person adjusts the framing, only their hands are visible making these adjustments. Gradually, the camera is lowered, revealing more of the foggy quay and the boats, while the background remains consistent with the foggy atmosphere. Once filming is complete, the hands lower and disappear from the middle bottom of the frame, making the distant buildings more visible as the camera continues to lower.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, shows a foggy riverside scene. Several traditional wooden boats, dark-colored with yellow sterns, are moored alongside a stone-paved quay. Thick fog hangs heavy over the water, obscuring a distant bridge and buildings on the opposite bank under a pale, overcast sky, likely during the early morning. To the left of the frame, a tall, dark lamppost stands on the quay, and further left, multi-story buildings line the waterfront. Hands holding a black digital camera are visible in the lower portion of the frame, with the camera screen displaying the real-time scene of the boats and the foggy river beyond.",
    "Spatial": "From a first-person viewpoint, hands holding a camera are positioned in the foreground at the bottom center. The scene features several boats moored in the middle ground, initially centered, alongside a stone quay extending from the bottom left towards the center. A lamppost is visible in the middle ground on the far left, with buildings further left behind it. The river occupies the middle ground and background to the right, enveloped in thick fog that obscures distant structures, which are visible only as vague outlines in the background center. The bridge and buildings can only be faintly discerned. The camera then pans slightly to the left, moves slightly downward, and looks slightly down, causing the lamppost and buildings to shift towards the center-left of the frame, while the boats move relatively towards the right side. The hands and camera remain consistently positioned in the foreground bottom center during the pan. The camera perspective appears to be at eye level, looking slightly downwards towards the quay and boats."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
