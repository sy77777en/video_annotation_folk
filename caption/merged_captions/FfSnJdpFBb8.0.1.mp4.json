  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot centered on a patch of green grass and wildflowers in the foreground and middle ground, with the lower bodies of passengers framing the scene on the left, right, and top. Small butterflies flutter over this patch on the floor of a crowded subway car. The camera starts at hip level from a high angle, looking down at the grass and flowers, then tilts up while pulling back and descending, revealing the entire subway car. In this composition, the patch of nature extends from the foreground to the background in the center of the frame. Passengers, including a man with short hair in blue overalls and a dark jacket standing in the center, and a man with a dark beard, glasses, and a red beanie sitting and reading a book to the right, are positioned along the left and right sides, occupying the foreground, middle ground, and background. Other passengers are seen in various poses: some sit on the blue subway seats, looking at their phones or reading, while others stand. Their clothing is casual, including a person in a green jacket, another in a brown coat, and a woman in a black top. One person sitting on the left wears a long skirt and has tan shoes resting near the grassy area. The interior of the car features colorful panels on the upper walls. The camera then smoothly and rapidly dollies backward through the center of the car, transitioning to a low-angle view of the passengers, causing the entire scene to blur. The shot culminates in a rapid backward movement, creating a strong motion blur effect, causing the flowers in the foreground to streak across the frame while the passengers and the car's interior recede into a blurred central point.",

    "Camera": "Starting at hip level from a high angle, the camera looks down at a patch of grass and flowers on the floor of a crowded subway car. It then smoothly and rapidly dollies backward while simultaneously moving down to ground level and tilting up, transitioning to a low-angle view of the passengers. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "The floor of a crowded subway car is covered in a patch of green grass interspersed with small white, purple, and yellow wildflowers, among which small butterflies fly. A diverse group of male and female passengers of various ages are positioned around this patch of nature. In the center of the car, a man with short hair, wearing blue overalls with a dark jacket, stands holding onto an overhead pole. To the right, a man with a dark beard, glasses, and a red beanie sits reading a book. Other passengers are seen in various poses: some sit on the blue subway seats, looking at their phones or reading, while others stand. Their clothing is casual, including a person in a green jacket, another in a brown coat, and a woman in a black top. One person sitting on the left wears a long skirt and has tan shoes resting near the grassy area. The passengers occupy the space around the central patch of grass, creating a contrast between the urban setting and the natural elements on the floor.",
    "Motion": "Small butterflies flutter over a patch of grass and wildflowers on the floor of a subway car. The camera pulls back and tilts upward to reveal a group of mostly stationary passengers sitting and standing inside the car. The camera then rapidly moves backward through the center of the car, causing the entire scene to blur.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set inside a subway car where a patch of green grass with small white, blue, and purple wildflowers grows directly on the checkered floor. Passengers are seated on blue benches and standing, holding onto metal handrails, positioned around the central patch of nature. The interior of the car features colorful panels on the upper walls. The perspective begins at hip level, descends lower in the subsequent movement, pulls back to a wider view of the entire car, and then transitions into a fast, blurred backward motion through the space.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
