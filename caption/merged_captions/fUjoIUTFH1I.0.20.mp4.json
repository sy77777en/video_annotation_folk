  "merged_caption": "This wide, static shot captures an urban street scene in a small town setting, highlighting the architectural details and atmosphere of the area. A row of buildings with prominent balconies occupies the middle ground, extending across the frame from left to right. The buildings feature distinct architectural elements, such as wrought iron balconies adorned with hanging plants, and are connected by a brick wall. Large, white-framed windows and doors are visible, contributing to the essence and character of the location. A sidewalk stretches from the bottom left corner towards the upper right side of the frame, with the street occupying the bottom right. A white vehicle with a paw print logo is partially visible, parked in the right foreground. The time of day appears to be overcast, contributing to a muted color palette dominated by earthy tones and the greenery of the plants, conveying a sense of quiet urban life. The camera is positioned at street level, looking straight on at the ground floor and slightly up towards the balconies, maintaining deep focus and a large depth of field. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement. A woman with a rainbow-colored bag and a black jacket is walking on the street while talking on her phone. She moves from the left side of the frame towards the right, passing by a building with a balcony adorned with hanging plants and a sign that reads 'Royal Street Stones & Jewelry.' Additionally, someone on the balcony appears to be pouring water downwards. Although this is a scenery shot, a person is briefly seen walking from the center towards the left along the sidewalk in the bottom left of the frame, immersing the viewer in the environment.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
