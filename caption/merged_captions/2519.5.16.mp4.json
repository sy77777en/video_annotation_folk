  "merged_caption": "The video features a close-up shot of a man with light skin and short, dark hair, capturing him from the shoulders up. He has a slight beard and mustache, and his expression appears contemplative. The man is centrally positioned in the frame, occupying the foreground, and is wearing a collared shirt with a checkered pattern. Initially, he is facing forward, with his gaze directed downward and his eyes appearing heavy-lidded. As the video progresses, he slightly raises his head and opens his eyes, suggesting a shift in focus or thought. The background is blurred and indistinct, situated behind the man, creating a sense of depth. The camera remains at the subject's eye level throughout the sequence, maintaining a consistent perspective. The lighting emphasizes the man's facial features, highlighting the texture of his skin and keeping him as the focal point against the subdued backdrop. The video presents an indoor setting with a subdued atmosphere, likely captured in a dimly lit room. The environment features muted colors, with soft shadows and a focus on the man's face. The overall scene conveys a quiet, introspective mood, with minimal movement or change throughout the video. The camera features a level angle with an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the foreground. It is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial position of the subject within the frame.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
