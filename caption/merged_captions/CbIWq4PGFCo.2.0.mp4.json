  "merged_caption": "This is a medium-close-up shot focusing on the back of a man's head and shoulders. The man, with short, dark, somewhat tousled hair, is wearing a black top, possibly a t-shirt or a coat, and is positioned in the center of the frame, facing away from the camera. His left ear is visible. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, maintaining a level angle and employing a shallow depth of field, with the focus set on the man in the foreground. The camera executes a counterclockwise arcing movement with slight shaking. The man remains still throughout the video. Behind him, a blurry, light-brown, barren outdoor landscape with indistinct hills or mounds fills both the middleground and background. The ground in the foreground is flat, dry, and light brown, appearing cracked in places. In the distant background, out-of-focus, undulating hills or mounds of a similar light brown or tan color are visible under what seems to be daylight. The scenery and the man are static, with no discernible movement.",

    "Subject": "The video shows the back of a man with short, dark, somewhat tousled hair. He is wearing a black top, possibly a t-shirt or a coat, and is facing away from the camera, looking towards a blurry, light-brown, and indistinct background. His left ear is visible.",
    "Motion": "The man remains still, facing away from the camera.",
    "Scene": "The video shows the back of a man's head and shoulders, with dark, short hair, against a blurred, barren, outdoor landscape. The ground in the foreground is flat, dry, and light brown, appearing cracked in places.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
