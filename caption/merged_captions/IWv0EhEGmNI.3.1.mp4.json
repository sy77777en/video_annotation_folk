  "merged_caption": "From a first-person perspective at eye-level, a rifle is held in the bottom foreground as the camera follows a teammate from behind, maintaining a deep focus with a large depth of field. The scene captures a nighttime environment in a rural, wooded area, viewed through green-tinted night vision. A soldier in full combat gear, including a helmet, light-colored tactical vest with multiple pouches, and a large backpack, is positioned in the center-right of the middle ground, moving forward on a grassy path. A large hay bale is to the left, and the camera moves forward, following the soldier who walks toward a chain-link fence in the distance. A body lies on the ground to the left of the walking soldier. The weapon in the foreground is then swapped from the rifle to a pistol as the camera stops, with the followed soldier now positioned in the left-middle ground near a rock and trees. The view includes a heads-up display with various on-screen elements, such as a vertical gauge on the left and ammunition information in the bottom right corner. Text at the top left briefly reads \"Checkpoint reached,\" and a subtitle at the bottom center reads, \"Price: Overlook's ahead...\" An icon briefly identifies the soldier's weapon as an AK-47.",

    "Camera": "From a smooth, first-person perspective in a video game, the camera follows a teammate from behind. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle and maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp with a large depth of field.",
    "Subject": "From a first-person perspective through green-tinted night vision, a pair of hands in light-colored gloves holds a rifle with a red dot sight. The view follows another soldier walking away from the camera. This soldier is dressed in full combat gear, including a helmet, a light-colored tactical vest with multiple pouches, and a large backpack. An icon briefly identifies their weapon as an AK-47. A body lies on the ground to the left of the walking soldier. Later, the hands in the foreground switch from the rifle to a pistol.",
    "Motion": "From a first-person perspective, the camera follows a soldier in full combat gear as they walk forward on a grassy path at night. The soldier moves away from the camera, heading toward a fence in the distance. The hands in the foreground then lower a rifle out of view and raise a pistol.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a nighttime scene in a rural, wooded area, viewed through green-tinted night vision. The camera moves forward across a grassy field with large, round hay bales on the left. In the background, the dark silhouettes of pine trees stand against the night sky, and a chain-link fence with a gate is visible to the right. The scene includes a heads-up display with various on-screen elements. Text at the top left briefly reads \"Checkpoint reached.\" A vertical gauge is on the left, and ammunition information is displayed in the bottom right corner. A subtitle at the bottom center reads, \"Price: Overlook's ahead...\"",
    "Spatial": "From a first-person perspective at eye-level, a rifle is held in the bottom foreground. A soldier is positioned in the center-right of the middle ground, with a large hay bale to the left. The camera moves forward, following the soldier who walks toward the background, revealing a body on the ground to their left. A chain-link fence becomes more defined in the right background. The weapon in the foreground is then swapped from the rifle to a pistol. The camera stops, with the followed soldier now positioned in the left-middle ground near a rock and trees."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
