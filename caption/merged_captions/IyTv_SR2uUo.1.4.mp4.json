  "merged_caption": "The shot begins as a full shot, capturing a young, light-skinned person with long blonde hair running in the right foreground, wearing a black and pink short-sleeved rugby jersey, black shorts, long black socks with white accents, and dark athletic shoes. To the runner's right, on the left side of the frame, a light-skinned man with short dark hair and a black headband walks and observes, dressed in a pink t-shirt, dark shorts, and white athletic shoes. A group of other young people in similar black and pink rugby uniforms stands in the right middle ground, with a white line running across the immediate foreground. The background consists of a large stadium with arched architecture and sections of blue, red, and green seating, a cityscape with several tall buildings, and a distant mountain range. The runner moves from right to left, and as she passes close to the subject-level camera, the framing briefly becomes a medium shot. The camera, exhibiting mild barrel distortion and maintaining deep focus, pans left to follow her as she moves away into the middle ground, transitioning back to a full shot. She then approaches a man in a dark vest holding a large yellow tackle pad in the center middle ground before moving toward the left of the frame. The outdoor scene is captured from an eye-level perspective on a green grass sports field under an overcast sky, with several people on the field, including the group of young athletes performing a drill that involves running and tackling the large, yellow, cylindrical training dummy. The camera focuses on the football player sprinting from right to left, tracking her by moving and panning leftward, maintaining a coherent narrative of the action.",

    "Camera": "This ground-level, level-angle shot exhibits mild barrel distortion and maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera focuses on a football player sprinting from right to left, tracking him by moving and panning leftward.",
    "Subject": "The video primarily features a young, light-skinned person with long blonde hair running on a grassy field. This individual is wearing a black and pink short-sleeved rugby jersey, black shorts, long black socks with white accents, and dark athletic shoes. To the runner's right, on the left side of the frame, a light-skinned man with short dark hair and a black headband walks and observes; he is dressed in a pink t-shirt, dark shorts, and white athletic shoes. Standing in a line behind the runner is a group of other young people, also wearing the same black and pink rugby uniforms. Later in the video, the runner is seen interacting with a large yellow tackle pad held by a man in a dark vest.",
    "Motion": "A person with long blonde hair runs forward on a grassy field, while a man in a pink shirt walks alongside them. The runner then approaches and makes contact with a large yellow tackle pad being held by another man. In the background, a group of other young people in similar uniforms stands in a line.",
    "Scene": "This outdoor scene is captured from an eye-level perspective on a green grass sports field under an overcast sky. A white line runs across the foreground of the turf. In the background, a large stadium with arched architecture and sections of blue, red, and green seating is visible. Beyond the stadium, a cityscape with several tall buildings and a distant mountain range can be seen. Several people are on the field, including a group of young athletes in black and pink uniforms and a man in a pink shirt. The athletes are performing a drill that involves running and tackling a large, yellow, cylindrical training dummy. Next to the yellow training dummy, there is a man dressed in dark clothing.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
