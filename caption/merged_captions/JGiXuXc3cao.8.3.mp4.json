  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a white, submersible vehicle centered against a solid black background. The vehicle, with an elongated, rectangular, cage-like frame through which some internal components are visible, is suspended by a single, thin white cable extending upwards into the darkness. From its underside, two distinct, conical beams of light are projected downwards and outwards. The camera slowly arcs counterclockwise around the stationary submersible, completing only a quarter turn while simultaneously moving backward to create distance from it. This movement results in the submersible being positioned at the top center of the frame, with the two beams of light emitted from beneath it slightly above the center. The beams then diverge downward, filling the lower left and right sections of the frame. The scene is entirely monochromatic, featuring the stark white of the submersible and its cable against the deep black background, creating a striking contrast as the lights cut through the otherwise pitch-black environment.",

    "Camera": "This is a shot of a submersible in the dark. The camera slowly arcs counterclockwise around the submersible, completing only a quarter turn, while simultaneously moving backward to create distance from it. This movement positions the two beams of light emitted from beneath the submersible slightly above the center of the frame, with the downward-diverging tails of these beams filling the lower left and right sections of the frame.",
    "Subject": "A white, submersible vehicle is depicted against a solid black background. The vehicle has an elongated, rectangular, cage-like frame, through which some internal components are visible. It is suspended from a single, thin white cable extending upwards. From its underside, two distinct, conical beams of light are projected downwards and outwards.",
    "Motion": "The submersible vehicle remains stationary, suspended in the dark space by a single, thin white cable extending upward.",
    "Scene": "In a vast, black void, a white, cage-like submersible is suspended by a thin cable extending upwards into the darkness. The long, cylindrical vehicle is equipped with two forward-facing lights that cast distinct, conical beams downward, cutting through the otherwise pitch-black environment. The scene is entirely monochromatic, featuring the stark white of the submersible and its cable against the deep black background. The camera arcs counterclockwise, making a quarter turn until the two beams of light emitted from beneath the submersible are positioned slightly above the center of the frame.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a full shot of a white submersible centered against a black background. A thin cable extends from the submersible to the top center of the frame, while two beams of light project from its underside. As the camera moves counterclockwise and pulls back, the submersible remains stationary. This movement results in a quarter turn, positioning the submersible at the top center of the frame and the light beams slightly above the center. The beams then diverge downward, filling the lower left and right sections of the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
