  "merged_caption": "This is a medium shot focusing on a large, leafless tree, viewed from a low angle looking upwards. The thick trunk occupies the bottom right foreground and extends towards the center. Numerous bare branches spread out from the trunk, filling the center, left, and top right portions of the frame, positioned in the foreground and middle ground. The clear blue sky serves as the background, visible between the intricate network of branches, particularly in the left and top center. A point of bright sunlight creates a lens flare near a branch in the left slightly bottom middle ground. The video begins with a close-up view of the tree, focusing on its thick trunk and sprawling branches. The camera slowly pans to the left, maintaining the focus on the tree's trunk and branches, which remain barren and devoid of leaves. The sunlight creates a lens flare effect as it filters through the branches, adding a subtle glow to the scene. The camera continues to move left, revealing more of the tree's structure and the intricate patterns on its bark. The video concludes with the camera still panning left, providing a comprehensive view of the tree's trunk and branches from a slightly different angle. The camera features a worm's-eye view angle, looking directly up at the sky and a tree, and rolls smoothly clockwise, maintaining a deep focus with a large depth of field, ensuring all elements remain sharp. The tree's imposing structure and intricate details are highlighted, emphasizing its size and natural complexity. The setting is serene and natural, with no visible human-made structures or movement, emphasizing the tree's grandeur and the open sky. The time of day appears to be midday, as indicated by the bright, direct sunlight illuminating the scene.",

    "Camera": "The video features a worm's-eye view angle, looking directly up at the sky and a tree. The camera rolls smoothly clockwise, maintaining a deep focus with a large depth of field, ensuring all elements remain sharp.",
    "Subject": "The video features a large, leafless tree with a thick, textured trunk and numerous sprawling branches extending outward. The bark is rough and gray, with visible patterns and knots. The branches are bare, showcasing a network of smaller twigs against the sky. The tree's imposing structure and intricate details are highlighted, emphasizing its size and natural complexity.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a close-up view of a large, leafless tree, focusing on its thick trunk and sprawling branches against a clear blue sky.

    "Scene": "The video captures an outdoor scene featuring a large, leafless tree with thick, textured branches extending outward against a clear blue sky. The tree's bark is rough and gray, with distinctive markings and a robust trunk. Sunlight filters through the branches, creating lens flares and subtle shadows on the tree's surface. The setting is serene and natural, with no visible human-made structures or movement, emphasizing the tree's grandeur and the open sky. The time of day appears to be midday, as indicated by the bright, direct sunlight illuminating the scene.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
