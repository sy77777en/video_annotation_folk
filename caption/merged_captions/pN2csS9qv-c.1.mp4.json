  "merged_caption": "This medium shot, filmed at the subjects' level, initially centers on a gymnast in a red leotard with an oval-shaped back design in the middle ground, viewed from the side. She is surrounded by celebrating people, with a woman in black on the far left foreground and a man in a suit on the right, both also in the middle ground. Gymnastics equipment occupies the center of the scene in the middle ground. The gymnast finishes her routine and is greeted by teammates and coaches who are clapping and cheering. The gymnast walks towards her teammates, and they all raise their hands in celebration. Two other gymnasts in similar red leotards join her, and together they raise their hands in a celebratory gesture. The background shows a gymnasium with a banner that reads '@BYUCOUGARS' and other people watching the event. The setting includes gymnastic equipment like uneven bars, with a blue mat covering the floor. The environment is lively, with participants wearing red leotards adorned with sparkles, indicating a competitive or celebratory atmosphere. The gymnasium has high ceilings and visible seating areas, suggesting a space designed for sports events. The lighting is bright, typical of indoor sports venues, and the overall scene conveys a sense of activity and movement, with individuals interacting energetically around the equipment. As the clip progresses, the central gymnast turns slightly towards the camera and is partially obscured by two gymnasts in red leotards in the middle and right foreground. The shot concludes with both gymnasts positioned in the center and right-center of the frame in the foreground, still seen from behind as they interact with people on either side. The handheld camera begins with a slight but very unsteady pan to the right, capturing the celebration, and concludes with a subtle zoom out. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.",

    "Camera": "The video captures cheerleaders celebrating. The camera is at eye level and maintains a level angle. It uses deep focus with a large depth of field. The handheld camera begins with a slight but very unsteady pan to the right, capturing the celebration, and concludes with a subtle zoom out. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video features a group of female gymnasts with light complexions and light brown hair celebrating near gymnastics equipment. They are wearing matching red leotards with sheer black sleeves and rhinestone embellishments. Their hair is styled in buns. The women are engaged in a joyful interaction, clapping and high-fiving each other. Several women in black athletic wear, possibly coaches or team members, are also visible, joining in the celebration with raised hands. The setting appears to be an indoor sports venue, indicated by the presence of gymnastic apparatus and a banner in the background.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
