  "merged_caption": "A person is featured in a medium close-up, positioned in the center of the frame and occupying the foreground against a solid black background. The subject remains mostly still, exhibiting slight movements, including subtle head tilts and minor swaying, with a lettered badge on their chest seen fluttering. The camera is positioned at eye level and a level angle, slightly tilting up and then moving forward smoothly, capturing the person wearing a dark, heavy coat with a prominent fur-lined hood that obscures most of their face, except for their nose, which is visible at the beginning and reveals a light skin tone. The coat has visible zippers and buttons, and the hood's fur is thick and light brown, creating a striking contrast against the dark fabric. The lighting highlights the fur-lined hood, while the person's face is mostly obscured, with only the nose visible, as the rest is either covered by the hood or enveloped in shadow. The video is in slow motion, enhancing the shadowy atmosphere that emphasizes the texture of the fur and the material of the jacket. The overall appearance suggests a focus on warmth and protection from cold weather, with the subdued mood drawing attention to the details of their outerwear.",

    "Camera": "The video is in slow motion, with the camera positioned at eye level and a level angle. It slightly tilts up and then moves forward smoothly, focusing on a person wearing a fur-lined hood against a black background.",
    "Subject": "The video features a person wearing a dark, heavy coat with a prominent fur-lined hood that obscures most of their face, except for their nose, which is visible at the beginning and reveals a light skin tone. The coat has visible zippers and buttons, and the hood's fur is thick and light brown, creating a striking contrast against the dark fabric. The person is facing forward, and their face is mostly hidden by the hood and high collar of the coat, making it difficult to discern specific facial features or expressions. The overall appearance suggests a focus on warmth and protection from cold weather.",
    "Motion": "The video shows a person wearing a black coat with a fur-lined hood, standing against a dark background. The person's face is mostly obscured by the hood and high collar, with only the nose visible. The coat features visible zippers and buttons, and the fur on the hood is thick and light brown. While the person remains largely stationary, there are slight movements, including subtle head tilts and minor swaying. Additionally, a lettered badge on their chest is seen fluttering.",
    "Scene": "The video presents a dimly lit, indoor setting with a focus on a person wearing a dark jacket featuring a prominent fur-lined hood. The fur is a mix of brown and beige tones, providing a stark contrast against the black background. The jacket has visible zippers and buttons, adding metallic accents to the scene. The lighting is low, creating a shadowy atmosphere that emphasizes the texture of the fur and the material of the jacket. The overall mood is subdued, with the person centrally positioned, drawing attention to the details of their outerwear.",
    "Spatial": "A person is featured in a medium close-up, positioned in the center of the frame and occupying the foreground. The subject remains mostly still, exhibiting slight movements, against a solid black background, with the camera positioned at their level. The lighting highlights the fur-lined hood, while the person's face is mostly obscured, with only the nose visible, as the rest is either covered by the hood or enveloped in shadow."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
