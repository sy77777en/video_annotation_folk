  "merged_caption": "This medium close-up shot is framed through the wooden lattice wall of a yurt, which occupies the entire foreground. Initially, a light-skinned woman wearing a white patterned head covering and a pink top is positioned in the center of the middle ground, her hands actively engaged in wrapping a pink rope around a wooden pole, tying it to the top of the lattice wall. She pulls the rope to tighten the knot, securing the pole in place. The lattice wall is decorated with a horizontal, woven band featuring a red, green, and white geometric pattern. In the distance to the left behind the woman, a horse and a man riding a horse are visible, while another person stands closer to her on the right in the middle ground. This person, wearing a dark headscarf with white patterns, a light-colored sweatshirt with green sleeves, and a green hat, moves out of view as the camera performs an unsteady counterclockwise arc. The background is filled with a green valley and snow-capped mountains under a bright sky. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, focuses on the wooden yurt frame in the foreground, utilizing a shallow depth of field. As the camera moves to the right, the central woman remains in the middle of the frame, while the horses remain partially visible, only becoming partially obstructed. In the middle ground, people can be seen actively working on the structure, and in the expansive meadow, a horse grazes. The scene is set outdoors in a wide, green valley during the daytime, with large, snow-capped mountains visible in the background.",

    "Camera": "From an eye-level, level-angle perspective, the camera focuses on the wooden yurt frame in the foreground, utilizing a shallow depth of field. The camera performs a slightly unsteady counterclockwise arc.",
    "Subject": "A light-skinned woman is partially visible behind a wooden lattice structure, which appears to be the wall of a yurt. She wears a white patterned head covering and a pink top. Her arms and hands are actively engaged in tying a wooden stick to a wooden shelf using a pink rope around the joints of the light-colored wooden slats. The lattice wall itself is decorated with a horizontal, woven band featuring a red, green, and white geometric pattern. On her right, there is another woman wearing a dark headscarf with white patterns. She is dressed in a light-colored sweatshirt with green sleeves and a green hat. As the camera moves to the right, she disappears from view.",
    "Motion": "A woman's hands move as she wraps a pink rope around a wooden pole, tying it to the top of a wooden lattice wall. She pulls the rope to tighten the knot, securing the pole in place. In the background, another person moves while also working on the structure.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set outdoors in a wide, green valley during the daytime, with large, snow-capped mountains visible in the background under a bright sky. In the foreground, a light-colored wooden lattice wall, characteristic of a yurt, is being assembled. The crisscrossing wooden poles are secured with various ties, including natural-fiber ropes, bright pink cords, and a decorative woven band with a red and green geometric pattern that runs horizontally. In the middle ground, people can be seen actively working on the structure, and in the distance, a horse grazes in the expansive meadow.",
    "Spatial": "This medium close-up shot is framed through the wooden lattice wall of a yurt, which occupies the entire foreground. Initially, a woman is positioned in the center of the middle ground, her hands working in the upper center of the frame. In the distance to the left behind the woman, a horse and a man riding a horse are visible, while another person stands closer to her on the right in the middle ground. The background is filled with a green valley and snow-capped mountains. As the camera performs an unsteady counterclockwise arc, the central woman remains in the middle of the frame. The person on the right moves out of view, but the horses remain partially visible, only becoming partially obstructed. The camera is positioned at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
