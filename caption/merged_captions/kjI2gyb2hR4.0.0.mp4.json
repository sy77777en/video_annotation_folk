  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a low-angle medium close-up of a young Black man with short, black hair styled in a high-top fade, positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. He wears a denim varsity-style jacket with a striped collar and cuffs over a white collared shirt. His hands, holding several small, rectangular objects, possibly tickets or cards, are in the foreground. A roll-down metal shutter with horizontal slats is visible in the background, filling the left and central portions of the shot. The scene is set outdoors at night, illuminated by a warm light source positioned to the man's left, casting deep shadows and partially illuminating him. The man maintains a focused and serious expression as he keeps his head and gaze lowered, concentrating on the objects in his hands. He moves the object in his right hand slightly upward while examining it. The camera, shot from a low angle, smoothly ascends from around hip level to eye level while moving slightly forward, transitioning to a close-up that tightens the frame on the man's face while he remains centrally positioned. A shallow depth of field keeps the focus on the man in the midground. The shot ends with a slight downward tilt, maintaining the focus on his face, which is illuminated by the warm light from his left side, as he continues to look down at the objects he holds. The surrounding environment is enveloped in darkness, with the closed metal shutter forming the background.",

    "Scene": "An outdoor scene at night is illuminated by a light source positioned to the person's left, casting deep shadows. A person wearing a denim and striped jacket is seated in the middle ground, partially illuminated by the same focused light. Their hands are positioned in the foreground against a closed, roll-down metal shutter with horizontal slats, which forms the background. The surrounding environment is enveloped in darkness.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
