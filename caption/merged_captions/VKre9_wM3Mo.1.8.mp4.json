  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a stylized, translucent gray flush toilet against a dark gray background with very dim lighting. The toilet bowl is positioned in the bottom left foreground, and the tank is in the center, with its white, rectangular lid levitating directly above it, revealing the tank's interior filled with bright blue, opaque water. A white flush handle is visible on the right side of the tank. White text \"Flush toilet\" is overlaid on the screen, while a blurred white object is in the top left background. The camera is at eye level, positioned at a high angle looking down, capturing the entire toilet rather than just the tank. As the camera moves smoothly upwards and tilts downwards, the lid of the tank begins to lift, highlighting the swirling motion of the blue water inside. The focus remains on the movement of the water within the tank, with the lid staying lifted throughout the process. As the shot transitions towards a full shot, the camera appears to pull back slightly, revealing more of the bowl. Simultaneously, the blue water begins to flow from the tank down into the toilet bowl. The overall appearance suggests a ceramic or similar smooth material for the toilet's construction.",

    "Camera": "The camera is at eye level, positioned at a high angle looking down. The video shows a toilet with shallow focus on the middle ground. The camera moves smoothly upwards and tilts downwards.",
    "Subject": "The video showcases a white/light gray flush toilet with a partially transparent or cutaway view. The toilet features a bowl with the seat down and a rectangular tank positioned above and behind the bowl. The lid of the tank is shown levitating above it, revealing the tank's interior filled with bright blue water. As the camera moves, you can observe the flow of blue water from the rectangular tank into the toilet bowl. A white flush handle is visible on the right side of the tank, and the overall appearance suggests a ceramic or similar smooth material for the toilet's construction.",
    "Motion": "The video starts with a high-angle view of a flush toilet, capturing the entire toilet rather than just the tank. The lid of the tank begins to lift, revealing the swirling blue water inside. As the lid continues to rise, the swirling motion of the water is highlighted, but it is not immediately clear that the water is flowing into the bowl. The focus remains on the movement of the water within the tank, with the lid staying lifted throughout the process.",
    "Scene": "The video shows a stylized, translucent gray flush toilet against a dark gray background with very dim lighting. The toilet tank is partially filled with bright blue, opaque water. The white, rectangular tank lid is shown levitating above the tank and appears to hover without lowering. In the bottom left corner, white text overlay reads \"[1,2,3,4] Flush toilet\". There is a blurred white object in the upper left corner of the background.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium shot of a flush toilet. The toilet bowl is positioned in the bottom left foreground. The tank is in the center, with its lid levitating directly above it. Bright blue water is visible inside the tank, and a white flush handle is on the tank's right side. White text \"Flush toilet\" is overlaid on the screen, while a blurred white object is in the top left background. As the shot transitions towards a full shot, the camera appears to pull back slightly, revealing more of the bowl. Simultaneously, the blue water begins to flow from the tank down into the toilet bowl. The camera is positioned above the subject."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
