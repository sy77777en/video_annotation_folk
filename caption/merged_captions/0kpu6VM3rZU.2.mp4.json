  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium close-up shot of a woman with long, straight black hair, wearing a metallic-colored dress and large hoop earrings, positioned in the foreground and centered in the frame. She holds a trophy and speaks into a microphone labeled \"ET Canada.\" The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, initially focusing on the interviewee with deep focus and a large depth of field. As the camera gradually zooms out, transitioning to a medium shot, it slightly pans left to include another woman entering the frame from the left side, standing beside the first woman. This second woman has long, wavy brown hair and is wearing a dress with intricate lace detailing. She holds a microphone in her left hand, initially directing it towards the woman in the metallic dress, then turns it towards herself and speaks, using expressive gestures with her right hand. Both women are engaged in conversation, facing each other, with the setting suggesting a formal event or interview. The interviewer appears in the left foreground of the frame, while the interviewee shifts to the middle ground on the right side of the frame. A crowd of formally dressed individuals is visible in the middle ground, extending towards the backdrop of large, modern buildings and decorative elements, including a building with a red and white patterned banner. The environment is lively, with a crowd of people dressed in formal attire, suggesting a glamorous occasion. The setting includes a red carpet and transparent curtains, contributing to the formal event atmosphere. The \"ET Canada\" logo is consistently displayed in the bottom left corner, anchoring the broadcast context. The camera's movement from a medium close-up to a medium shot effectively captures the interaction between the two women while keeping the lively event environment in view.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
