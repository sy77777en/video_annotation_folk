  "merged_caption": "The video features an extreme wide shot of a dense urban landscape captured from a high aerial perspective, filmed by a drone on an overcast day. The scene showcases a grid-like arrangement of densely packed, multi-story buildings and blocks, with horizontal lanes running level across the frame and two other lanes intersecting vertically, extending from the bottom to the top of the frame. The rooftops vary in color and shape, including shades of dark grey, light grey, dark brown, reddish-brown, dark blue, and a prominent flat white roof, with some buildings featuring balconies and visible chimneys or ventilation systems. The overall color palette is characterized by low saturation with dark tones. As the shot progresses, the camera smoothly trucks to the right, maintaining the expansive aerial view. The arrangement of buildings and blocks remains consistent, with new urban structures and street sections entering from the right, enhancing the panoramic cityscape. The camera is at an aerial level, providing a high-angle view of the scene, and maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping all elements sharp. Straight, intersecting roads run between the blocks, with a few parked or slowly moving vehicles, including a white van, traveling on them. The focus is on the overall urban texture and architectural patterns rather than a singular subject, emphasizing the scale and layout of the city block. The drone's movement provides a slow, sweeping view across the architectural landscape, with the camera smoothly trucking right across the rooftops.",

    "Subject": "The video presents a cityscape scenery shot, offering an aerial perspective of densely packed, multi-story buildings with varied roof styles and colors, including gabled, flat, and hipped roofs in shades of grey, black, red, white, etc. The focus is on the overall urban texture and architectural patterns rather than a singular subject, emphasizing the scale and layout of the city block.

    "Motion": "This is an aerial scenery shot of a city, with the camera smoothly trucking right across the rooftops.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone offers an aerial perspective of a densely packed urban environment during what appears to be an overcast day. The scene is dominated by the rooftops of multi-story buildings, which are closely aligned along narrow streets. These rooftops vary in color and shape, including shades of dark grey, light grey, dark brown, reddish-brown, and dark blue, with one prominent flat white roof. Some buildings feature balconies and visible chimneys or ventilation systems. The streets below show a few parked or slowly moving vehicles, including a white van.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
