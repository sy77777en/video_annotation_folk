  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot, the Fountain of Neptune is positioned in the center of the frame, with a crowd of people occupying the foreground at the bottom and historic buildings in the background. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, pans from left to right in an arc around the monument. As the camera moves, the large white marble statue remains the central focus, while the background architecture shifts, with the prominent stone facade of a building moving from the right side of the frame to a position directly behind the fountain. This time-lapse video is filmed from a low, eye-level perspective, utilizing a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp. The camera performs a very smooth clockwise arc around the central fountain. The video's main subject is a monumental white marble statue of a nude, muscular man, Neptune, standing in the center of an ornate fountain. The statue is crowned, has a beard, and looks down and to its left while holding a staff-like object in its right hand. At the base of this central figure are several white marble statues of horses. Bronze-colored statues of other mythological figures are positioned around the central statue. The fountain is situated in a public square surrounded by historic, multi-story stone and stucco buildings under a clear blue sky. In a sunlit public square in Florence, Italy, the ornate Fountain of Neptune stands as the central feature. The fountain showcases a large, white marble statue of a crowned, nude male figure at its apex, surrounded by smaller bronze sculptures of mythical figures and sea horses at its base, from which water spouts. The square is enclosed by historic, multi-story buildings constructed from tan and brown stone and stucco, with the prominent stone facade of the Palazzo Vecchio visible in the background against a clear, deep blue sky.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
