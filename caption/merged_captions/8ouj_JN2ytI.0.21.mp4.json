  "merged_caption": "This wide shot captures a football game on a green artificial turf field marked with white lines. In the middle ground, a player in a yellow jersey with the black number \"14\" is positioned slightly right of center, facing away from the viewer. To his left, another player in a similar uniform slightly moves to the left to catch the ball and prepares to run to the right side of the frame. Further to the right in the middle ground, two additional players in yellow and black uniforms are visible, exiting the frame as the camera pans from right to left. A referee in a black and white striped shirt stands in the middle ground, slightly left of center, facing towards the right, with his arms raised as if waving flags. A tall, yellow, U-shaped goalpost is prominent on the left side of the frame, extending from the middle ground upwards. The green football field stretches from the foreground to the background. The stadium stands, filled with a large crowd predominantly in yellow, occupy the background across the upper portion of the frame. The eye-level camera employs deep focus with a large depth of field, exhibiting minor, smooth, and quick movement, panning from right to left and tilting down, likely following the action on the football field. The video presents a dynamic moment on the football field during an overcast day, looking down the length of the field. The stadium structure itself is made of grey concrete and metal. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, capturing the scene as the players and referee move, while the crowd in the stadium stands remains still.",

    "Scene": "The video presents a football game in progress from an objective viewpoint during an overcast day, looking down the length of a green artificial turf field marked with white yard lines. A tall, yellow, U-shaped goalpost stands prominently on the left side of the field. The stadium stands are packed with a large crowd, predominantly dressed in yellow, creating a dense sea of color. The stadium structure itself is made of grey concrete and metal. Several players in yellow and black uniforms are on the field, along with a referee in a black and white striped shirt.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
