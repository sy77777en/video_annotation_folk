  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot capturing eight people on a red sports court surrounded by a chain-link fence, set in a park-like environment. Six individuals form a circle in the middle ground, facing a person in the center, while another stands outside the circle. The camera is positioned above the subjects, providing a high-angle view from around second-floor height. The scene takes place during the day, under clear skies, with bright and even lighting. The central figure, wearing a green jacket and white pants, holds a basketball and begins to throw it upwards. As the basketball ascends, it starts to transform, revealing a face on its surface. The basketball continues to rise, and its face becomes more prominent, while the people around it watch. The camera features a speed ramp effect, smoothly transitioning between fast and slow speeds. As the video progresses, the focus shifts to a basketball in the foreground, which remains sharp and clear, while the people in the background become heavily blurred, likely due to a post-production effect. The basketball, now fully transformed into a ball with a face, moves closer to the camera, speaking as it does so. The basketball is notable for its unique design, featuring a textured surface with a face imprinted on it. The camera remains completely static throughout, with no movement or shaking, maintaining a consistent overhead perspective. The setting is urban, with hints of graffiti visible on nearby structures, adding an element of street art to the environment. The overall atmosphere is dynamic, with the participants' movements suggesting interaction and play. The scene transitions to a full shot of the basketball, which moves from the middle ground to the foreground, becoming the focal point, centered in the frame.",

    "Camera": "The video features a speed ramp effect, smoothly transitioning between fast and slow speeds. The camera is positioned at an overhead level, around second-floor height, with a high angle looking down. It begins with deep focus on a group of people playing basketball. As the video progresses, the focus shifts to a basketball in the foreground, which remains sharp and clear, while the people in the background become heavily blurred, likely due to a post-production effect. The camera remains completely static throughout, with no movement or shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video features eight people on a red sports court. Six individuals form a circle facing a person in the center, while another person stands outside the circle. A basketball, initially held by a person in the group, becomes the focal point as it transitions to the foreground, revealing a face imprinted on its surface. This transition highlights the basketball's unique design, shifting the viewer's focus from the group interaction to the ball itself.",
    "Motion": "On a red sports court surrounded by a metal fence, a group of eight people are engaged in a game. The central figure, wearing a green jacket and white pants, holds a basketball and begins to throw it upwards. As the basketball ascends, it starts to transform, revealing a face on its surface. The basketball continues to rise, and its face becomes more prominent, while the people around it watch. The basketball, now fully transformed into a ball with a face, moves closer to the camera, speaking as it does so.",
    "Scene": "The video captures an outdoor basketball court surrounded by a chain-link fence, set in a park-like environment. The court's surface is a deep red, contrasting with the urban surroundings. The scene takes place during the day, under clear skies, providing bright and even lighting. A group of people is positioned in a circle on the court, engaged in an activity involving a basketball. The basketball is notable for its unique design, featuring a textured surface with a face imprinted on it. The setting is urban, with hints of graffiti visible on nearby structures, adding an element of street art to the environment. The overall atmosphere is dynamic, with the participants' movements suggesting interaction and play.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
