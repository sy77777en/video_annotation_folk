  "merged_caption": "In a rolling close-up shot, a pair of light-skinned hands, emerging from white sleeves, unfolds a grey, soft, fabric-like object with a black zipper in the left middle ground against a white tiled surface. Initially, a small, articulated wooden artist's mannequin stands in a dynamic pose in the top-left background, with a light-colored wooden crate holding a cluster of bright orange oranges and a glass jar of pasta with a cork stopper in the top background. The frame then rapidly rotates clockwise, causing the entire scene, including the static background elements, to tilt, shifting the hands and fabric to the top right. This transition reveals green celery, a yellow bell pepper, and a red bell pepper positioned behind a bright orange plastic clip in the middle ground on the left, while the crate and mannequin move to the bottom-right background. At the end, the mannequin disappears, and the crate moves to the top-right background. Throughout the shot, the white text \"THAT UNFOLDS\" remains fixed in the center, and a black box in the top right corner contains the white text \"*patent pending\". The camera is positioned at the subject's level and defined by a smooth, continuous clockwise roll, creating a varying Dutch angle that shifts the perspective from right side up to upside down and then back to right side up. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the focus on the midground. Nearby, a red pomegranate, a dark purple fig, and a small green succulent are visible, adding to the scene's composition.",

    "Camera": "This ground-level shot is defined by a smooth, continuous clockwise roll. This motion creates a varying Dutch angle, causing the perspective to shift from right side up to upside down and then back to right side up. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the focus on the midground, where a pair of hands unfolds a grey object on a white surface.",
    "Subject": "A pair of light-skinned hands, emerging from white sleeves, unfolds a grey, soft, fabric-like object with a black zipper against a white tiled surface. The scene includes various food items: a cluster of bright orange oranges and a glass jar of pasta with a cork stopper are placed on top of a light-colored wooden crate. Nearby, a red pomegranate, a dark purple fig, and a small green succulent are visible. Green celery, a yellow bell pepper, and a red bell pepper are positioned on the surface and behind a bright orange plastic clip. A small, articulated wooden artist's mannequin stands in a dynamic pose. The white text \"THAT UNFOLDS\" is centered on the screen, while a black box in the upper right corner contains the white text \"*patent pending\".",
    "Motion": "A pair of hands unfolds a grey fabric object, spreading it out flat against a white surface. The camera rotates clockwise, causing the entire scene, including the static background elements, to tilt.",
    "Scene": "An indoor scene with a tilted perspective features a white tiled surface and a wooden shelf. On the shelf are a cluster of bright orange oranges and a glass jar of pasta with a cork stopper. On the surface are oranges, a pomegranate, a small succulent, a wooden artist's mannequin, and glass jars containing pasta and green onions. A person's hands unfold a gray fabric item against the surface, while in another view, fresh vegetables like celery and bell peppers are positioned behind an orange plastic clip. An overlay displays the white text \"THAT UNFOLDS\" in the center of the scene, and a black box in the top right corner contains the text \"*patent pending\".",
    "Spatial": "In a rolling close-up shot, a pair of hands unfolds a grey fabric object in the left middle ground. Initially, a wooden mannequin occupies the top-left background, with a wooden crate holding oranges and pasta in the top background. The frame then rapidly rotates, shifting the hands and fabric to the top right. This transition reveals vegetables and an orange clip in the middle ground on the left, while the crate and mannequin move to the bottom-right background. At the end, the mannequin disappears, and the crate moves to the top-right background. Throughout the shot, the text \"THAT UNFOLDS\" remains fixed in the center, and a \"*patent pending\" notice stays in the top right corner. The camera is positioned at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
