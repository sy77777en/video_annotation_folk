  "merged_caption": "This wide shot, captured from directly above, shows a straight, four-lane road running horizontally across the center of the frame, cutting through a barren desert landscape with sparse vegetation. A central truck, featuring a white cargo area and a dark green cab, is positioned in the center of the frame on the road. It is flanked by five green military vehicles, initially glowing light green, with three to its front and two to its back. Two black vehicles are also visible on the road, one further to the left and one further to the right. The desert landscape occupies the top and bottom portions of the frame, acting as the background. The initial green glow around the five vehicles fades shortly after the clip begins. The vehicles maintain a steady formation and speed, moving towards the left of the frame as the camera tracks their movement, keeping them centered in the frame throughout the clip. The video, filmed by a drone, features an aerial-level camera at a bird's-eye view, looking directly down at the convoy. The camera employs deep focus, maintaining clarity across the entire scene. It smoothly ascends upward and moves to the left, tracking the convoy as it progresses. As the camera ascends, the vehicles appear smaller in the frame, indicating a change in perspective while maintaining a steady and smooth motion. The scene is set in a desert-like environment, with the road flanked by sandy terrain, and the time of day appears to be daytime, as indicated by the lighting. The arrangement and movement of the vehicles imply a coordinated travel or escort scenario, with the military vehicles distinct due to their green color and boxy shape, typical of armored transport.",

    "Subject": "The video shows a top-down view of a road with multiple vehicles. A central truck, featuring a white cargo area and a dark green cab, is surrounded by several green military vehicles. Initially, the three military vehicles in front of the central truck and the two behind emit a glowing light green hue, which then fades back to their original dark green color. The vehicles are evenly spaced along the road, suggesting a convoy formation. There is one green military vehicle at the front and one at the rear, each maintaining a consistent distance relative to the other vehicles. The scene is set in a desert-like environment, with the road cutting through the barren landscape. The military vehicles are distinct due to their green color and boxy shape, typical of armored transport. The arrangement and movement of the vehicles imply a coordinated travel or escort scenario.",
    "Motion": "The video shows an aerial view of a road in a desert-like environment, with a convoy of vehicles, including a central truck featuring a white cargo area and a dark green cab, and several green-lit vehicles, moving forward. The green light on the vehicles gradually dims and eventually turns off as they continue to move. The vehicles maintain a steady formation and speed throughout the sequence.",
    "Scene": "The video, filmed by a drone, captures an aerial view of a straight, four-lane road with two lanes in each direction, cutting through a barren desert landscape. The setting is outdoors, with the road flanked by sandy terrain dotted with sparse vegetation. The time of day appears to be daytime, as indicated by the lighting. Vehicles, including a prominent white truck, travel along the road, with some vehicles highlighted by green markings. The scene is devoid of any architectural structures, emphasizing the isolation of the desert environment. The drone's perspective provides a clear, top-down view, showcasing the linearity of the road and the orderly movement of traffic amidst the vast, arid surroundings.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
