  "merged_caption": "This video features an extreme wide shot of a nighttime cityscape, with the scenery itself being the primary focus. The shot begins from a level-angle, deep focus perspective, showing the city as a vast expanse of blurred, multicolored lights scattered across the entire frame against a dark background. From an aerial perspective, the camera smoothly trucks and pans right over the night cityscape. It simultaneously tilts down, shifting from a level to a high angle, to reveal the streets below before zooming in for a closer look. As the drone pans right and tilts downward, the view comes into focus, revealing a street grid below. The shot resolves into a clearer high-angle view, where a multi-lane street in the middle ground runs diagonally from the upper-middle part of the frame toward the bottom right. This thoroughfare is illuminated by streetlights and the glowing signs of low-rise commercial buildings, with a few cars moving along its length. The streets are lined with low-rise buildings, some of which have illuminated signs and windows, casting a glow onto the dark asphalt. The camera slowly zooms in and focuses on a specific street, revealing a quiet urban scene with a few cars driving along the road. The area is illuminated by streetlights and the lights from surrounding buildings. The shot lacks a central subject, instead emphasizing the vast, atmospheric quality of the city at night, using the patterns of light and shadow to establish a sense of place and scale. The camera maintains a deep focus throughout, capturing the sprawling urban expanse as a glittering field of lights against the dark sky.",

    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone over a city at night initially shows a wide, blurry expanse of multicolored city lights against a black sky. As the drone pans right and tilts downward, the view comes into focus, revealing a street grid below. A main road with several lanes runs through the scene, populated by a few moving cars with white headlights and red taillights. The streets are lined with low-rise buildings, some of which have illuminated signs and windows, casting a glow onto the dark asphalt.",
    "Spatial": "This video features an extreme wide shot of a nighttime cityscape, with the scenery itself being the primary focus. The shot begins from a level-angle, deep focus perspective, showing the city as a vast expanse of blurred, multicolored lights scattered across the entire frame against a dark background. The camera then pans right and tilts downward, causing the scene to gradually sharpen. The shot resolves into a clearer high-angle view, where a multi-lane street in the middle ground runs diagonally from the upper-middle part of the frame toward the bottom right. This street is flanked by low-rise buildings, and a few cars are visible moving along it."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
