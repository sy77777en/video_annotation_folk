  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot capturing a bustling street scene at eye level with a level camera angle, using deep focus for a large depth of field. In the foreground, a group of schoolchildren in dark uniforms with backpacks is positioned near the center of the frame, close to a shop entrance, occupying the middle ground. They are framed collectively, with the shop's decorative elements like hanging ornaments visible above them. The camera, slightly unsteady with some shaking, trucks left, panning left to maintain alignment with the movement direction, revealing more of the street and additional pedestrians. In the background, several adults walk along the street, positioned towards the left and right, dressed in casual attire, including jackets and sweaters. Some wear face masks, and they are spread across the middle ground and background, contributing to the lively atmosphere. As the camera continues to move, more people are seen walking along the street, some in casual attire and others in traditional clothing. The street is lined with traditional Japanese shops, and the background shows a mix of buildings and greenery. The time of day is likely midday, with clear skies and scattered clouds. The environment features a mix of wooden and tiled structures, with one building displaying a sign adorned with Japanese characters. Trees with autumn foliage add a touch of color to the scene, and overhead power lines stretch across the sky, contributing to the urban atmosphere. The schoolchildren remain in the foreground, while the adults continue to move along the street, with some entering the frame from the right. The traditional Japanese architecture and decorative elements remain constant in the background, enhancing the urban setting.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
