  "merged_caption": "This medium full shot initially frames a man from behind in the foreground center as he kicks towards a muscular man standing in the middle ground, right of center. The muscular man, with short dark hair, wearing a black short-sleeved t-shirt and dark pants, opens his arms to absorb the kick, stepping back slightly without falling. The attacker, wearing dark pants, falls to the ground due to his own kick, his body landing on the floor in the bottom left foreground. This movement leaves the muscular man, who remains stationary, as the central focus in the middle ground, positioned to the right against a brick wall in the background. A green pipe runs horizontally across the top right of the frame. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, captures the scene from a low, ground-level angle, focused on the man in the midground with a shallow depth of field. The shot is unsteady, with noticeable shaking and minor, unintentional movement. The scene is set within a dimly lit, industrial interior, characterized by an exposed brick wall on the right. The atmosphere is dark and hazy, with a strong, low-angle light source from the right illuminating dust particles in the air and casting deep shadows. The overall lighting creates a stark contrast between illuminated areas and the surrounding darkness. The muscular man dusts off his chest and looks down at the person on the ground.",

    "Camera": "From a low, ground-level angle, the camera is focused on the man in the midground with a shallow depth of field. The shot is unsteady, with noticeable shaking and minor, unintentional movement.",
    "Subject": "A muscular man with short dark hair, wearing a black short-sleeved t-shirt and dark pants, is the main subject. Another man, initially seen from the back wearing dark pants, attempts to kick the muscular man to the ground with both feet but ends up falling to the floor himself. The muscular man remains standing and looks down at the man on the ground.",
    "Motion": "A man, seen from behind, jumps and kicks with both feet toward a muscular man. The muscular man opens his arms to absorb the kick, stepping back slightly without falling. The attacker falls to the ground due to his own kick, and the muscular man dusts off his chest and looks down at the person on the ground.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set within a dimly lit, industrial interior, characterized by an exposed brick wall on the right. A green pipe runs horizontally across the upper portion of the wall. The atmosphere is dark and hazy, with a strong, low-angle light source from the right illuminating dust particles in the air and casting deep shadows. The overall lighting creates a stark contrast between illuminated areas and the surrounding darkness.",
    "Spatial": "This medium full shot initially frames a man from behind in the foreground center as he kicks towards another man standing in the middle ground, right of center. The man in the foreground then falls, his body landing on the floor in the bottom left foreground. This movement leaves the second man, who remains stationary, as the central focus in the middle ground, positioned to the right against a brick wall in the background. A green pipe runs horizontally across the top right of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
