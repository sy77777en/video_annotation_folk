  "merged_caption": "This wide shot frames a man, seen from the back, wearing a light-colored suit jacket and matching trousers with a white hoodie underneath, playing a metallic silver drum set with gold or brass-colored cymbals, positioned centrally in the middle ground on a dark, textured rooftop. The dark rooftop extends from the foreground into the middle ground where the man is situated. In the background, various buildings of different heights and styles are visible under an overcast, greyish-white sky, filling the top portion in the far background. The camera is positioned at hip level, maintaining a level angle while incorporating a Dutch angle that varies as the camera rolls counterclockwise. Throughout the video, deep focus is consistently maintained, though the rolling movement of the camera causes the edges to appear blurry in contrast to the center, which remains in focus. The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking. From a seated position, the man's arms move up, down, and side-to-side in a rhythmic motion as he strikes various parts of the drum set, while the tail of his suit appears to flutter, possibly due to the wind. The camera's counterclockwise roll causes the positions of the buildings in the background to shift, enhancing the dynamic feel of the scene. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, with a Dutch angle tilt that varies throughout the video, capturing the rhythmic motion of the man's drumming and the subtle movements of his attire.",

    "Subject": "A man, seen from the back, wears a light-colored suit jacket and matching trousers, with a white hoodie underneath, such that the hood is visible at the back of his neck. He is seated and actively playing a metallic silver drum set that includes gold or brass-colored cymbals.",
    "Motion": "From a seated position, the man's arms move up, down, and side-to-side in a rhythmic motion as he strikes various parts of the drum set, while the tail of his suit appears to flutter, possibly due to the wind.",
    "Scene": "The video depicts an outdoor urban scene. A person in a light blue suit plays a silver drum set on a dark, textured rooftop. In the background, various buildings of different heights and styles are visible under an overcast, greyish-white sky.",
    "Spatial": "This wide shot frames a man playing a drum set, positioned centrally in the middle ground. The dark, textured rooftop occupies the bottom half of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground where the man is situated. In the background, various buildings are visible, with their positions shifting due to the camera's counterclockwise roll, and an overcast sky fills the top portion in the far background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, with a Dutch angle tilt that varies throughout the video."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
