  "merged_caption": "In a 2D animated scene, an ambulance is centered in the frame, with an anthropomorphic green crocodile visible in the driver's seat. The crocodile wears a small white medic's hat with a red cross on the front. The vehicle is a white van with a red horizontal stripe running along its side, a red cross symbol on a side panel, and a light bar with distinct red and blue sections on the roof. A road runs along the bottom of the frame, while stylized, light green rolling hills and simple, darker green trees with brown trunks are visible behind the ambulance, occupying the middle and upper portions of the frame. The ambulance remains stationary as the background scrolls from right to left to simulate movement. The camera smoothly tracks to the right, following the cartoon alligator as it drives the ambulance from left to right across the screen. The crocodile is initially shown with its eyes open, then closes and reopens them as the vehicle continues to move forward. The crocodile's head moves slightly as it steers. The setting is outdoors during the daytime, and the camera is positioned at the subject's height.",

    "Scene": "In a 2D animated scene, a white ambulance with a red horizontal stripe and a red cross on its side travels along a dark gray road. The vehicle, which has a red and blue siren on its roof, moves from left to right. Through the window, a green cartoon alligator wearing a small white hat with a red cross can be seen driving. The setting is outdoors during the daytime, with a background composed of stylized, light green rolling hills and simple, darker green trees with brown trunks.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
