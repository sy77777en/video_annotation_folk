  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot captured at the subjects' level, a large volume of turbulent, bluish water and shattered ice erupts from the left side of the frame, splashing across the middle ground in a formal dining hall with dark green curtains, a lit chandelier, and classical columns. In the foreground, a person is visible in profile, wearing a red short-sleeve shirt over a white collared shirt and dark pants, quickly jumping from the center of the frame toward the right. The camera, positioned at a smooth, hip-level angle, maintains a shallow depth of field, focusing on the man at the table in the midground. As the wave hits, the man, fair-skinned with short reddish-brown hair and dressed in a red long-sleeve shirt, stands slightly, leaning to the left to dodge the water and raising a dark rectangular object to shield his head. Meanwhile, another individual dressed entirely in dark clothing, seated in front of him, bends down, attempting to hide under the table. The camera performs a slight, smooth downward movement, capturing the dynamics of the scene. A watermark for \"MOVIECLIPS.COM\" is present in the bottom left corner.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
