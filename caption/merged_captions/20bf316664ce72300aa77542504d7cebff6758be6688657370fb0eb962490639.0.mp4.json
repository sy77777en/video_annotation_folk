  "merged_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a traditional Korean pavilion situated within a lush, tree-filled landscape. The pavilion occupies the central area of the frame, positioned slightly towards the bottom due to its placement on a stone platform. It is in the middle ground, with the surrounding trees forming the background. The pavilion's ornate roof and red columns are clearly visible, extending from the center-left to the center-right of the frame. A red-and-blue lantern hangs from a thin string on the right side of the frame, located in the foreground. Parts of leaves hang down in the foreground, adding depth to the scene. The trees and foliage fill the background, creating a dense canopy that frames the pavilion. Sunlight filters through the leaves, casting dappled light across the scene. The camera remains stationary throughout the video, maintaining a consistent perspective at eye level relative to the pavilion. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial position of the elements within the frame. The video is shot from an eye-level height with a low angle, looking up. It features a deep focus technique, capturing the entire scene in sharp detail. The camera remains completely static throughout. The pavilion's roof and columns are adorned with detailed patterns, and a traditional Korean lantern is suspended from a thin string to the right of the frame, in front of the pavilion. Throughout the frames, the leaves of the trees surrounding the pavilion are gently swaying, indicating a light breeze. The pavilion is elevated on a wooden platform and supported by deep red columns, topped with a gracefully curved tiled roof. Its intricate eaves and beams are adorned with vibrant patterns in green, blue, and orange, highlighting the ornate dancheong painting style unique to Korean architecture.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information.
