  "merged_caption": "This full shot begins with a man with a light complexion, dark hair, and a short beard, positioned horizontally across the center of the frame, diving headfirst into the turquoise water in the middle ground. He is shirtless and wears red, white, and blue striped swim trunks. The camera captures this high-angle, above-water shot with a speed ramp effect, transitioning between slower and slow motion. The camera is still but slightly unsteady, maintaining a shallow depth of field with the focus on the man in the foreground. As he descends, his body, held parallel to the surface, creates a significant splash upon entering the clear sea. His arms are extended out to his sides, and his legs are bent upwards, kicking up a splash as he enters the water. The man then fully submerges, causing a larger splash before disappearing entirely from view. The shot concludes with the resulting splash in the center of the frame, leaving only the water's surface visible. The scene is set against a simple backdrop of the expansive, bright blue water, with the sunlit expanse of calm, turquoise water providing a serene environment. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, capturing the dynamic motion and the tranquil setting in a cohesive visual narrative.",

    "Motion": "A man dives headfirst into the turquoise water, his body held parallel to the surface. As his upper body enters the water, it creates a splash. He then fully submerges, causing a larger splash before disappearing from view.",
    "Scene": "In a sunlit expanse of calm, turquoise water, a man wearing red, white, and blue striped swim trunks is captured mid-fall. Positioned horizontally just above the surface, his body creates a significant splash as he enters the clear sea. The scene is set against a simple backdrop of the expansive, bright blue water.",
    "Spatial": "This full shot begins with a man positioned horizontally across the center of the frame, diving directly into the water in the middle ground. As he descends, his body submerges, and he disappears entirely from view. The shot concludes with the resulting splash in the center of the frame, leaving only the water's surface visible. The camera is positioned at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
