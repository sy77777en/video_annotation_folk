  "merged_caption": "A close-up shot shows a faceless, mannequin-like humanoid figure positioned in the center of the frame and the foreground. The figure has a smooth, silver, and featureless head with a pearlescent sheen and is dressed in a white, collared dress shirt and a matching white tie. It is oriented frontally but slightly to the right. The scene is set in an indoor environment with a two-toned background, divided horizontally with a dark section occupying the top of the frame and a lighter gray section at the bottom. The figure stands centrally, illuminated by soft, cool-toned lighting. The camera is positioned at the subject's level and uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the faceless figure in sharp focus. It is a slow, eye-level shot from a level angle that moves forward slightly with a slight shake. Throughout the video, the mannequin-like figure remains completely still. An overlay of white text is present at the bottom left, reading, \"[4]\".",

    "Subject": "The video features a chest-up view of a faceless, mannequin-like humanoid figure. The figure has a smooth, silver, and featureless head with a pearlescent sheen. It is dressed in a white, collared dress shirt and a matching white tie, and it is positioned facing slightly to the right, in addition to facing forward.",

    "Scene": "In an indoor setting with a two-toned background, a silver, faceless figure stands centrally. The background is divided horizontally, with a dark upper portion and a lighter gray lower portion. The figure, which resembles a mannequin, is dressed in a white collared shirt and a matching white tie. The scene is illuminated by soft, cool-toned lighting.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
