  "merged_caption": "This close-up shot focuses on a person with light skin, wearing a white long-sleeved shirt over a light-colored top, holding a small, white, ribbed ramekin in the top-center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. Directly below, a white bowl containing red raspberries and dark blueberries sits in the center of the frame, also in the middle ground, nestled within a bright orange, square-shaped container with rounded corners and a white inner rim. The kitchen environment is visible in the softly out-of-focus background. Captured from a hip-level angle, the shot effectively uses a shallow depth of field to focus on the bowl of fruit, the ramekin, and the person's hands. The slightly unsteady handheld camera moves back and then forward, maintaining focus on the person's hands as they use their fingers to sprinkle the contents of the ramekin, which appear to be seeds or grains, onto the berries below. As the topping falls onto the fruit, the word \"FREE\" appears in large, white, sans-serif letters in the center of the frame, superimposed over the bowl and hands.",

    "Scene": "In an indoor kitchen setting, a person in a white shirt stands at a light-colored countertop preparing a meal. They hold a small, white, ribbed ramekin and sprinkle its contents onto a white plate filled with raspberries and blueberries. The plate rests inside a square, orange container. In the background, the kitchen environment is softly out of focus. An overlay with the word \"FREE\" in a large, white, sans-serif font appears in the center of the scene.",
    "Spatial": "This close-up shot focuses on a person's hands holding a white ramekin in the top-center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. Directly below, a white bowl containing berries sits in the center of the frame, also in the middle ground, nestled within a square orange container.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
