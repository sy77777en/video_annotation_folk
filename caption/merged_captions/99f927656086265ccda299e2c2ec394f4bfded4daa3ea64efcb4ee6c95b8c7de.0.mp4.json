  "merged_caption": "In an extreme wide shot, two people pulling a small, dark sled are positioned in the center of the frame. A snow-covered expanse fills the foreground and middle ground, with a dense forest line in the background and an overcast sky occupying the top of the frame. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, smoothly tracks the two individuals from the side, moving rightward to follow them as they walk in unison from left to right across the vast, snow-covered frozen lake. The person on the right of the frame wears a bright yellow jacket, dark pants, and a green hat, while the person on the left, walking slightly behind, is dressed in a brown jacket, dark pants, and a red hat. Together, they pull a small, dark, rectangular sled that glides smoothly behind them. In the first part of the video, they pause together for a moment, and the camera pauses in sync with them. The person in the yellow jacket walks slightly ahead of the person in the brown jacket as they maintain a steady pace across the flat expanse. The ground is uniformly white with snow, marked only by faint tracks. The distant shoreline is defined by a dense forest of dark pine and bare deciduous trees, enhancing the sense of isolation and vastness. The eye-level, level-angle shot with deep focus keeps the entire winter landscape sharp, capturing the serene and expansive environment as the two figures, relatively small within the vast landscape, continue their journey across the frozen lake.",

The camera smoothly tracks two people from the side, moving rightward to follow them as they walk across the frozen, snow-covered lake, pausing in sync with them when they stop during the first half of the video.",
    "Subject": "Two people walk across a flat, snow-covered surface. The person on the right of the frame wears a bright yellow jacket, dark pants, and a green hat. The person on the left of the frame, walking slightly behind, is dressed in a brown jacket, dark pants, and a red hat. Together, they pull a small, dark, rectangular sled that follows them on the snow.",
    "Motion": "Two people walk in unison from left to right across a vast, snow-covered frozen lake. They jointly pull a small, dark sled, which glides smoothly behind them. In the first part of the video, they pause together for a moment. The person in the yellow jacket walks slightly ahead of the person in the brown jacket as they maintain a steady pace across the flat expanse.",
    "Scene": "From a smooth, sweeping perspective, a vast, snow-covered frozen lake unfolds under a pale, overcast sky. The distant shoreline is defined by a dense forest of dark pine and bare deciduous trees. Two figures, one wearing a yellow jacket, move across the expansive ice, pulling a small, dark sled. The ground is uniformly white with snow, marked only by faint tracks.",
    "Spatial": "In an extreme wide shot, two people pulling a small sled are positioned in the center of the frame. A snow-covered expanse fills the foreground and middle ground, with a dense forest line in the background and an overcast sky occupying the top of the frame. The camera moves as the two individuals walk at a steady pace from left to right across the middle ground, remaining relatively small within the vast landscape. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
