  "merged_caption": "The video begins with an extreme wide, low-angle shot of a Black man with short hair and facial hair standing on a balcony in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. He wears a black jacket with white text printed on the chest and shoulders, along with light-colored pants. The building's concrete overhang occupies the top of the frame, with the sky visible in the background. The architecture is defined by an angular, beige concrete overhang that creates a covered balcony on the top floor, which is the third level. The building's facade consists of this textured concrete and a lower section of brown brick. The balcony features a solid, dark grey panel at its base with a black metal railing on top. A circular light fixture is mounted on the underside of the concrete overhang. The camera quickly and smoothly zooms in on the man, transitioning to a full shot while maintaining a low-angle perspective. He remains in the center, while the balcony railing he leans on moves into the foreground at the bottom of the frame. The man looks down toward the camera, resting one hand on the railing while using the other to gesture rhythmically, moving it up and down as he speaks or raps. His mouth is open as if he is speaking or rapping. The shot uses a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",

    "Subject": "A Black man with short hair and facial hair stands on a balcony, looking down toward the camera. He wears a black jacket with white text printed on the chest and shoulders, along with light-colored pants. He leans forward, resting one hand on the balcony's railing while waving with the other hand. His mouth is open as if he is speaking or rapping.",

    "Scene": "A low-angle shot looks up at the exterior of a multi-story building under an overcast sky. The architecture is defined by an angular, beige concrete overhang that creates a covered balcony on the top floor, which is the third level. The building's facade consists of this textured concrete and a lower section of brown brick. The balcony features a solid, dark grey panel at its base with a black metal railing on top. A man is visible standing on the balcony. A circular light fixture is mounted on the underside of the concrete overhang.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with an extreme wide, low-angle shot of a man standing on a balcony in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. The building's concrete overhang occupies the top of the frame, with the sky visible in the background. The camera then zooms in, transitioning to a full shot of the man. In the final framing, he remains in the center, while the balcony railing he leans on moves into the foreground at the bottom of the frame, with the low-angle perspective maintained throughout."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
