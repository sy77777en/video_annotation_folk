  "merged_caption": "Initially, the scene is captured from a high-angle, tilted perspective, showing a full shot of a young man with a dark complexion and a lean, muscular build, centered in the foreground. He is shirtless and barefoot, wearing dark-colored board shorts with two red stripes on the side. The nose of the surfboard, featuring pink and purple markings, occupies the bottom foreground, while a breaking wave is on the left in the middle ground, and the open ocean with distant surfers is visible in the right background. The camera, positioned above the water on the front of the surfboard, begins at a high angle with mild barrel distortion, maintaining a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. The camera then rapidly pivots upwards, transitioning to an extreme low-angle full shot, creating a varying Dutch angle as it rolls with the board. In this final framing, the surfer is centered in the foreground, crouched over the camera and silhouetted against the bright sky that now fills the background. His dark, wet hair, possibly styled in dreadlocks, moves with his motion as he maintains a low, athletic crouch on the surfboard, extending his arms to the sides for balance. A simple bracelet is visible on his right wrist, and a blue watch is on his left wrist. The camera smoothly tracks the surfer by panning to the right while tilting up and down in sync with the surfboard's motion on the wave. The surfboard remains at the bottom of the frame, as the wave and splashing water envelop the scene from the sides and foreground. Water splashes around his feet and body as he rides the wave, and the sun creates a bright, backlit silhouette against the blue sky dotted with white clouds.",

    "Camera": "This video is shot with mild barrel distortion.

    "Subject": "A young man with a dark complexion and a lean, muscular build is captured from a low-angle perspective with the camera fixed on the surfboard. He is shirtless and barefoot, wearing dark-colored board shorts with two red stripes on the side. His dark, wet hair, possibly styled in dreadlocks, moves with his motion. He maintains a low, athletic crouch on the surfboard, extending his arms to the sides for balance. A simple bracelet is visible on his right wrist, and a blue watch is on his left wrist. Water splashes around his feet and body as he rides the wave.",
    "Motion": "From a low-angle perspective fixed to the surfboard, a surfer rides a wave. He maintains a low crouch, extending his arms for balance as he maneuvers the board. The camera's view tilts and rotates with his movements, at one point becoming backlit and silhouetting him against the bright sky as he carves along the wave and water splashes around him.",
    "Scene": "A dynamic POV shot from a camera mounted on a surfboard captures the exhilarating experience of riding a wave on a bright, sunny day. Initially, the perspective is high, looking down from the nose of the board, before transitioning to a low angle, looking up. The board features pink and purple markings, and the surrounding ocean is a vibrant mix of turquoise water and churning white foam from the breaking wave. Above, a blue sky is dotted with white clouds, and the sun creates a bright, backlit silhouette. In the distance, across the vast expanse of water, other surfers appear as small figures. Water splashes and sprays across the lens as the board glides through the water.",
    "Spatial": "Initially, the scene is captured from a high-angle, tilted perspective, showing a full shot of the surfer in the center foreground. The nose of the surfboard occupies the bottom foreground, while a breaking wave is on the left in the middle ground, and the open ocean with distant surfers is visible in the right background. The camera then rapidly pivots upwards, transitioning to an extreme low-angle full shot. In this final framing, the surfer is centered in the foreground, crouched over the camera and silhouetted against the bright sky that now fills the background. The surfboard remains at the bottom of the frame, as the wave and splashing water envelop the scene from the sides and foreground."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
