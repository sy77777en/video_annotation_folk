  "merged_caption": "This is a wide shot of an architectural interior with no main subject. The tiled floor extends from the foreground to the background, occupying the lower half of the frame. A tiled column is positioned on the left, where it meets a wall. The wall on the left extends from the foreground to the background. The upper half of the frame is filled by the white wall in the background, which features a series of tall, glowing, capsule-shaped windows with rounded tops and bottoms positioned in the center and right. The lower portion of the walls is finished in a contrasting dark, textured material. The camera is positioned at a level angle, looking into the space and emphasizing the architectural lines and depth, with a slight pan to the right. This very smooth, eye-level shot features the only minor movement as a slight pan upward and rightward. The camera maintains a level angle and uses a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The video exhibits mild barrel distortion, causing straight lines near the edges to bow slightly outward. The space is defined by white tiled floors and walls, with the focus entirely on the stark, clean geometry and liminal atmosphere of the environment itself. The composition emphasizes the architectural lines rather than a specific focal point. The only movement is the slight rightward panning of the camera, capturing the minimalist, modern interior. An empty indoor room features a floor and upper walls covered in a grid of small, white square tiles. The row of tall, narrow windows emits a bright, diffuse white light into the space, enhancing the sterile, minimalist interior.",

    "Motion": "This video is a scenery shot of a minimalist, modern interior. The scene features a room with white tiled floors and walls, a darker textured wainscoting, and several tall, glowing, capsule-shaped windows. The only movement is the slight rightward panning of the camera.",
    "Scene": "An empty indoor room features a floor and upper walls covered in a grid of small, white square tiles. The lower half of the walls is finished with a dark, textured material. In the corner, a tiled column meets a wall. A row of tall, narrow windows with rounded tops and bottoms emits a bright, diffuse white light into the space.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
