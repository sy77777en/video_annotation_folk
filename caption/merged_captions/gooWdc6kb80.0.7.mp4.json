  "merged_caption": "A medium shot frames a light-skinned man with dark hair, a short beard, and black-rimmed glasses in the center middle ground, seated behind a wooden table that occupies the foreground. He wears a grey t-shirt with a muted floral pattern. Initially, a collapsed pile of light-colored wooden Jenga blocks lies in the bottom right foreground, with two large, white keyboard keys labeled \"Ctrl\" and \"Z\" on the bottom left. The camera is completely static, positioned at a level, eye-level angle, using a shallow focus with the Jenga blocks in sharp focus while the man is slightly out of focus. The man's hand moves over the keys as the scattered blocks on the right move in reverse, reassembling themselves into a standing tower in the center foreground. Once the tower is built, the man moves his hand from the bottom left to the center, carefully pulls a single block from a lower level, lifts it, suspends it above the top of the tower, and then releases it, allowing it to fall into place. The scene is set against a solid black background, and the camera remains stationary at the subject's level throughout the scene.",

    "Camera": "This time-reversed video shows a collapsed Jenga tower reassembling itself. The camera is completely static, positioned at a level, eye-level angle. A shallow focus is used, with the Jenga blocks on the table in sharp focus while the man is slightly out of focus.",
    "Subject": "A light-skinned man with dark hair, a short beard, and black-rimmed glasses sits at a wooden table, wearing a grey t-shirt with a muted floral pattern. In front of him, a collapsed pile of wooden Jenga blocks is shown reassembling itself into a tall, complete tower. To the left of the tower sit two large, white keyboard keys, one labeled \"Ctrl\" and the other \"Z.\" The man puts his hand over these keys as the tower rebuilds, and once it is standing, he reaches out to pull a block from the bottom of the structure, releases it, and it moves to the top.",
    "Motion": "A collapsed pile of wooden blocks on a table moves in reverse, reassembling itself into a standing tower. A man, sitting behind the table, puts his hand over two large keyboard keys during the reassembly. After the tower is complete, he carefully pulls a single block from a lower level, lifts it, suspends it above the top of the tower, and then releases it, allowing it to fall into place.",
    "Scene": "Against a solid black background, a Jenga tower made of light-colored wooden blocks is shown reassembling itself from a collapsed pile into a fully constructed tower on a dark brown wooden table. To the left of the tower sit two white keyboard keys, one with \"Ctrl\" and the other with \"Z\" printed on them. A man wearing glasses and a patterned t-shirt is seated at the table, and once the tower is complete, he reaches out to pull a block from the bottom of the structure, releases it, and it falls to the top.",
    "Spatial": "A medium shot frames a man in the center middle ground, seated behind a wooden table that occupies the foreground. Initially, a collapsed pile of Jenga blocks lies in the bottom right foreground, with two large keyboard keys on the bottom left. The man's hand puts over the keys as the scattered blocks on the right move in reverse, rising to form a complete tower in the center foreground. Once the tower is built, the man moves his hand from the bottom left to the center, pulls a block from the lower part of the tower, and releases it onto the top. The camera remains stationary at the subject's level throughout the scene."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
