  "merged_caption": "This video is an extreme wide scenery shot of the historic walled city of Dubrovnik, Croatia, captured by a drone during daylight. The densely packed buildings with orange terracotta tiled roofs dominate the frame, extending from the bottom left, through the center, to the top left, all situated in the middle ground. Grey stone fortifications surround this city, visible in the foreground and middle ground, with a notable cylindrical stone tower positioned in the bottom-right center foreground. The deep blue waters of the Adriatic Sea are located in the top right corner of the background. A prominent red structure stands in the bottom right middle ground, near green vegetated areas, including some courtyards. Roads with vehicles are present in the bottom left and bottom right, extending across the foreground at the bottom of the frame. The camera is positioned high above, offering an aerial, high-angle view of the scene with deep focus keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera performs a minor, smooth upward tilt, enhancing the view of the orange-roofed buildings and grey stone fortifications. The city is bordered on one side by the sea, and green vegetation is visible both outside and inside the city walls. A watermark is overlaid in the top left corner, though its exact text is unclear. The focus is on capturing the expansive scale and architectural character of the historic walled city, emphasizing the overall environment and atmosphere rather than a specific object or individual.",

    "Scene": "A drone-captured video provides an aerial view of the historic walled city of Dubrovnik, Croatia, during daylight. This outdoor scene showcases a dense cluster of buildings with orange terracotta tiled roofs, surrounded by light-colored stone or stucco walls, all enclosed by imposing grey stone fortifications. A notable cylindrical stone tower is part of these defenses. The city is bordered on one side by the deep blue waters of the Adriatic Sea. Green vegetation is visible both outside and inside the city walls, including some courtyards. In the lower right, a prominent red structure is situated near a green area. A watermark is overlaid in the top left corner, though its exact text is unclear.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
