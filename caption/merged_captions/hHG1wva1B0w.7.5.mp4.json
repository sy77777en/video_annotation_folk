  "merged_caption": "In a smooth dynamic medium shot, a red, human-like figure sits motionless at a table in the middle ground, positioned in the center-right of the frame. The table occupies the center of the frame, also in the middle ground. On the left side of the table is a stack of books, with a small white cup to its right and scattered papers positioned more to the right and closer to the camera. The scene is set indoors in a room resembling a library or study, with dark wood bookshelves filled with books lining the back wall. In the background, a large bookshelf is on the right, a window with a patterned design is on the left, and a smaller bookshelf is on the far left. The floor is tiled in a dark gray and light gray checkered pattern. The camera begins at a high angle, looking down at the scene, and executes a slow and smooth counterclockwise arc around the red figure at the table, moving slightly downward and slightly tilting up before it achieves a level angle. A shallow depth of field is used, keeping the focus on the midground where the figure is seated. Text overlays are present at the bottom of the screen, with \"June 7th, 1977\" gradually appearing from left to right on the left and \"Pitkin County Courthouse, Aspen, Colorado\" appearing all at once on the right. After a few seconds, all text fades out simultaneously. Another text overlay showing \"[2,19]\" is in the bottom left corner throughout the video. The figure's posture remains consistent, suggesting a focused or contemplative state, and the setting and objects suggest an environment conducive to study or work.",

    "Subject": "The video features a red, human-like figure sitting at a table in a library setting. The figure is positioned on a chair, generally facing to the left of the screen. The table in front of the figure holds several items, including a stack of books, a small white cup, and scattered papers. The background includes bookshelves filled with books and a window with a patterned design. The figure's posture remains consistent, suggesting a focused or contemplative state. The setting and objects suggest an environment conducive to study or work.",
    "Motion": "The red, human-like figure remains completely motionless while seated at the table throughout the video.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set indoors in a room resembling a library or study, with dark wood bookshelves filled with books lining the back wall. A large window is on the left, and the floor is tiled in a dark gray and light gray checkered pattern. There is another smaller bookshelf on the left, also full of books. In the center of the room, a red, slightly reflective figure sits in a gray chair at a light-colored wooden table. On the table are a stack of books, a small white cup, and several scattered papers. Text overlays are present at the bottom of the screen, with \"June 7th, 1977\" gradually appearing from left to right on the left and \"Pitkin County Courthouse, Aspen, Colorado\" appearing all at once on the right.

    "Spatial": "In a smooth dynamic medium shot, a red figure sits at a table in the middle ground, positioned in the center-right of the frame. The table occupies the center of the frame, also in the middle ground. On the left side of the table is a stack of books, with a cup to its right and scattered papers positioned more to the right and closer to the camera. In the background, a large bookshelf is on the right, a window is on the left, and a smaller bookshelf is on the far left. The camera executes a smooth arc movement, moving downward while tilting up, transitioning from a high angle to nearly the subject's eye level. Text appears at the bottom of the frame, with \"June 7th, 1977\" in the bottom left and \"Pitkin County Courthouse, Aspen, Colorado\" in the bottom right, before both fade out."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
