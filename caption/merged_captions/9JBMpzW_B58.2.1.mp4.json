  "merged_caption": "This video is an extreme wide scenery shot captured from a level-angle perspective on a massive container ship navigating the open ocean at night. The bow of the ship, with its stacked containers, extends from the bottom foreground to the bottom-center middle ground, creating a symmetrical V-shape that directs the viewer's gaze toward the center. The dark ocean stretches from the middle ground to the background, reaching a central horizon line. Above, the cloudy night sky dominates the top half of the frame, where faint stars are visible. The camera, positioned high between overhead and aerial level, moves forward quickly and smoothly with the ship, capturing the scene with a deep focus and mild barrel distortion. Throughout the shot, clouds move rapidly across the sky in a time-lapse, and a golden object along with several green and white objects streak horizontally through the middle portion of the frame before fading. The faint lights visible on the horizon are from other ships on the sea. As the ship advances, distant lights glimmer on the horizon, and a golden light can be seen passing by, along with several green and white luminous objects. The composition emphasizes the immense scale of the environment and the solitary feeling of being at sea. Watermarks for the social media handles 'JEFFREY.HK' and 'JEFFHK' are overlaid at the bottom right of the screen.",

    "Camera": "This is a greatly accelerated time-lapse video shot from a high position on a cargo ship, between overhead and aerial level, looking forward at a level angle. The camera moves forward quickly and smoothly with the ship, capturing the scene with a deep focus and mild barrel distortion.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a dramatic maritime scenery shot, captured in a time-lapse from the bow of a massive container ship navigating the open ocean at night. The perspective looks out over stacks of colorful shipping containers toward the dark, expansive sea under a cloudy, star-dusted sky. As the clouds scud rapidly overhead, distant lights glimmer on the horizon, and as the ship advances, a golden light can be seen passing by, along with several green and white luminous objects. The composition emphasizes the immense scale of the environment and the solitary feeling of being at sea. The vastness of the ocean and the dynamic sky are the true focus, rather than any single object.",
    "Motion": "This video presents a stunning time-lapse scenery shot from the bow of a large container ship sailing on the open ocean at night. The vessel itself is loaded with shipping containers, and the faint lights visible on the horizon are from other ships on the sea.",
    "Scene": "From a high vantage point on a massive container ship at sea, this time-lapse video captures a nighttime journey. The camera looks forward over rows of colorful shipping containers stacked on the deck. The vast, dark ocean stretches out to the horizon under a cloudy night sky where faint stars are visible. As the ship moves forward, clouds drift rapidly overhead, and a golden-yellow light object passes by, accompanied by several green and white luminous objects. Overlaying the right side of the scene are watermarks for the social media handles 'JEFFREY.HK' and 'JEFFHK'.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
