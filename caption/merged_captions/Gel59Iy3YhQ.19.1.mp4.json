  "merged_caption": "This is a wide shot of a 2D gaming scene, captured from a side-view perspective, featuring two pixelated figures. A blue-armored figure, holding a weapon, is positioned at the bottom left, performing static shooting movements and primarily facing left. Initially, a green-hatted figure with light skin, wearing a red pointed hat and a red upper garment, is positioned on the left, slightly above the blue figure, jumping up and down on top of the blue-armored figure's head. The green figure's hands, legs, and weapon are off-white, while the hair, shoes, and arms are green. The blue-armored figure occasionally turns to the right to attack the green figure, taking damage from being stepped on. Eventually, the green figure jumps to the ground and moves from left to right, passing in front of the blue figure and continuing in that direction, while the blue-armored figure remains stationary, facing left, at the far left of the frame. The scene features a dark brick wall with a faint brick texture, framed by two vertical, brown-striped pillars, and a purple, scalloped structure hanging from the ceiling between the pillars. The environment includes a floor and ceiling made of brown brick. A heads-up display is overlaid at the very top of the frame, showing \"MAGIC-5\" and \"LIFE-6\" with corresponding status bars, alongside \"NEXT 0542/2000\". The camera is static, positioned at the subjects' height, with no movement throughout the scene.",

    "Subject": "The video features two pixelated figures. A figure with light skin wears a red pointed hat and a red upper garment, holding an off-white weapon. The hands and legs are off-white, while the hair, shoes, and arms are green. This figure is initially positioned above the other character, jumping on top of it before landing and moving from left to right. Another figure is depicted in blue and silver metallic armor, primarily facing to the left.",

    "Scene": "A side-view gaming video, where the camera is placed to the side capturing the scene in profile, is set within an indoor, 2D level. The environment features a floor and ceiling made of brown brick. The background is a dark, black wall with a faint brick texture, framed by two vertical, brown-striped pillars. A purple, scalloped structure hangs from the ceiling between the pillars. Two small, pixelated characters occupy the space, with the green character standing on top of the blue character. A heads-up display is overlaid at the top, showing \"MAGIC-5\" and \"LIFE-6\" with corresponding status bars, alongside \"NEXT 0542/2000\".",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
