  "merged_caption": "This is a medium shot focusing on a man with light skin and a brown beard, wearing a black ski helmet and large black ski goggles, positioned centrally in the foreground, captured from a selfie point of view with the camera held in his right hand. He is dressed in a black and white jacket, with white sleeves and a black middle section, along with black gloves. The man is seated on a black ski lift chair that occupies the bottom portion of the frame, also in the foreground, with his left arm resting along the back of the chair. Bare trees are visible on the left side in the middle ground. The background, seen primarily in the center and right of the frame, consists of a snowy ski resort landscape, including slopes, buildings, and other chairlift structures under an overcast sky. The camera is positioned at the subject's level and moves backward and upward along the track, maintaining deep focus. It leads the man on the chairlift from the front with slightly unsteady movement, making it challenging to discern whether the camera height is overhead or aerial. The man looks directly at the camera, smiling as he continuously talks. Occasionally, he glances to his left to take in the scenery but quickly turns back to face the camera and continues speaking. The perspective suggests upward movement on the lift, offering a view of the resort base area and surrounding wooded hills. The framing remains static throughout the clip, capturing the man as he rides the chairlift at a snowy ski resort during the daytime, with the dark ski goggles reflecting slightly.",

    "Subject": "The video features a man with light skin and a brown beard, wearing a black ski helmet and large black ski goggles that cover his eyes.

    "Motion": "The man is seated on a ski lift, surrounded by a snowy landscape and trees. He is wearing a black helmet, black ski goggles, and a black and white jacket.

    "Scene": "A selfie POV shot captures a man riding a chairlift at a snowy ski resort during the daytime. The man wears a black helmet, dark ski goggles reflecting slightly, a black jacket with white long sleeves, and black gloves, with his left arm resting on the black padded safety bar of the chairlift. Below and behind him, the snow-covered landscape features bare trees, visible ski slopes with distant skiers, resort buildings, and other chairlift structures under an overcast sky. The perspective suggests upward movement on the lift, offering a view of the resort base area and surrounding wooded hills.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
