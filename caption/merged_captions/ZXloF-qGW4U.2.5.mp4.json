  "merged_caption": "A close-up shot frames a man with short, dark hair and some stubble in the center-right of the foreground, wearing a dark, high-collared coat. His face, which has what appear to be cuts or blood on the forehead and cheek, is illuminated by a strong, deep blue light that casts a blue hue over his skin. The scene is set outdoors at night, enveloped in darkness and bathed in a strong, monochromatic blue light. In the blurry background, a few faint, out-of-focus lights hint at a distant cityscape. Initially, the man looks slightly downward with a somber expression, and then he slowly lifts his head, shifting his gaze to look upward. The camera remains static and positioned at the subject's level throughout the shot, using a shallow depth of field to keep the focus on the man in the foreground.",

    "Camera": "This is a static, low-angle shot filmed from eye level. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the focus on the man in the foreground.",
    "Subject": "A man with short, dark hair and some stubble is shown in a close-up. His face, which has what appear to be cuts or blood on the forehead and cheek, is illuminated by a strong, deep blue light that casts a blue hue over his skin. He is wearing a dark, high-collared coat. His expression is somber as he looks slightly downward before looking upward.",
    "Motion": "The man slowly lifts his head, shifting his gaze from looking slightly downward to looking upward.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set outdoors at night, enveloped in darkness and bathed in a strong, monochromatic blue light. In the blurry background, a few faint, out-of-focus lights hint at a distant cityscape. The foreground is occupied by a man whose face, also cast in the deep blue hue, shows some cuts as he looks slightly upward.",
    "Spatial": "A close-up shot frames a man in the center-right of the foreground, with out-of-focus lights visible in the background. Initially, he looks slightly downward, and then he slowly tilts his head to look upward. The camera remains static and positioned at the subject's level throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
