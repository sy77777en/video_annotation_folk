  "merged_caption": "A full shot shows a 3D model of a translucent partition resembling the walls of a bathroom stall, positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. It stands on a glossy, reflective surface that extends seamlessly from the foreground into the background, mirroring its form against a dark backdrop. The partition is made of a frosted material, possibly representing glass or acrylic, and is shaped into a four-sided, open-topped enclosure with one of the front panels functioning as a door, connected by small, metallic-looking hinges. Initially, the entire structure is slightly elevated off the ground on small feet. The camera, positioned at a high angle, gracefully arcs counterclockwise around the partition, maintaining deep focus to ensure the entire stall remains in sharp detail. Around the six-second mark, the partition's design changes, with its legs disappearing so that the panels become flush with the reflective surface. The side panels and door extend downwards, closing the gap at the bottom to become flush with the surface of the floor. The camera's rotation continues, offering a comprehensive view of the object from multiple angles, creating the illusion of the structure slowly rotating clockwise, revealing its different angles as its reflection moves in unison on the glossy surface below. The view shifts to show the partition from multiple angles, with its reflection visible on the glossy surface below, though it is unclear whether the partition itself is rotating or if the camera is moving around it. The shot concludes with a subtle zoom out, and a white overlay text \"[9]\" is visible at the bottom left of the screen.",

    "Subject": "A 3D model of a bathroom stall partition is presented against a dark, reflective surface. The partition is made of a translucent, frosted material, possibly representing glass or acrylic, and is shaped into a four-sided, open-topped enclosure. One of the front panels functions as a door, connected by small, metallic-looking hinges. Initially, the entire structure is slightly elevated off the ground on small feet, but around six seconds into the video, the panels change, and the gaps that formed the legs are removed. The view shifts to show the partition from multiple angles, with its reflection visible on the glossy surface below, though it is unclear whether the partition itself is rotating or if the camera is moving around it.",
    "Motion": "A 3D model of a translucent bathroom stall partition is initially stationary, elevated slightly off a reflective surface. The side panels and door then extend downwards, closing the gap at the bottom to become flush with the surface of the floor. Throughout the video, the camera continuously moves counterclockwise around the stall, creating the illusion of the structure slowly rotating clockwise, revealing its different angles as its reflection moves in unison on the glossy surface below.",
    "Scene": "A 3D model of a three-sided, translucent partition with a hinged door is centered against a dark, gradient background. The partition, made of a frosted material, stands on a glossy, reflective surface that mirrors its form. The camera slowly rotates around the object, providing a comprehensive view. A white overlay text \"[9]\" is visible at the bottom left of the screen.",
    "Spatial": "A full shot shows a 3D model of a translucent partition resembling the walls of a bathroom stall, positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. It stands on a glossy, reflective surface that extends seamlessly from the foreground into the background, mirroring its form against a dark backdrop. The camera, positioned above the subject, slowly rotates counter-clockwise around the partition. Around the six-second mark, the partition's design changes, with its legs disappearing so that the panels become flush with the reflective surface. The camera's rotation continues, offering a comprehensive view of the object from multiple angles."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
