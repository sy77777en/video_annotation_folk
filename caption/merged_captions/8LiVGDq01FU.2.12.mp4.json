  "merged_caption": "This is a medium full shot featuring a person in a space suit positioned slightly left of the center in the foreground. The subject, wearing a helmet and a dark, padded jacket with light-colored stripes, faces towards the right side of the frame. The suit includes gloves and pants that match the jacket's color scheme, with white harness straps. The person is oriented with their back to the viewer, leaning slightly forward with arms extended, suggesting movement or interaction with something out of view. In the background, stacked horizontal layers fill the middle and far-left portions of the frame, while the right side also includes vertical stacked layers, creating a dense, library-like or data-storage appearance. The setting is a dimly lit, enclosed space with reflective surfaces, enhancing the futuristic and technical appearance of the scene. A reflective floor occupies the bottom of the frame. The camera is positioned at hip level with a level angle, focusing on the person in the middleground using a shallow depth of field. It moves slowly backward with slight unsteadiness and some shaking, gradually moving away from the background to provide a wider view of the surroundings. Lighting is predominantly dim, with isolated brighter areas illuminating parts of the background structures. The camera's backward movement reveals more of the industrial-like environment, characterized by its dark, abstract composition and reflective surfaces.",

    "Subject": "The video features a person wearing a space suit, characterized by a helmet and a dark, padded jacket with light-colored stripes. The suit includes gloves and pants that match the jacket's color scheme. The person is oriented with their back to the viewer, leaning slightly forward with arms extended, suggesting movement or interaction with something out of view.

    "Motion": "The video shows a person in a space suit standing in a dimly lit, industrial-like environment with reflective surfaces and stacked materials in the background. The person is leaning slightly forward with arms extended, suggesting they are either balancing or reaching out towards something. The camera gradually moves away from the background, providing a wider view of the surroundings.",
    "Scene": "The video shows an indoor setting characterized by a dark, abstract environment. The walls are composed of numerous stacked, horizontal layers with varying colors and textures, creating a dense, library-like or data-storage appearance. Lighting is predominantly dim, with isolated brighter areas illuminating parts of the background structures. A figure wearing a grey and white spacesuit, complete with a helmet, stands facing away from the viewer towards the right. The suit features a dark jacket over lighter pants and white harness straps. The figure's left arm is slightly outstretched.",
    "Spatial": "This is a medium full shot featuring a person in a spacesuit positioned slightly left of the center in the foreground. The subject faces towards the 右前方 side of the frame. In the background, stacked horizontal layers fill the middle and far-left portions of the frame, while the right side also includes vertical stacked layers. A reflective floor occupies the bottom of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level and moves backward during the clip."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
