  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a bird's eye view framing the upper portion of a light-colored figurine lying face-down, positioned in the center upper area of the frame on the floor (background plane). A large wooden structure dominates the bottom left foreground/middle ground, while another wooden structure partially obscures the figurine in the middle ground. Additional wooden structures are visible in the top left and top right middle ground/background. Numerous small, colorful objects are scattered across the floor, particularly concentrated around the figurine. The figurine is initially visible from the knee up, with its right arm extended outward and the left hand turned outward. The left lower leg is slightly raised, with the left foot resting on a wooden structure, and the head is facing downward to the right. The scene is set in an indoor environment with a tiled floor, well-lit by an artificial light source. As the camera moves smoothly upward, maintaining steadiness and deep focus with a large depth of field, the view expands to a full shot, revealing the entire figurine occupying the center-top area. The figurine is in a horizontal position, with shelf-like wooden structures covering parts of it, creating a layered effect. Scattered around the scene are small, colorful objects, adding texture to the setting. The spatial relationship between the figurine, the structures, and the scattered objects remains consistent, viewed from the same bird's eye perspective. The focus remains on the figurine and the messy surroundings, with added text present in the lower left corner, indicating additional information not part of the physical scene.",

    "Camera": "The video features an overhead-level camera at a bird's-eye view, looking directly down at the ground. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field, ensuring all elements remain sharp. The camera moves smoothly upward, maintaining steadiness throughout.",
    "Subject": "The video features a figurine lying in a prone position on the ground, partially obscured by wooden structures. The figurine is light-colored and initially visible from the knee up, with its right arm extended outward and the left hand turned outward. The left lower leg is slightly raised, with the left foot resting on a wooden structure, and the head is facing downward to the right. As the camera moves, the entire figure is revealed, showing it in a horizontal position. The wooden structures, which appear to be lattice-like, cover parts of the figurine, creating a layered effect. Scattered around the scene are small, colorful objects, adding texture to the setting. The focus remains on the figurine and the messy surroundings.",
    "Motion": "The video shows a figurine lying face-down on the ground, partially covered by wooden structures. The figurine is light-colored and visible from the knee up, with an arm extended outward. The entire figure is in a horizontal position, with shelf-like wooden structures covering parts of it, creating a layered effect. Scattered around the scene are small, colorful objects, adding texture to the setting.",
    "Scene": "The video depicts an indoor setting with a tiled floor, where a large, abstract sculpture resembling a human figure lies horizontally. Surrounding the figure are several wooden structures, possibly resembling shelves or crates, some of which are overturned or leaning. Scattered across the floor are small, colorful objects, adding a sense of disarray. The scene is well-lit, suggesting an artificial light source typical of an indoor environment. Added text is present in the lower left corner, indicating additional information not part of the physical scene.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
