  "merged_caption": "The video presents an extreme wide shot of a rural landscape, focusing on a church with a tall, pointed spire, positioned in the center of the frame. The church, constructed from stone with a traditional architectural style and a slate roof, is surrounded by a graveyard with neatly arranged headstones, primarily located in the top left and top center of the frame. Lush green trees are scattered throughout, with a prominent cluster in the bottom right, and open grassy spaces fill the remaining areas, contributing to the expansive feel. The video, filmed by a drone, begins with an aerial view of the church, showing its detailed structure and the surrounding graveyard. The camera maintains a consistent aerial perspective, positioned above the scene, offering a comprehensive view of the church and its surroundings. A dirt path runs from the church towards the graveyard, winding through the landscape. The surrounding area includes trees and some greenery, providing a natural border around the church and graveyard. The camera maintains a deep focus, capturing all elements sharply, and moves smoothly from left to right, providing a sweeping view of the scene with minimal shaking. The setting is a cemetery with visible paths and clusters of mature trees providing shade. The time of day is likely midday, as indicated by the bright, even lighting and clear skies. The emphasis is on the overall environment and the peaceful rural setting, rather than a specific object, highlighting the scale and tranquility of the landscape. The drone's aerial perspective offers a comprehensive view of the church and its surroundings, highlighting the orderly layout of the cemetery and the natural greenery that frames the scene.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
