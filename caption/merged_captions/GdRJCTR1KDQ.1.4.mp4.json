  "merged_caption": "In a full shot, a large, green-striped watermelon rests on a brown cardboard box, positioned in the center of the frame and the foreground, set against a background of blurred green foliage. The central scene is flanked by blurred vertical bars on the left and right sides of the frame. The camera is static and positioned at the subject's level, utilizing a speed ramp effect that transitions from an even slower motion to slow motion, maintaining an extremely shallow depth of field to keep the focus on the watermelon in the foreground. As the video progresses, the watermelon explodes in slow motion, with its top section bursting upwards and outwards. A fine mist of red pulp and juice erupts from the center, while the dark green rind shatters into large, pointed sections that peel back like the petals of a flower, revealing the red interior. Smaller fragments of the rind are sent flying away from the central point. The force of the explosion sends the red, pulpy flesh and juice spraying upwards and outwards in a fine mist. The scene captures the dynamic motion of the explosion, with the rind peeling away from the center and pieces of red flesh and mist being propelled upwards and outwards, creating a visually striking effect against the blurred green backdrop.",

    "Camera": "This static, level-angle shot showcases a speed ramp effect, transitioning from an even slower motion to slow motion, while an extremely shallow depth of field keeps the focus on the watermelon in the foreground.",
    "Subject": "A large, green-striped watermelon is shown in the process of exploding while resting on a brown cardboard box. The force of the explosion sends the red, pulpy flesh and juice spraying upwards and outwards in a fine mist. The dark green rind of the watermelon is shattered, with large, pointed sections peeling back like the petals of a flower, revealing the red interior.",
    "Motion": "A watermelon explodes in slow motion, with its top section bursting upwards and outwards. A fine mist of red pulp and juice erupts from the center, while the green rind shatters, causing large, pointed sections to peel back and smaller fragments to fly away.",
    "Scene": "In an outdoor setting against a backdrop of blurred green foliage, a watermelon resting on a brown cardboard box explodes in slow motion. Red flesh and a fine mist of juice erupt from the center, while the dark green rind shatters into large, pointed pieces that are sent flying outwards. The central scene is framed by vertical bars on the left and right, which are blurred extensions of the main video content.",
    "Spatial": "In a full shot, a watermelon on a cardboard box is positioned in the center of the frame and the foreground, set against a background of blurred green foliage. The central scene is flanked by blurred vertical bars on the left and right sides of the frame. As the watermelon explodes, its rind peels away from the center, while pieces of red flesh and mist are propelled upwards and outwards from this central point.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
