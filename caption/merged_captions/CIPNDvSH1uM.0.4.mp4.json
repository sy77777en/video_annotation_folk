  "merged_caption": "A close-up shot consistently frames a driver from the shoulders up, positioned in the center foreground, wearing a light-colored collared shirt. The car's A-pillar and side mirror are visible in the left foreground. Throughout the video, the camera remains static and at the subject's level, with a slightly unsteady, eye-level perspective. The camera trucks left, tracking the driver in the car from the side, maintaining a deep focus that keeps both the driver and the background scenery in clear view. The scene is set from the driver's side of a moving convertible during the daytime, traveling along a paved road. In the mid-ground, a wooden fence extends from the left to the right side of the frame throughout the video. In the background, trees and distant hills scroll from left to right under a pale blue sky, indicating the vehicle is in motion. The subject, initially appearing as a young boy with medium, wavy blond hair, undergoes a series of facial transformations while remaining seated and facing to his left, towards the camera. The face morphs into a child with medium, straight blond hair, then into a bald, pale-skinned creature with pointed ears, wide eyes, and a large, toothy grin. Next, it changes to resemble a sphynx cat with numerous wrinkles, followed by a reptilian-like being with reddish-brown, wrinkled skin, dark, narrow eyes, and a snout. Finally, the subject appears as a young man with wavy, medium-length blond hair. Despite these rapid transformations, the driver's position within the frame remains unchanged, and the background of green trees, distant rolling hills, and a wooden fence remains consistent throughout the sequence.",

    "Scene": "The scene is set from the driver's side of a moving convertible during the daytime. The vehicle travels along a paved road, with a background of green trees, distant rolling hills under a pale blue sky, and a wooden fence visible along the side of the road in the midground.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
