  "merged_caption": "This is a close-up shot where a person's hands are the central focus in the foreground. A person with light skin, wearing a light-colored apron, holds a bright yellow, bowl-shaped ceramic cup with a white interior in their left hand. The cup, filled with brown coffee, is held steady in the bottom center of the frame. In their right hand, which has light green painted fingernails, the person holds a small, stainless steel pitcher positioned on the left of the frame. From a high, eye-level angle, the camera looks down at the scene, with a shallow depth of field keeping the focus sharp on the yellow cup and the milk being poured. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady. The pitcher pours a stream of white, steamed milk from the upper left into the center of the cup. As the milk flows, the person gently wiggles the pitcher from side to side, causing the white milk to form a series of stacked, curved lines on the brown surface of the coffee, creating an intricate white pattern characteristic of latte art. The pattern develops into a series of stacked, curved lines. The hands, cup, and pitcher remain in their relative positions as the pattern develops. In the background, a light-colored apron fills the frame.",

    "Scene": "In an indoor setting, a person wearing a light-colored apron holds a round, yellow ceramic cup filled with brown coffee. Using their other hand, they pour white, steamed milk from a stainless steel pitcher into the cup. As the milk is poured, a white, layered pattern begins to form on the surface of the coffee. The person's fingernails are painted a light green color.",
    "Spatial": "This is a close-up shot where a person's hands are the central focus in the foreground.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
