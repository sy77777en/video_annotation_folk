  "merged_caption": "The video uses a wide shot to capture a cityscape with no main subject, focusing on the overall urban environment. At the start, the handheld camera is positioned at a pedestrian’s eye level, maintaining a level angle and looking straight ahead as it moves forward along a clean, urban sidewalk in a Japanese city during daytime. The sidewalk occupies the bottom and lower center, extending into the background, with an intersection in the right-center middle ground. On the right, a green metal pedestrian overpass with visible rivets and a sloped ramp rises from the bottom right foreground, while modern mid-rise buildings with glass, metal, and concrete surfaces in neutral tones line the left and stretch from the foreground to the background. Trimmed bushes and a small tree add greenery near a building entrance. As the camera advances, the overpass gradually moves out of view. A black van travels from left to right along the horizontal sidewalk, entering the middle ground at the center of the frame, while a large white truck moves along the right longitudinal road, transitioning from the middle ground to the background. Other vehicles, including black and white ones, move in an orderly fashion. Blue road signs with white Japanese text and directional arrows are mounted above the street, and traffic flows steadily. The sky is clear and blue with scattered clouds, and sunlight casts sharp shadows on the ground. The camera maintains a consistent height at street level throughout, emphasizing the perspective of someone walking through the city. It moves forward with a slight pan to the right at the end of the video, and the movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking. Deep focus is used, keeping all elements in the scene, including the sidewalk, buildings, and vehicles, sharply in focus.",

    "Subject": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing a vibrant urban environment characterized by modern buildings with clean lines and varied facades, a well-maintained sidewalk with tactile paving, and a busy street featuring vehicles such as a black van and a large white truck. The scene is bright and clear, with a blue sky and scattered clouds overhead, and signage in Japanese providing a sense of place. There is no main subject in the video; instead, the focus is on the overall atmosphere and scale of the city, emphasizing the interplay between architecture, infrastructure, and daily urban life rather than highlighting any specific object or individual.",
    "Motion": "This video depicts a city street scene on a clear day. The area features modern buildings, a sidewalk with tactile paving, and a road with numerous vehicles, including a black van and a truck, moving in an orderly fashion. The sky is bright blue with some clouds, and there are street signs and greenery visible.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves along a clean, urban sidewalk in a Japanese city during daytime. The environment is outdoors, with modern mid-rise buildings lining the street, their facades featuring glass, metal, and concrete surfaces in neutral tones. A green metal pedestrian overpass with visible rivets and a sloped ramp stands to the right, while trimmed bushes and a small tree add greenery near a building entrance. The sidewalk is paved with gray and beige tiles, some with tactile paving for accessibility. Blue road signs with white Japanese text and directional arrows are mounted above the street, and traffic flows steadily with black and white vehicles, including a van and a truck, visible at an intersection. The sky is clear and blue, and sunlight casts sharp shadows on the ground.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
