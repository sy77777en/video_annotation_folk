  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a level-angle medium shot focused on the legs of a person in the foreground, seen from the waist down, wearing black shorts, black socks, and red athletic shoes, positioned on the left side of the frame and moving toward the right. The camera, positioned at hip-level, moves unsteadily without a clear, discernible pattern, capturing the person's legs as they run across an outdoor, paved sports court during a sunny day. The greenish-gray surface is marked with worn yellow and white painted lines. In the middle ground, a woman with light skin, wearing a dark short-sleeved shirt and dark shorts, receives the soccer ball passed by the person in the foreground, while another player with long, brown-colored hair, dressed in a dark green shirt, runs further away. The camera captures the foreground player's movement from left to right, causing the composition to shift and transition into a full shot that reveals more of the players and the court. The player in the right foreground is closer to the camera, while the player in the left middle ground is farther from the camera. In the background, a long wall is covered with graffiti, and urban buildings and trees are visible beyond it. Bright sunlight casts long, dark shadows of people playing soccer across the pavement. The level-angle perspective captures the action at hip level, moving along with the players and the ball. The video is too blurry to determine the camera's focus, but it effectively conveys the dynamic interaction between the players and the environment.",

    "Camera": "From a hip-level, level-angle perspective, the camera moves unsteadily without a clear, discernible pattern. The video is too blurry to determine the camera's focus.",
    "Subject": "A person in the foreground, seen from the waist down, wears black shorts, black socks, and red athletic shoes. In the midground, a woman with light skin wears a dark short-sleeved shirt and dark shorts. In the distance, another person with long, brown-colored hair is dressed in a dark green shirt. A soccer ball is actively being passed between the players on the court.",
    "Motion": "From a level-angle perspective, a person's legs run across an outdoor court. In the mid-ground, a female athlete in a dark short-sleeve shirt receives the ball passed by the person in the foreground, while another player with long hair runs further away.",
    "Scene": "The scene takes place on an outdoor, paved sports court during a sunny day. The greenish-gray surface is marked with worn yellow and white painted lines. In the background, a long wall is covered with graffiti, and urban buildings and trees are visible beyond it. Bright sunlight casts long, dark shadows of people playing soccer across the pavement.

    "Spatial": "The video opens with a level-angle medium shot focused on the legs of a person in the foreground, positioned on the left side of the frame and moving toward the right. In the middle ground, two other players and a soccer ball are visible to the right of the center. A graffiti-covered wall spans the background. The camera captures the foreground player's movement from left to right, causing the composition to shift and transition into a full shot that reveals more of the players and the court. The player in the right foreground is closer to the camera, while the player in the left middle ground is farther from the camera. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
