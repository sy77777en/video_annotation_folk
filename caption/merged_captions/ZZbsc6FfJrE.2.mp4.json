  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot of a crowded, warmly lit shop during the day, featuring a large red counter in the foreground. On the counter, a brown clock-like figure with a smiling face and a pendulum, and a golden, three-armed candelabra with lit candles are positioned in the bottom center foreground next to stacks of small, white, round plates. In the middle ground, several people are visible, including a man in a white t-shirt with a black backpack and a man in a neon green tank top on the left, and a woman with long dark hair in a white top to the left of the counter. A young girl with a white headband looks over the counter, where stacks of white, round objects are displayed. To the right, a woman with blonde hair in a white tank top and sunglasses on her head is smiling. Other people are visible in the background, including a woman in a red and black plaid shirt. The camera, in an unsteady, eye-level shot, begins at a level angle and moves continuously forward, slightly downward, and to the left while tilting down, causing the view to become a high angle. Midway through the shot, it pans to the right, bringing the young girl into the center and the woman with blonde hair to the right. Additionally, a man in a brown trench coat with black-rimmed glasses and a woman in a pink outfit carrying a black backpack are among the people present. The background features reddish-brown wooden shelves and other individuals. The camera transitions from a wide shot to a close-up shot, making the girl and the blonde woman more prominent in the center and center-right middle ground, respectively. A framed portrait of a man in red clothing hangs on a distant wall.",

    "Motion": "The camera moves forward and to the left while tilting downward, capturing a crowded, themed room. Midway through the shot, it pans to the right. In the background, people stand and move around the space. In the midground, a young girl behind a counter looks forward, while a woman to her right turns her head and smiles as the camera passes.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character’s eyes, captures a scene inside a crowded, warmly lit shop during the day. The environment is defined by its reddish-brown wooden interior, featuring a large red counter in the foreground and tall, stocked shelving units in the background. On the counter, a brown clock-like figure with a face and a golden candelabra with three lit candles are positioned next to stacks of small, white, round plates. A framed portrait of a man in red clothing hangs on a distant wall. Various people are present throughout the space, with some standing near the counter and others browsing in the middle ground and background.",
    "Spatial": "The video opens with a wide shot of a crowded room, featuring a large red counter in the foreground. On the counter, a clock figure and a candelabra are positioned in the bottom center foreground. In the middle ground, several people are visible, including a man in a white shirt and a man in a fluorescent green shirt on the left, and a woman with dark hair to the left of the counter. As the camera moves forward and to the left while tilting downward, it pans to the right, bringing a young girl into the center and a woman with blonde hair to the right.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
