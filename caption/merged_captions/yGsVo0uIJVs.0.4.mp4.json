  "merged_caption": "A full shot captures a heavy, oblong metal door, similar in appearance to a vault or submarine hatch, positioned in the center of the frame. The door's surface is a dark, reddish-brown color, showing signs of rust and wear. A small circular porthole is located in the upper-center of the door, with a larger, circular wheel mechanism with six spokes directly below it in the center. A rectangular plaque displaying the words \"TOP SECRET\" in capital letters is situated in the lower-center of the door. The door is set within a thick, matching frame and flanked by dark, metallic walls with vertical, ribbed structures in the foreground on the left and right sides of the frame. The scene is illuminated by a strong, pulsating red light that rhythmically brightens and dims, bathing the door in a vivid glow. In the lower left corner of the screen, there is a very small white logo. The shot features a dolly zoom, where the camera smoothly moves forward while simultaneously zooming out from the red, \"TOP SECRET\" door. This is a level-angle shot with a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp as the camera movement creates a dynamic visual effect, enhancing the sense of depth and focus on the stationary door.",

    "Subject": "A heavy, oblong metal door, similar in appearance to a vault or submarine hatch, is bathed in a strong, pulsating red light. The door's surface is a dark, reddish-brown color, showing signs of rust and wear. It is designed with a small, circular porthole near its top and a larger, circular wheel mechanism with six spokes in its center. Directly below the wheel, a rectangular plaque is attached, displaying the words \"TOP SECRET\" in capital letters. The door is set within a thick, matching frame.",
    "Motion": "The heavy metal door remains stationary as the red light illuminating it pulsates, rhythmically brightening and dimming.",
    "Scene": "An indoor scene shows a heavy, weathered metal door illuminated by a strong red light. The door, which has a rounded rectangular shape, features a small circular porthole at the top and a six-spoked wheel handle in the center. It is flanked by dark, metallic walls with vertical, ribbed structures. A sign emitting a red glow with the text \"TOP SECRET\" is positioned on the lower section of the door. In the lower left corner of the screen, there is a very small white logo.",
    "Spatial": "A full shot captures a heavy metal door positioned in the center of the frame.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
