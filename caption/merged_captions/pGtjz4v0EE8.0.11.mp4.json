  "merged_caption": "The canal's water occupies the lower half of the frame, with several wooden posts visible in the middle ground. A yellow water taxi glides across a body of bright blue water, moving from the bottom left towards the left within this area, set against a stone waterfront where people stroll along. In the middle ground, occupying the top one-fourth of the frame above the water, a waterfront walkway and buildings are visible. The camera, from a high, aerial angle, slightly unsteady, maintains a deep focus and quickly zooms out from the river and the scenery across it, revealing multiple boats navigating back and forth across the river. As the camera zooms out, a diverse array of buildings densely lines the riverbank in the middle ground, with a few people visible walking along the waterfront during the daytime. In the background, another section of the river and more buildings are revealed. The video begins with a wide view of a Venetian canal, capturing the vibrant blue-green water and the overall atmosphere of the location. As the scene progresses, it transitions to an extreme wide shot, offering an even broader perspective of the cityscape. The composition highlights the sense of place, with a yellow water taxi adding a dynamic element within the expansive scenic context. The camera then slightly zooms back in to an extreme wide shot, making the elements appear smaller and revealing more of the surrounding buildings and another section of the canal in the background. Several clusters of weathered wooden posts stand in the water, creating a small wake as the yellow and white water taxi travels across the wide canal. This is a greatly accelerated time-lapse video shot from a high-angle, observational perspective.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
