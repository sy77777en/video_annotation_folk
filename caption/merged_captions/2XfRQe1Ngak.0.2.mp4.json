  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot, a kayaker is positioned in the foreground, occupying the bottom center-right of the frame. A second kayaker is visible further ahead in the middle ground, initially on the right side, then moving to the center-right of the frame. Steep, dark canyon walls line the left and right sides of the frame, with the left side extending from the foreground into the background and the right side extending from the middle ground into the background. The camera is mounted behind the paddler, moving forward above the water, tracking them from behind. Due to the constant shaking and rolling motion, the camera angle shifts from a level to a high angle and has a varying Dutch angle. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp. The camera is locked onto the main subject, who remains fixed in their position within the frame while paddling forward through the turbulent water. As the kayaker moves, the canyon walls on both sides pass by the camera. The person in the red kayak paddles forward through turbulent whitewater within a narrow, rocky canyon, actively using their paddle to navigate the fast-moving current. The kayak bobs and moves downstream, following a second kayaker who is visible further ahead in the distance. The main subject, seen from the back, wears a bright red waterproof jacket, a black life vest with green side panels, and a dark gray helmet with a white and red \"Teva\" logo on the back, holding a black paddle. The steep, dark rock walls of the gorge rise on either side, creating a tight passage filled with churning, white water. The fast-moving water and the proximity of the canyon walls create a dynamic outdoor scene during the daytime.",

    "Camera": "Mounted behind the paddler, the extremely unsteady camera moves forward above the water, tracking them from behind. Due to the constant shaking and rolling motion, the camera angle shifts from a level to a high angle and has a varying Dutch angle. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "From a locked-on POV, the main subject is a person in a red kayak paddling through turbulent whitewater in a narrow canyon. This individual, seen from the back, wears a bright red waterproof jacket, a black life vest with green side panels, and a dark gray helmet with a white and red \"Teva\" logo on the back. They are holding a black paddle. In the distance, ahead of the main subject, is a second person also in a red kayak.",
    "Motion": "From a locked-on POV, a person in a red kayak paddles forward through turbulent whitewater within a narrow, rocky canyon. They actively use their paddle to navigate the fast-moving current. The kayak bobs and moves downstream, following a second kayaker who is visible further ahead in the distance.",
    "Scene": "From a locked-on POV shot fixed to a kayaker, the viewer is immersed in the action of navigating a turbulent river through a narrow canyon. The steep, dark rock walls of the gorge rise on either side, creating a tight passage filled with churning, white water. The kayaker in the foreground, wearing a red drysuit and a dark helmet with a \"Teva\" logo, paddles vigorously, while another kayaker in a red boat can be seen further down the rapids. The fast-moving water and the proximity of the canyon walls create a dynamic outdoor scene during the daytime.",
    "Spatial": "In a medium shot, a kayaker is positioned in the foreground, occupying the bottom center-right of the frame. A second kayaker is visible further ahead in the middle ground, initially on the right side, then moving to the center-right of the frame. Steep, dark canyon walls line the left and right sides of the frame, with the left side extending from the foreground into the background and the right side extending from the middle ground into the background. The camera is locked onto the main subject, who remains fixed in their position within the frame while paddling forward through the turbulent water. As the kayaker moves, the canyon walls on both sides pass by the camera. The camera is positioned at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
