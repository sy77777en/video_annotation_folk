  "merged_caption": "The video opens on a tree stump in the left foreground, with a picket fence in the middle ground and out-of-focus trees in the background. A grey squirrel with a mix of grey and brown fur from the top of its head to its tail, except for its white underside, climbs up from the bottom of the frame, reaching the top of the tree stump with rough, textured bark. The camera is positioned at the squirrel's level, using a static, level-angle shot with a shallow depth of field, keeping the focus on the tree stump in the foreground. The squirrel lands on top of the stump, settling on its hind legs and holding a small, indistinct object in its front paws, which it proceeds to nibble on. The shot becomes a full shot of the squirrel, which remains positioned from the middle-left to the top-left quadrant of the frame in the foreground. The scene is set in an outdoor garden during the day, with a weathered, grey picket fence running across the scene in the middle ground. Beyond the fence, a dense area of bare, gnarled trees creates a natural backdrop.",

    "Motion": "A grey squirrel climbs up from out of view and reaches the top of a tree stump. It then sits on its hind legs and begins to nibble on an object held in its front paws.",
    "Scene": "In an outdoor garden setting during the day, a cut tree stump with rough, brown bark is positioned in the foreground. A weathered, grey picket fence runs across the scene in the middle ground. Beyond the fence, a dense area of bare, gnarled trees creates a natural backdrop. A grey squirrel with a bushy tail is situated on top of the stump.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
