  "merged_caption": "A medium shot frames a young man with light skin, wearing a blue short-sleeved t-shirt, black shorts, and a gray baseball cap, in the left foreground, with a paved path in the middle ground and a forest in the background. The scene takes place outdoors in a jungle setting under bright sunlight, suggesting it is around dusk. The man throws a vibrant red bell pepper into the air with his left hand, positioning it in the center foreground. He then swings a black and red tennis racket with white strings from the left toward the center of the frame in a forehand motion with his right hand. As the racket continues its swing across the frame to the right, it strikes the pepper, causing it to explode into a cloud of small red fragments and seeds that scatter primarily toward the right and bottom of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level and maintains a static, eye-level shot with a shallow depth of field, keeping the man in sharp focus. A speed ramp effect is used, transitioning from slow motion to an even slower motion, capturing the moment the racket strikes the pepper and the subsequent explosion of red fragments and pulp that disperses into the air. Clearly defined tree shadows on the ground indicate the area is well-lit by ample sunlight.",

    "Camera": "This static, eye-level shot uses a speed ramp effect, transitioning from slow motion to an even slower motion. The camera maintains a shallow depth of field, keeping the man in the foreground in sharp focus.",
    "Subject": "A young man with light skin, wearing a blue short-sleeved t-shirt, black shorts, and a gray baseball cap, swings a black and red tennis racket with white strings. The video captures the moment the racket strikes a whole, bright red bell pepper, causing it to explode into a cloud of small red pieces and seeds.",
    "Motion": "A person throws a red bell pepper into the air with their left hand before swinging a tennis racket forward in a forehand motion with their right hand, striking the pepper. Upon impact, the pepper explodes, sending a cloud of small red fragments and seeds flying forward and outward. The person completes the swing as the pieces of the pepper scatter through the air.",
    "Scene": "The scene takes place outdoors on a concrete path in a jungle setting, under bright sunlight, suggesting it is around dusk. A person in a blue t-shirt and black shorts swings a tennis racket with a dark red frame and white strings. A vibrant red bell pepper is struck by the racket, shattering into a spray of small red fragments and pulp that disperses into the air. Clearly defined tree shadows on the ground indicate the area is well-lit by ample sunlight.",
    "Spatial": "A medium shot frames a man in the left foreground, with a paved path in the middle ground and a forest in the background. A red bell pepper is thrown by the man and is in the air in the center foreground. The man swings a tennis racket from the left toward the center of the frame.  As the racket continues its swing across the frame to the right, it hits the pepper, causing it to explode in the center foreground, sending a cloud of red fragments scattering primarily toward the right and bottom of the frame.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
