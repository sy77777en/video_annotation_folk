  "merged_caption": "This video captures a dynamic, low-angle shot where the camera arcs around the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel in Paris at night. In this extreme wide shot, the monument, constructed from pink and white stone and featuring multiple arches, detailed carvings, and a bronze quadriga sculpture on top, is the central element, occupying the middle ground. The foreground at the bottom of the frame is a plaza where the blurred motion of people creates streaks, particularly on the left, while a more distinct group stands near the base of the arch on the right. The camera smoothly moves in a clockwise direction, effectively capturing the monument from various perspectives. In the middle ground, a portion of an illuminated building, the Louvre Palace, is visible on the left, and bare trees frame the monument on both sides. The background consists of a dark sky with drifting clouds at the top of the frame and distant city lights, including a Ferris wheel visible through one of the archways. A prominent streetlight on the far left creates a starburst effect, enhancing the dynamic visual experience. The long exposure technique blurs the movement of people walking around the landmark, contributing to the bustling yet timeless atmosphere of a Parisian night. The camera employs a deep focus to keep the entire monument and its surroundings in sharp detail. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays the text \"MATHIEU STANIĆ CINEMATOGRAPHER\".",

    "Camera": "This time-lapse video is captured from a low, eye-level perspective. The camera smoothly arcs clockwise around the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel, employing a deep focus to keep the entire monument and its surroundings in sharp detail.",
    "Subject": "This video captures a dynamic cityscape scenery shot of the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel in Paris at night. The monument, with its intricate carvings and a bronze quadriga sculpture on top, is brightly illuminated against the dark sky, where clouds drift by. The surrounding plaza is dotted with streetlights that create a starburst effect, and the blurred motion of people walking around the base of the arch indicates a time-lapse or long-exposure technique. There is no main subject, as the shot's purpose is to convey the grand atmosphere and architectural scale of the iconic landmark. The focus is on the environment and the feeling of a bustling yet timeless Parisian night, rather than on any individual person or object.",
    "Motion": "This nighttime time-lapse video of the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel in Paris showcases the grand arch brightly illuminated against the dark sky, with the Louvre Museum visible in the background.

    "Scene": "A nighttime time-lapse captures the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel in Paris. The monument, constructed from pink and white stone, is brightly illuminated against a dark sky where clouds are seen drifting. It features multiple arches, detailed carvings, and is crowned by a bronze quadriga sculpture. To the left, a portion of the illuminated Louvre Palace is visible, while bare trees and distant city lights, including a Ferris wheel, are seen in the background. People are gathered around the base of the arch, their movements creating blurred trails across the sandy plaza. A prominent streetlight on the left creates a starburst effect. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays the text \"MATHIEU STANIĆ CINEMATOGRAPHER\".",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
