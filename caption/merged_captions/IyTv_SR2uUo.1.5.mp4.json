  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot from a locked-on perspective inside a red, wire-frame shopping cart, the cart's frame occupies the foreground, framing the bottom and sides of the scene. A young boy with light brown skin, short dark brown hair, and dark eyes is positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, pushing the cart. He is wearing a light green short-sleeved t-shirt and dark shorts with a white pattern. He holds onto the top front bar of the cart with both hands and looks up and to his right. Inside the cart, a large purple bag of chips with a yellow cartoon character on the front rests at the bottom right. On the left and right, tall grocery shelves are in the middle ground and extend into the background, fully stocked with various packaged goods in bags and jars. The camera, positioned at the boy's eye level, smoothly pans to the right, tracking the movement through the brightly lit aisle of a grocery store. As the cart is pushed, the camera maintains a deep focus, keeping both the boy and the surrounding environment in sharp detail. The white ceilings with rectangular fluorescent lights illuminate the scene, and the shelves of products pass by as the cart moves forward.",

    "Subject": "A young boy with light brown skin, short dark brown hair, and dark eyes is pushing a red metal shopping cart.

    "Scene": "From a locked-on POV shot mounted inside a red, wire-frame shopping cart, the camera moves forward through a brightly lit aisle of a grocery store. White ceilings with rectangular fluorescent lights illuminate the scene. On either side, tall shelves are fully stocked with various packaged goods in bags and jars. A young boy, leaning forward and holding onto the front of the red cart, looks up to his right while the shelves of products pass by. Inside the cart with the camera, a large purple bag of chips rests against the side.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
