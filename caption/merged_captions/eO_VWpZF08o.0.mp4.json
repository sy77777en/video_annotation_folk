  "merged_caption": "This wide shot initially frames a shirtless, athletic man with dark skin, short dark hair, and a full beard in the bottom right foreground, while a second man with dark skin, wearing a long-sleeved black shirt and blue shorts, is positioned in the bottom left middle ground holding a basketball. In the foreground, a basketball hoop is located at the top center, set against a large wall mural featuring a prominent pair of hands, a depiction of an athlete, and the word \"SUCCESS\" in green letters on a yellow stripe. The court floor is marked with large yellow letters, including the word \"COSTA\" on the green surface. As the action begins, the man in blue shorts passes the basketball to the shirtless man, who then moves from the bottom right towards the center of the frame, jumping towards the hoop. The camera predominantly follows the basketball, starting from a high-angle shot that quickly tilts down to an eye-level perspective, maintaining deep focus for a sharp scene. The slightly unsteady camera tracks the ball, trucking to the right while panning right and then left, with a subtle upward pedestal to follow the action. Concurrently, a third man with dark skin, dressed in a white t-shirt and blue shorts, runs from right to left across the middle ground, passing behind the main subject. The shirtless man catches the basketball and jumps toward the hoop, dunking the ball with his left hand. The video ends just as the dunk is made. Positioned behind the first two men, the third man continues running from the right side of the court to the left. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level, capturing the dynamic movement and energy of the scene.",

    "Scene": "The scene takes place on an indoor basketball court with a green and yellow painted floor. A large, colorful mural covers the wall behind a basketball hoop, which has a black-framed backboard and a white net. The mural features a prominent pair of hands, a depiction of an athlete, and the word \"SUCCESS\" in green letters on a yellow stripe. The court floor is marked with large yellow letters, including the word \"COSTA\" on the green surface. To the right, a section of the wall displays the US flag and a sign with red lettering next to it. Several people are on the court during the activity.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
