  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a man in a laboratory, initially positioned in the center foreground. He is dressed in a white lab coat, black pants, and black shoes, and is facing away from the camera, engaging with laboratory equipment. The laboratory has tiled walls and a tiled floor, creating a clean and sterile environment. As the camera, positioned at eye level with a level angle, employs deep focus for a large depth of field, it begins with a slight pan to the left, transitioning the focus from the man to encompass the entire room. The shot transitions to a wide view, and the man shifts to the center-right of the middle ground, maintaining his focus on the task at hand. In the left foreground, there is a white table with a small brown cabinet on top. Behind the man, in the background, a row of metal cabinets lines one side of the room, providing storage space. The tiled walls and floor extend across the entire scene. A round clock, initially located in the upper left corner of the background, changes to a center-right position due to the camera movement. Two large windows are located on the right side of the frame, offering a view into another indoor space. The laboratory is equipped with various scientific instruments and equipment on the countertops, including microscopes and glassware. Posters with human anatomy diagrams adorn the walls, indicating that this could be a medical laboratory and contributing to the educational and research-focused ambiance. The camera then smoothly moves backward, maintaining steadiness throughout, revealing more of the laboratory environment, including additional equipment and furniture. The overall color scheme is neutral, with shades of gray and white dominating the scene.",

    "Camera": "The video features a camera at eye level with a level angle, employing deep focus for a large depth of field. It begins with a slight pan to the left, transitioning the focus from a man in a lab coat working at a counter to encompass the entire room. The camera then smoothly moves backward, maintaining steadiness throughout.",
    "Subject": "The video features a man in a laboratory setting. He is wearing a white lab coat, black pants, and black shoes, and has short hair. The man is standing at a counter, facing away, and appears to be engaged in a task involving laboratory equipment. The room contains various scientific instruments and furniture, including a row of metal cabinets and a desk. The overall setting suggests a scientific or medical environment.",
    "Motion": "The video shows a man in a white lab coat standing at a counter in a laboratory, with his back to the camera. The laboratory has tiled walls, a clock on the wall, and various scientific equipment on the counter and shelves. The man remains in the same position throughout the frames, indicating he is focused on his task. The camera gradually moves away from the man, revealing more of the laboratory environment, including additional equipment and furniture.",
    "Scene": "The video depicts an indoor laboratory setting with a clinical and organized atmosphere. The room features tiled walls and a tiled floor, creating a clean and sterile environment. There are lights on the ceiling. Metal cabinets line one side of the room, providing storage space. White tables and chairs are present, with brown storage cabinets on the tables, and a brown table is situated on the left side. A round clock is mounted on the wall. Two large windows reveal a view of another indoor space outside the room. The laboratory is equipped with various scientific instruments and equipment on the countertops, including microscopes and glassware. A person in a white lab coat is engaged in work at one of the counters, adding a sense of activity. Posters with human anatomy diagrams adorn the walls, indicating that this could be a medical laboratory and contributing to the educational and research-focused ambiance. The overall color scheme is neutral, with shades of gray and white dominating the scene.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium shot of a man in a laboratory, initially positioned in the center foreground. He is dressed in a white lab coat and is facing away from the camera, engaging with laboratory equipment. As the camera moves, the shot transitions to a wide view, and the man shifts to the center-right of the middle ground, maintaining his focus on the task at hand. In the left foreground, there is a white table with a small brown cabinet on top. Behind the man, in the background, a row of metal cabinets against the wall, on the left side of the frame. The tiled walls and floor extend across the entire scene. A round clock, initially located in the upper left corner of the background, changes to a center-right position due to the camera movement. Two large windows are located on the right side of the frame, offering a view into another indoor space. The camera maintains a level height relative to the subject, capturing the laboratory environment comprehensively as the shot expands."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
