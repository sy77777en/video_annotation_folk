  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a soldier positioned in the center-right foreground, wearing full tactical gear, including a black helmet, a full-face gas mask with a visible corrugated hose, a tan tactical vest over a tan long-sleeved shirt, a blue band on his left bicep, and tan pants, while carrying a black rifle. Other soldiers, similarly attired in helmets, gas masks, and military fatigues, are to his left and behind him in the middle ground. As the group runs from right to left across the frame through a sunlit, arid desert landscape characterized by dusty, brown terrain and distant rocky mountains under a clear sky, the camera follows their movement, transitioning into a medium full shot that reveals more of their bodies. The unsteady, eye-level camera first performs a lead-tracking shot, moving backward to follow the group as they run toward it. The camera then pans and trucks to the left, side-tracking the soldiers and revealing more of the battlefield. During this action, a large, fiery explosion with a distinctive effect occurs in a ruined building located in the middle ground on the left side of the frame. The explosion begins as a black and orange mushroom cloud and then appears to play in reverse, shrinking back down to nothing. Throughout the shot, distant mountains are visible in the background, and the camera remains at the subjects' level. As the soldier in the foreground runs forward through the desolate, rubble-strewn landscape, he briefly turns his head to the right. He continues running forward as part of a group of soldiers who are all moving together as a unit.",

    "Camera": "With a shallow depth of field focused on the soldiers in the foreground, the unsteady, eye-level camera first performs a lead-tracking shot, moving backward to follow the group as they run toward it. The camera then pans and trucks to the left, side-tracking the soldiers and revealing more of the battlefield.",
    "Subject": "The main subject is a soldier in the foreground, running while wearing full tactical gear. He has on a black helmet and a full-face gas mask with a visible corrugated hose connected to the side. He is dressed in a tan tactical vest over a tan long-sleeved shirt, with a blue band on his left bicep, and tan pants. He carries a black rifle. Following him and running alongside are several other soldiers, who constitute the secondary subjects. They are all similarly attired in helmets, gas masks, and military fatigues, and are also carrying rifles, moving together as a unit.",
    "Motion": "A soldier in the foreground runs forward through a desolate, rubble-strewn landscape while holding a rifle. As he runs, he briefly turns his head to the right. In the middleground, an explosion creates a unique visual effect, appearing to unfold in reverse. It starts as a large black and orange mushroom cloud and then contracts back to nothing. He continues running forward as part of a group of soldiers who are all moving together as a unit.",
    "Scene": "The scene unfolds in a sunlit, arid desert landscape characterized by dusty, brown terrain and distant rocky mountains under a clear sky. The area is scattered with the rubble and ruins of multi-story concrete buildings. A group of soldiers in full tactical gear, including helmets and gas masks, run through this environment as a large, fiery explosion with a distinctive effect erupts in the middleground. The explosion begins as a black and orange mushroom cloud and then appears to play in reverse, shrinking back down to nothing.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium shot of a soldier positioned in the center-right foreground, with other soldiers to his left and behind him in the middle ground. As the group runs from right to left across the frame, the camera follows their movement, transitioning into a medium full shot that reveals more of their bodies. During this action, a large explosion occurs in a ruined building located in the middle ground on the left side of the frame. Throughout the shot, distant mountains are visible in the background, and the camera remains at the subjects' level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
