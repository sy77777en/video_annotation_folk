  "merged_caption": "In a worm's eye view, the curved stone base of a monument occupies the bottom-center foreground. A bronze horse head statue, detailed with a bridle, rises from this base, positioned in the center middle ground. The scene is symmetrically framed on the left, right, and bottom by the illuminated upper stories of tall, yellow-hued buildings, which are situated in the middle ground and form a U-shape. This architectural framing opens up to the dark night sky, which is visible in the top-center background. The camera executes a slow and smooth zoom-in, positioned below the central statue, looking directly upward. The video features a slow and smooth zoom-in effect on the horse statue and the surrounding buildings, with the subtle drift of faint clouds across the dark night sky. The statue is framed on three sides by the illuminated facades of multi-story, light-colored stone buildings. These buildings, lit from below by warm, yellow light, feature numerous windows and small balconies with iron railings. The shot utilizes a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays the text \"MATHIEU STANIĆ\" with \"CINEMATOGRAPHER\" underneath.",

    "Camera": "This time-lapse video is captured from a worm's-eye angle, looking directly up at a statue. The shot utilizes a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera performs a slow and smooth zoom-in on the statue.",
    "Subject": "A dark, metallic statue of a horse's head and neck is seen from a worm's eye view perspective, looking up towards the night sky. The horse, which appears to be made of bronze, is detailed with a bridle and emerges from a large, light-colored stone base. The base has a curved, undulating form. Framing the central monument are the illuminated upper stories of tall, yellow-hued buildings with numerous windows and balconies, creating a U-shape against the dark sky.",
    "Motion": "The video features a slow and smooth zoom-in effect on a horse statue and the surrounding buildings, with the subtle drift of clouds across the dark night sky.",
    "Scene": "From a worm's-eye view looking directly up at a dark night sky, a bronze statue of a horse's head and neck sits atop a large, curved stone pedestal. The statue is framed on three sides by the illuminated facades of multi-story, light-colored stone buildings. These buildings, lit from below by warm, yellow light, feature numerous windows and small balconies with iron railings. Faint clouds are visible moving across the dark sky above the U-shaped opening formed by the rooftops. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays the text \"MATHIEU STANIĆ\" with \"CINEMATOGRAPHER\" underneath.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
