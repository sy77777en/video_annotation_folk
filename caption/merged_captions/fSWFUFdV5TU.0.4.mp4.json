  "merged_caption": "This medium shot frames an older woman with long, light-colored hair, positioned in the left-center of the middle ground, reclining on a couch in a dimly lit room. She wears a light-colored, short-sleeved top and has a somber expression as she looks off-camera to her left. A light beam enters from the top right, illuminating the side of her face and the front of her body, while the rest of the scene is cast in deep shadow. Her left arm rests on the armrest of the couch, and her right arm is positioned next to her body. The couch is draped with a patterned, lace-like cover, and in the background, a shelf holds a few indistinct objects. A thin wisp of smoke drifts slowly upwards on the right side of the scene, adding a subtle element of motion to the otherwise still environment. A second person briefly enters the right foreground, partially obscuring the woman, before moving out of the frame to the left. From a smooth, hip-level perspective, the camera slowly moves forward, maintaining a shallow depth of field that keeps the woman sitting on the couch in focus. The color palette is muted and cool, contrasting with the warm glow of the light.",

    "Camera": "From a smooth, hip-level perspective, the camera slowly moves forward. It maintains a shallow depth of field, keeping the woman sitting on the couch in the midground in focus.",
    "Subject": "An older woman with long, light-colored hair is shown in a dimly lit room, reclining on a couch. She wears a light-colored, short-sleeved top and has a somber expression as she looks off-camera to her left. A subtle light source from the right gently illuminates the side of her face and the front of her body, while the rest of the scene is cast in deep shadow. Her left arm rests on the armrest of the couch, and her right arm is positioned next to her body. A thin wisp of smoke is visible drifting through the beam of light. Another individual briefly enters the frame from the right and exits to the left.",
    "Motion": "An older woman sits motionless on a couch as a thin wisp of smoke drifts upward in a beam of light. A second person walks from right to left, briefly passing through the foreground and obscuring the view of the woman.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set within a dimly lit room, largely cast in shadow. A single, subtle light source from the right highlights an older woman seated on a couch positioned in the middle ground. The couch is draped with a patterned, lace-like cover, and in the background, a shelf holds a few indistinct objects. The color palette is muted and cool, contrasting with the warm glow of the light. A thin wisp of smoke drifts slowly upwards on the right side of the scene, adding a subtle element of motion to the otherwise still environment.",
    "Spatial": "This medium shot frames an older woman positioned in the left-center of the middle ground, reclining on a couch. A light beam enters from the top right, illuminating the side of the woman's face and the front of her body, as well as a shelf in the right background. A second person briefly enters the right foreground, partially obscuring the woman, before moving out of the frame to the left. The camera moves forward and remains at the subject's level throughout the scene."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
