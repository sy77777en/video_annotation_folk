  "merged_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a London cityscape, focusing on the scenery. The Elizabeth Tower, commonly known as Big Ben, is positioned in the center of the frame in the middle ground, with the Palace of Westminster extending across the left side of the frame, also in the middle ground. The ornate, light-colored stone buildings in the Gothic Revival style occupy the left and center of the view, with some scaffolding visible at the base of the clock tower. A lamppost initially occupies the center of the frame in the middle ground and shifts to the left side of the foreground as the camera advances, eventually exiting the frame. To the right, another large building is situated in the middle ground, with two red double-decker buses in motion at the bottom right, suggesting the constant motion of city traffic. The sky, filled with fast-moving, teal-tinted clouds, fills the top of the frame in the background. The camera, positioned at a low, eye-level angle looking up at the architecture, moves forward and tilts upward smoothly and quickly, likely from a vehicle on a bridge. A deep focus keeps the entire scene, from the foreground scenery to the rapidly moving clouds in the background, sharp and clear. The overall scene has a sense of movement, as if viewed from a moving vehicle, capturing the grand scale and atmospheric quality of the environment. The video lacks a main subject because its focus is on capturing the dramatic cityscape scenery shot of London, using the famous landmarks to establish a powerful sense of place.",

    "Camera": "This is a time-lapse video of Big Ben in London, shot from a low, eye-level perspective. The camera moves forward and tilts up smoothly and quickly. A deep focus keeps the entire scene, from the foreground scenery to the rapidly moving clouds in the background, sharp and clear.",
    "Subject": "This is a dramatic cityscape scenery shot of London, centered on the iconic Elizabeth Tower, commonly known as Big Ben. The tall clock tower stands prominently against a moody, teal-colored sky filled with streaked, fast-moving clouds. To the left, the ornate Gothic architecture of the Palace of Westminster extends into the frame, while on the right, blurred red double-decker buses suggest the constant motion of city traffic. The video lacks a main subject because its focus is on capturing the grand scale and atmospheric quality of the environment, using the famous landmarks to establish a powerful sense of place.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenery shot of the Elizabeth Tower (Big Ben) and the Houses of Parliament in London. The camera is in motion, moving past the iconic landmarks, likely from a vehicle on a bridge. The clouds also appear to be moving quickly in a time-lapse effect across the dramatic, teal-colored sky.",
    "Scene": "This outdoor scene in London features the Elizabeth Tower, also known as Big Ben, and the Palace of Westminster under a dramatic, overcast sky with fast-moving, teal-tinted clouds. The ornate, light-colored stone buildings in the Gothic Revival style occupy the left and center of the view, with some scaffolding visible at the base of the clock tower. To the right is another large building, and on the street below, two red double-decker buses are visible in motion. A lamppost, initially in the middle ground, moves towards the camera, transitioning into the foreground before disappearing out of the frame on the left side. The overall scene has a sense of movement, as if viewed from a moving vehicle.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
