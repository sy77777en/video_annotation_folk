  "merged_caption": "In a close-up shot inside a moving vehicle during the daytime, a man in a clown mask is positioned in the foreground, occupying the left and center of the frame. The camera, fixed to the side of the car at an eye-level angle, smoothly tracks to the right, utilizing a shallow depth of field that focuses on the upper body of the person in the front passenger seat. This man, wearing a white mask with a high white nose, blue accents, blue makeup around the eyes, and red lips painted in a wide, slightly downturned smile, occasionally glances at the driver before turning his head forward and looking down. Dark hair is visible at the back of his head, and he wears a dark collared garment. In the middle ground on the center-right, another man in a clown mask is driving the car. His mask also features blue eye makeup and a wide red smile, with a tuft of spiky, light-colored hair atop it. He is dressed in a dark blue suit jacket over a dark-colored collared shirt and occasionally turns his head to watch both sides as he steers the vehicle. A third masked man is partially visible in the middle ground on the far left, wearing a clown mask with less distinct features due to distance and focus, and a similar suit. The interior of the vehicle is dimly lit, with the primary light source coming from the windows, which show a blurred, out-of-focus view of an urban or suburban environment passing by. The steering wheel is visible in the middleground, contributing to the overall dark and confined atmosphere within the vehicle. The camera maintains a stable frame on the car's occupants as the scenery passes by outside the windows, capturing the slight movements of the third man in the back seat as he moves with the car.",

    "Camera": "From an eye-level, level angle inside a moving vehicle, the camera is fixed to the side of the car, smoothly tracking to the right. The shot utilizes a shallow depth of field, focusing on the upper body of the person in the front passenger seat, while the driver and the background remain out of focus.",
    "Subject": "Inside a car, three men are visible, each wearing a distinct clown mask. The man in the front passenger seat is in profile, facing right. His white mask features a high white nose with blue accents, blue makeup around the eyes, and red lips painted in a wide, slightly downturned smile. Dark hair is visible at the back of his head, and he wears a dark collared garment. The man in the driver's seat, also wearing a white clown mask with blue eye makeup and a wide red smile, has a tuft of spiky, light-colored hair atop his mask. He is dressed in a dark blue suit jacket over a dark-colored collared shirt and occasionally turns his head to watch both sides. In the back seat, another man is partially visible, wearing a clown mask with less distinct features due to distance and focus, and a similar suit.",
    "Motion": "Three men in clown masks ride in a moving car. The driver steers the vehicle, turning his head from side to side. The front passenger occasionally glances at the driver before turning his head forward and looking down, while a third man in the back seat moves slightly with the car.",
    "Scene": "The scene takes place inside a moving vehicle, likely a car or van, during the daytime. The interior is dimly lit, with the primary light source coming from the windows, which show a blurred, out-of-focus view of an urban or suburban environment passing by. The steering wheel is visible in the middleground. The overall atmosphere is somewhat dark and confined within the vehicle.",
    "Spatial": "In a close-up shot, a man in a clown mask is positioned in the foreground, occupying the left and center of the frame. In the middle ground on the center-right, another man in a clown mask is driving the car. A third masked man is partially visible in the middle ground on the far left. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level from within the vehicle, maintaining a stable frame on the car's occupants as the scenery passes by outside the windows."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
