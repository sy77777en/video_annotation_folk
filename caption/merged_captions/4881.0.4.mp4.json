  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a high-angle, hip-level shot featuring a close-up of a pair of hands centrally located in the frame and positioned in the middle ground. These hands, belonging to a person with fair skin, are shown painting their fingernails with white polish on a small pink tray. In the foreground, a pink box occupies the bottom left, while a gold-trimmed glass container sits at the bottom center. The tray also holds a small, ornate silver tool and rests on a glass surface. The camera, with a shallow depth of field, focuses on the hands as one applies dark polish to a nail on the other. The camera then smoothly tilts up and zooms out, executing a rack focus to shift the plane of focus from the hands in the middle ground to the person's face in the foreground. This reframes the scene into a medium close-up shot, revealing a man with curly brown hair and a prominent mustache, wearing a light blue, fuzzy cardigan over a white tank top and a gold chain necklace. He is now the central subject, positioned in the center of the frame and in the foreground. The camera is positioned at the subject's level for the duration of the clip. The man looks directly at the camera with a neutral expression, completing the transition from the initial focus on the hands to a full view of the individual in an indoor setting with soft lighting.",

    "Subject": "The video features a person with fair skin, whose hands are shown painting their fingernails with white polish.

    "Motion": "A person's hands are shown as they carefully apply white polish to their fingernails. The camera then tilts upward, revealing a man who looks directly at the camera with a steady gaze.",
    "Scene": "In an indoor setting with soft lighting, a person's hands with white-painted fingernails are shown on a small pink tray as one hand applies dark polish to a nail on the other. The tray, which also holds a small, ornate silver tool, rests on a glass surface next to a pink box and a gold-trimmed glass container. The camera then tilts upward, revealing a man with a mustache wearing a fuzzy, light-blue cardigan, a white top, and a gold chain necklace, providing a complete view of the individual.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
