  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot, featuring a canal in the center of the frame, stretching from the foreground to the background. Buildings are positioned on the left and right sides of the frame, extending from the foreground to the background, with the sky occupying the top background. The camera starts above a river at a level angle, which is maintained throughout, and uses deep focus, keeping everything sharp. Initially, the camera moves forward along the canal, with a Dutch angle present and varying due to camera rolling. As the camera progresses, the buildings on the left and right sides of the canal become more detailed, showing a mix of orange, yellow, and beige facades. A small, green-covered boat is moored along one side of the canal. The camera continues to move forward, revealing more of the canal and the buildings, including greenery on both sides. The drone flies forward above the river, initially panning left while ascending to an aerial level. As the camera ascends, the rooftops of the buildings come into view, showing terracotta tiles and various architectural details. The camera continues to rise, transitioning to an extreme wide shot, providing a broader view of the canal and the densely packed buildings, with more rooftops and distant structures becoming visible. In this subsequent framing, the initial canal is visible slightly to the right at the bottom, extending from the middle ground to the background, while a broad cityscape of rooftops and buildings populates the middle ground and background across the left, center, and right, with the sky remaining in the top background. Once high above the ground and above the buildings, it slightly pans right, showcasing fluid maneuvers. The sunlight casts long shadows, indicating either morning or late afternoon.",

The camera uses deep focus, keeping everything sharp. The drone flies forward above the river, initially panning left while ascending to an aerial level. Once high above the ground and above the buildings, it slightly pans right, showcasing fluid maneuvers. The camera movement is very smooth.",
    "Subject": "The video presents a dynamic cityscape scenery shot, initially flying low along a sunlit canal in Venice, flanked by colorful, historic buildings with terracotta roofs. The camera then ascends, revealing a broader panorama of the densely packed city, showcasing more canals, diverse architecture, and the expanse of rooftops under a clear blue sky. There is no single main subject because the focus is on capturing the overall environment, atmosphere, and architectural scale of Venice, emphasizing the unique urban landscape formed by its waterways and historic structures rather than singling out a specific element.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a view of a narrow canal flanked by buildings on both sides, with the camera moving forward along the canal. As the camera progresses, the buildings on the left and right sides of the canal become more detailed, showing a mix of orange, yellow, and beige facades. The camera continues to move forward, revealing more of the canal and the buildings, including greenery on both sides.

    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone glides smoothly along a narrow canal in Venice, Italy, under a clear blue sky. The water in the canal is dark, reflecting the surrounding multi-story buildings. These buildings, with facades in shades of ochre, yellow, and red, feature terracotta tile roofs and numerous rectangular windows, some with shutters. As the drone continues forward, it ascends, revealing a broader cityscape of similar architecture, with more canals and buildings stretching into the distance, punctuated by a few distant bell towers. A small, green-covered boat is moored along one side of the canal. The sunlight casts long shadows, indicating either morning or late afternoon.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a wide shot, featuring a canal in the center of the frame, stretching from the foreground to the background.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
