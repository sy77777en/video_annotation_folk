  "merged_caption": "A medium close-up shot initially frames a young man with voluminous, shoulder-length, curly blonde hair and a young woman with long, straight, light brown hair from behind the man's left shoulder. The man, wearing a light-colored suit jacket, a black bow tie, and a white flower boutonnière on his lapel, is slow dancing with the woman, who wears a pink and white floral corsage on her left wrist. The man's back is in the center-left of the frame, while the woman is positioned in the center-right, with her face partially visible. In the background, star-shaped foil decorations hang from the top of the frame, and the space is adorned with strings of small, multi-colored lights, creating a festive backdrop. The scene takes place indoors at a dimly lit event, possibly a dance, under a dark ceiling, with atmospheric lighting in hues of red, purple, and yellow, creating a soft, moody ambiance. The camera, positioned at a low angle between hip and eye level, slightly unsteady, arcs counterclockwise around the dancing couple, revealing a frontal view of the man in the center as he looks toward the woman, whose back is now on the left. The couple sways gently back and forth in a close embrace, with the woman keeping her head near the man's shoulder as they dance and converse, maintaining their hold on each other with her arms on his shoulders. The perspective then returns to a position behind the man before shifting back to a frontal view of him in the center, with the woman on the left. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the couple in the foreground in focus, and remains at the subjects' level throughout these movements.",

    "Scene": "The scene takes place indoors at a dimly lit event, possibly a dance, under a dark ceiling. The background is adorned with shiny, star-shaped foil decorations and strings of small, multi-colored lights. The space is bathed in atmospheric lighting with prominent hues of red, purple, and yellow, creating a soft, moody ambiance. A young couple is slow dancing in the center of the frame, with the camera capturing their movements from close, shifting angles against the festive backdrop.",
    "Spatial": "A medium close-up shot initially frames a young man and woman from behind the man's left shoulder. The man's back is in the center-left of the frame, while the woman is positioned in the center-right, with her face partially visible. In the background, star-shaped decorations hang from the top of the frame. The camera then arcs around both the man and the woman, revealing a frontal view of the man in the center as he looks toward the woman, whose back is now on the left. The perspective then returns to a position behind the man before shifting back to a frontal view of him in the center, with the woman on the left.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
