  "merged_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of a scimitar-horned oryx, with its head nearly filling the entire frame. The oryx's head is positioned in the center-left foreground, with its body extending towards the right side of the frame. The animal, featuring its distinctive long, dark, ribbed horns that curve slightly backward, has a head predominantly white with distinct brown markings: a stripe running down the center of its face from between its horns to its nose, a marking on its forehead, and patches around its eyes. Its ears are pointed and upright. The front part of its body, including its neck and shoulders, is a reddish-brown color, which transitions to a very light, almost white hue with a subtle bluish tint on the rest of its visible torso. The oryx is facing slightly to its left, with its head turned to look directly at the camera. While looking at the camera, the oryx's left eye twitches twice, resembling a blink, and a fly can be seen flying away from its nose. The background consists of light-colored sand or dirt, appearing out of focus and overexposed, filling the rest of the frame. The camera is static, positioned at eye level and a level angle, employing a shallow depth of field to keep the oryx in the foreground in sharp focus. There are no changes in shot size or the position of elements throughout the video. The scene is set outdoors during the daytime, with the oryx standing against an overexposed, brightly lit background.",

    "Scene": "The video showcases a close-up view of a scimitar-horned oryx outdoors during the daytime. The animal, featuring its distinctive long, curved horns and a white and tan coat with a bluish tint, stands against an overexposed, brightly lit, out-of-focus background. The ground beneath appears to be light-colored sand or dirt.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
