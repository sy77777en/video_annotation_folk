  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a glossy black BMW sedan, focusing on its front passenger-side wheel on the left and its illuminated bright white LED headlight in the upper center part of the frame. The car is customized with black wheels that have a red center cap, a front lip spoiler, and a license plate that reads \"REIN.\" A white sticker text reading \"THE-LOWDOWN.COM\" is visible on the lower part of the windshield, accompanied by a red hollow square logo sticker to the left of the white text. The camera starts at ground level and rises to hip level, using a shallow depth of field to keep the focus on the car in the foreground. The camera then trucks right to track the side of the car, which is driving forward through a dimly lit tunnel with light-colored concrete walls and a light road surface. As the camera arcs counterclockwise, it moves ahead of the vehicle, revealing the entire front of the car, including its illuminated amber turn signal. In the final composition, the car is positioned in the middle ground of the frame, moving forward as it continues to drive through the tunnel, which forms both the middle ground and background. The background is blurred, indicating the car's forward motion.",

    "Camera": "This is a smooth, quick, level-angle shot of a black car driving through a tunnel. The camera begins at ground level and rises to hip level. Using a shallow depth of field, the focus remains on the car in the foreground. The camera trucks right to track the side of the car, then arcs counterclockwise to move ahead of it, ultimately revealing the entire vehicle from the front for a complete view.",
    "Subject": "A glossy black BMW sedan is featured with its bright white LED headlights and an orange turn signal illuminated. The car is customized with black wheels that have a red center cap, a front lip spoiler, and a license plate that reads \"REIN\". A white sticker text reading \"THE-LOWDOWN.COM\" is visible on the lower part of the windshield, accompanied by a red hollow square logo sticker to the left of the white text.",
    "Motion": "A black car drives forward in a tunnel. The camera starts with a close-up on the front passenger-side wheel and headlight, then trucks right to track the side of the car before arcing counterclockwise to move ahead of it, revealing the entire front of the vehicle as it continues to move straight ahead.",
    "Scene": "A glossy black car with its bright white headlights and an amber turn signal illuminated drives through a dimly lit tunnel. The tunnel has light-colored concrete walls and a light road surface. The car features black wheels with red center caps, a front license plate that reads \"REIN,\" and a sticker on the windshield with the text \"THE-LOWDOWN.COM.\" The background is blurred, indicating the car's forward motion.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a black car, focusing on its front wheel on the left and its illuminated headlight in the upper center part of the frame. The camera then trucks right and arcs, transitioning to a full shot that reveals the entire vehicle from the front. In the final composition, the car is positioned in the middle ground of the frame, moving forward as it drives through a tunnel, which forms both the middle ground and background. Initially, the camera trucks right to follow the side of the car, then arcs counterclockwise to move ahead of the vehicle."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
