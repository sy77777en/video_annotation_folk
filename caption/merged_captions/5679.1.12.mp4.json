  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a full shot of a man with a deep brown skin tone, wearing an orange jacket, matching hat, beige shorts, and red shoes, standing on a wooden bridge in a lush, dense forest. He is positioned in the center of the frame, both in the 2D and 3D space, with the forest forming the background. The bridge occupies the middle ground, while the dense greenery fills the background. The scene is set during the day, with natural light filtering through the canopy, creating a serene and vibrant atmosphere. The man begins by pointing forward with his right hand, then starts making various hand gestures while moving his body rhythmically. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to a wide shot, maintaining the man's central position but now showing more of the surrounding forest and the length of the bridge. The camera features a level angle with deep focus, capturing the man as it zooms out and tilts up, slightly unsteady with some shaking. The man continues to dance, moving his arms and body in a coordinated manner, occasionally pointing and making expressive hand movements. He maintains his dance routine, with his movements becoming more animated and expressive. The camera remains at the subject's height throughout, keeping the man's gestures and movements clearly visible against the natural backdrop. The man's dynamic hand movements and slight shifts in stance are consistently framed within the center of the shot, emphasizing his actions against the static environment. The bridge, weathered and covered with patches of moss, adds a rustic element to the environment, with its simple, functional railings blending with the natural surroundings. The ground is scattered with fallen leaves, hinting at a recent rain or the onset of autumn.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
