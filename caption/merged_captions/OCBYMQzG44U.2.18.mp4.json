  "merged_caption": "The video uses a wide shot to capture the entire room, with the camera positioned at water level, creating a split view of the water’s surface and the space above. The tiled walls and ceiling fill most of the frame, with the row of ceiling lights extending from the top center toward the background, emphasizing the room’s depth. On the left side of the frame in the background, a dark, arched opening is partially submerged, its top just above the waterline, while the rest of the opening recedes into darkness. In the background, slightly right of center, a set of white steps leads up to a raised platform and a tall, featureless doorway, both positioned in the middle ground to background. The water occupies the lower half of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground, with gentle ripples visible. The camera remains at a low, level angle throughout, matching the height of the water’s surface and maintaining a consistent perspective on the room’s spatial layout. This shot features mild barrel distortion, causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward. Positioned just above the water, the camera maintains a level angle and a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera moves smoothly toward the exit of the pool, intermittently panning left with brief pauses to adjust its direction. The scene is a large, rectangular room with walls covered in small, white grid tiles, illuminated by a row of bright, square ceiling lights. This clean, institutional setting is starkly contrasted by the dark, murky water that floods the lower half of the room. The overall scene is minimalistic, with clean lines and a monochromatic color palette dominated by white and muted tones. The camera's movement enhances the unsettling, liminal atmosphere of the space.",

    "Camera": "This shot features mild barrel distortion, causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward.

    "Subject": "This video presents a liminal space scenery shot, capturing an eerie and sterile environment. The focus is on the unsettling atmosphere of the location rather than a specific subject, creating a sense of mystery and unease. The scene is a large, rectangular room with walls covered in small, white grid tiles, illuminated by a row of bright, square ceiling lights. This clean, institutional setting is starkly contrasted by the dark, murky water that floods the lower half of the room, with the camera positioned at water level to give an immersive, level-angle perspective. On the left, the top of a dark, arched opening emerges from the gently rippling surface of the water in the back wall, with its interior shrouded in complete darkness. In the background, a set of white steps leads up to a raised platform and a tall, featureless doorway, adding to the enigmatic quality of the space.",
    "Motion": "The camera smoothly moves toward the pool's exit, occasionally panning left with brief pauses to adjust its direction, capturing a level-angle view from the surface of dark, murky water inside a large, tiled room. The walls are covered in small, pale green tiles, and the ceiling is illuminated by a row of bright, square lights. In the background, a large, dark, circular tunnel opening is partially submerged, and to the right, a set of white stairs leads up to a simple doorway, creating a sterile and unsettling, liminal atmosphere.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, shows an indoor environment resembling a large, empty pool room with white tiled walls and ceiling. The water level is high, with the viewer’s perspective partially submerged, creating a split view of the water’s surface and the space above. Overhead, a row of rectangular ceiling lights casts a bright, even illumination across the room, reflecting off the glossy tiles. At one end of the pool, a dark circular opening is visible on the wall, contrasting sharply with the otherwise pale surroundings. The water appears calm, with gentle ripples and a slightly reflective surface. The overall scene is minimalistic, with clean lines and a monochromatic color palette dominated by white and muted tones. No overlays, text, or additional visual elements are present.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
