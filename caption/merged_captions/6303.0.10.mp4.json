  "merged_caption": "In a high-angle wide shot, a woman sits on a black chair towards the center-left of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. She wears white headphones, a light green jacket over a pink shirt, light-colored pants, and reddish-brown shoes, and she is looking at a phone held in both of her hands. A white laundry basket rests on a small bench next to her. A man with dark, curly hair and a light brown complexion stands in the center, slightly to the right, also in the middle ground, holding a white laundry basket. He wears a bright red, textured, long-sleeved sweater, brown pants, and red shoes. The scene is set in a stylized laundromat with solid blue walls and a black and white checkerboard tile floor. Banks of light-colored, front-loading washing machines line the left and right walls, positioned further back in both the background and middle ground, with some of the machine drums emitting a green glow. A vending machine is located left of center in the background, while a large, framed landscape painting in a traditional style is mounted on the wall to the right, and another similar landscape is visible through a cutout on the left. The space is illuminated by square ceiling fixtures and horizontal fluorescent lights. The shot exhibits mild barrel distortion, causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward, and a deep focus is employed, keeping the entire scene sharp and clear. The man remains completely still until the tiles beneath him open, causing him to fall through the floor, while the woman slightly sways her upper body from side to side, likely in response to the music playing in her headphones.",

    "Camera": "This is a static, high-angle shot capturing two people in a laundromat. The shot exhibits mild barrel distortion, causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward. A deep focus is employed, keeping the entire scene sharp and clear.",
    "Subject": "In a laundromat, a man with dark, curly hair and a light brown complexion stands holding a white laundry basket. He wears a bright red, textured, long-sleeved sweater, brown pants, and red shoes, and he looks down toward a woman. The woman, who appears to be older, is seated on a black chair. She wears white headphones, a light green jacket over a pink shirt, light-colored pants, and reddish-brown shoes. She is looking at a phone held in both of her hands, and a white laundry basket rests on a small bench next to her.",
    "Motion": "The man remains completely still until the tiles beneath him open, causing him to fall through the floor, while the woman slightly sways her upper body from side to side, likely in response to the music playing in her headphones.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set in a stylized laundromat with a distinct visual design, captured from a high, wide-angle perspective that distorts the space. The room features solid blue walls and a black and white checkerboard tile floor. Banks of light-colored, front-loading washing machines line the walls, with some of the machine drums emitting a green glow. A vending machine stands against the back wall, and above a set of washers, a large, framed landscape painting in a traditional style is displayed. A similar landscape is visible through a cutout in the wall. The space is illuminated by square ceiling fixtures and horizontal fluorescent lights. An older woman is seated on a black chair on the left next to a laundry basket, while a man stands in the center holding another basket.",
    "Spatial": "In a high-angle wide shot, a woman sits on a chair towards the center-left of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. A man holding a laundry basket stands in the center, slightly to the right, also in the middle ground. The scene is captured with a wide-angle lens, distorting the perspective of the room. Banks of washing machines line the left and right walls, positioned further back in both the background and middle ground. Checkered tiles extend seamlessly from the foreground to the background. In the background, a vending machine is located left of center, while a large landscape image is mounted on the wall to the right, and another is visible through a cutout on the left."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
