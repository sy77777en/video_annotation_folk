  "merged_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of an urban environment, capturing a broad view of the cityscape. Initially, the camera focuses on the left side of the frame, showing a sidewalk lined with trees in the foreground and middle ground. A woman with pink hair and a black mask is standing still on the sidewalk. The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle while incorporating a varying Dutch angle due to rolling, with noticeable barrel distortion causing straight lines to curve outward. The video begins with a view of a street intersection, showing a 'One Way' sign, a 'No Turn on Red' sign, and a traffic light displaying a yellow hand signal. As the video progresses, the camera pans right with unsteady movement, exhibiting noticeable shaking, transitioning smoothly from the initial left side to the right side of the frame. This movement reveals a wide intersection in the center and right portions of the frame. A tree with pink blossoms and a street with parked cars come into view. Traffic lights and road signs occupy the top left and center areas, while vehicles are seen moving across the intersection in the middle ground. A red car drives on the road, and a black car travels past the intersection. Pedestrian crosswalks appear prominently in the lower center and right sections of the frame. The background features buildings of varying heights and trees, adding depth to the scene. The camera maintains a consistent height, positioned slightly above street level, providing a clear view of the entire intersection and surrounding area. The spatial composition shifts from a focus on the sidewalk to a broader perspective of the urban intersection, emphasizing the dynamic interplay between natural and built environments. The video ends with a view of the intersection, showing the silver car completing its turn and exiting the frame, while the black car continues moving straight.",

    "Camera": "The video features noticeable barrel distortion, causing straight lines to curve outward. The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle while incorporating a varying Dutch angle due to rolling. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera pans right with unsteady movement, exhibiting noticeable shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing an urban environment with elements like traffic lights, street signs, and crosswalks. The focus is on the overall environment rather than a specific object, highlighting the interaction of architecture, streets, and natural elements like trees. The presence of cars and pedestrians adds to the dynamic urban setting, while the sky and distant structures contribute to the sense of scale and space.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a view of a street intersection, showing a 'One Way' sign, a 'No Turn on Red' sign, and a traffic light displaying a yellow hand signal. A woman with pink hair and a black mask is standing still on the sidewalk. The camera then pans to the right, revealing more of the sidewalk, a tree with pink blossoms, and a street with parked cars. As the camera continues to move, it captures a red car driving on the road and a black car traveling past the intersection. As the camera pans, the video ends with a view of the intersection, showing the silver car completing its turn and exiting the frame, while the black car continues moving straight.",
    "Scene": "The video begins with the camera focused on a sidewalk, showcasing pedestrians and the vibrant mix of green and pink foliage from the trees lining the path. It then pans right to reveal an urban street scene during the day, featuring a wide intersection with visible traffic signals and road signs. The environment is outdoors, blending natural and urban elements. The sky is overcast, suggesting cloudy weather. Buildings of varying heights are visible in the background, contributing to the urban setting. Cars move through the intersection, and more pedestrians are present on the sidewalks, indicating a bustling city atmosphere. The crosswalks and road markings are clearly defined, enhancing the structured layout of the scene.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
