  "merged_caption": "The video features a silhouetted figure against a stark white background, centered in the frame as it moves horizontally from left to right. The figure, an animated silhouette of a person with a round head and no discernible facial features, is entirely black, creating a stark contrast against the white background. Initially, the person is holding a brown briefcase in their right hand and taking large strides with their arms swinging back and forth. Sparse green grass blades are visible, adding subtle texture to the minimalist outdoor setting. The camera smoothly moves right, following the animated silhouette as it walks across the scene. Midway through the video, the figure suddenly stops, raises the briefcase to chest level with both hands, and pulls it into its chest, causing the briefcase to disappear. The simplicity of the silhouette emphasizes the figure's dynamic movement and the briefcase as key visual elements. The camera tracks the figure's movement, maintaining a consistent perspective throughout the sequence. The overall scene is uncluttered, focusing on the contrast between the black silhouette and the white background, with the time of day indeterminate due to the lack of shadows or lighting cues.",

    "Scene": "The video depicts a minimalist outdoor setting with a stark white background and a simple horizontal line suggesting the ground. Sparse green grass blades are visible, adding subtle texture to the scene. The time of day is indeterminate due to the lack of shadows or lighting cues. A silhouetted figure, characterized by a smooth, featureless black shape, is present, holding a brown briefcase. The figure's movement is implied by its changing posture, suggesting a transition from walking to standing still. The overall scene is uncluttered, focusing on the contrast between the black silhouette and the white background.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
