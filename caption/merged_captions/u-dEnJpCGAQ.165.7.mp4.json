  "merged_caption": "The video presents a full shot of a group of elephants in a natural savanna setting, occupying most of the frame with their full bodies visible. Initially, an elephant is positioned on the left side of the frame in the middle ground, facing right, while the rest of the group is clustered towards the center and right, with their backs mostly turned to the camera. The elephants, with their thick, gray skin, large ears, and prominent tusks, are standing amidst tall, dry grass, suggesting a savanna environment. Sparse trees and distant hills form the backdrop, adding depth to the scene. The camera is positioned at the elephants' level, capturing their interactions and movements within the natural environment. The camera is at eye level and maintains a level angle, focusing on the elephants in the midground with a shallow depth of field. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement. As the video progresses, the elephant on the left moves slightly forward and to the right, altering its position within the frame. The group moves slowly and slightly, maintaining their positions in the middle ground. The elephants are moving slowly, with some of them lowering their heads and using their trunks to interact with the grass and vegetation. The elephants' ears are flapping, and their tusks are visible as they continue to move. The group maintains a close formation, with one elephant slightly separated from the group, facing right. The elephants' movements are gentle and deliberate, indicating a calm and natural behavior. The overall composition highlights the social nature and physical attributes of these majestic animals, with the serene outdoor setting and natural elements harmoniously integrated into the scene.",

    "Motion": "A group of elephants is seen in a natural, grassy environment with a hilly background. The elephants are moving slowly, with some of them lowering their heads and using their trunks to interact with the grass and vegetation. The elephants' ears are flapping, and their tusks are visible as they continue to move. The group maintains a close formation, with one elephant slightly separated from the group, facing right. The elephants' movements are gentle and deliberate, indicating a calm and natural behavior.",
    "Scene": "The video captures a serene outdoor setting in a savanna landscape during daylight. The scene features a group of elephants standing amidst tall, dry grass. The elephants, with their textured gray skin and large ears, are positioned in a natural formation, with nearly all turned away from the camera and only one facing to the right. Sparse trees and distant hills form the backdrop, adding depth to the environment. The overall atmosphere is calm, with the natural elements and wildlife harmoniously integrated into the scene.",
    "Spatial": "The video presents a full shot of a group of elephants in a natural savanna setting. The elephants occupy most of the frame, with their full bodies visible. Initially, an elephant is positioned on the left side of the frame in the middle ground, facing right, while the rest of the group is clustered towards the center and right, with their backs mostly turned to the camera.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
