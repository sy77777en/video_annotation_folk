  "merged_caption": "This wide shot is captured from a high, top-down angle, showing four static characters in a room. A male character with light brown hair, wearing a brown shirt and green pants, stands with his back to the camera, positioned centrally. In front of him, a female character with long, reddish-brown hair in a purple dress stands behind a long wooden table, which is covered in numerous small, white, paper-like rabbits. To the right, a ghost-like, semi-transparent man with dark hair and a woman with light blue hair stand together, both dressed in white lab coats. The room is dimly lit with dark teal carpeting and light brown wood-paneled walls, furnished with a central table, a bookshelf filled with red and green books at the top, a potted plant, a side table, and a floor lamp on the right. A brown stuffed platypus is on the table next to the woman in the purple dress. A semi-transparent dialogue box is overlaid in the center, initially displaying text from a character named John: \"What are ya making there?\" This text then changes to show dialogue from a character named River: \"Rabbits.\" The camera remains completely static throughout the video. At the bottom of the screen, a HUD features a blue bar and five colored circular icons.",

    "Subject": "In a pixel art scene, four characters are present in a room filled with small, white, paper-like rabbits. Near the center-left and bottom of the scene, a man with light brown hair, wearing a brown shirt and green pants, stands with his back to the viewer. In front of him, a woman with long, reddish-brown hair in a purple dress stands behind a long wooden table, which is covered in the paper rabbits. On the table next to her is a brown stuffed platypus. To the bottom right of the room, a ghost-like, semi-transparent man with dark hair and a woman with light blue hair stand together, both dressed in white lab coats. A dialogue box is present, showing a conversation between characters named \"John\" and \"River.\"",
    "Motion": "A text box appears, displaying dialogue from a character named John. A large quantity of white, rabbit-shaped objects can be seen on and around a central table. The first text box then vanishes and is replaced by a new one showing dialogue from a character named River.",
    "Scene": "A gaming video with an oblique top-down view shows an indoor scene in a dimly lit room with dark teal carpeting and light brown wood-paneled walls. The room is furnished with a large wooden table in the center, a bookshelf filled with red and green books against the back wall, a potted plant, and a side table. Numerous small, white, paper-like rabbits are scattered across the floor, and several pixel-art characters are present in the room. A semi-transparent dialogue box overlay appears in the center, displaying text that changes from \"John: What are ya making there?\" to \"River: Rabbits.\" At the bottom of the screen, a HUD features a blue bar and five colored circular icons. A floor lamp is also visible in the room.",
    "Spatial": "This wide shot is captured from a high, top-down angle, showing four static characters in a room. A male character stands with his back to the camera, positioned centrally. In front of him, a female character stands behind a long table. To the right, two other characters stand together. The room's furniture includes the central table, a bookshelf at the top, and a lamp on the right. Numerous small, white paper rabbits are scattered across the floor and table.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
