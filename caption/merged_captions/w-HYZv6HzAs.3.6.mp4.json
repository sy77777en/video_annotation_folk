  "merged_caption": "This is a full shot, with the camera positioned at the subject's level. A man stands in the center of the frame and in the middle ground on a wooden stage, wearing a light-colored dress shirt and dark trousers. He has a medium-dark skin tone and is bald. In the foreground, the silhouetted heads of an audience occupy the bottom of the frame. Behind the man, in the background, large red and white \"TEDx\" letters are positioned from the center to the right side of the frame, with blue-lit panels further behind them. The setting is a dimly lit auditorium, creating a contrast between the darkened seating area and the illuminated stage. The environment is formal and structured, with a focus on the speaker who is centrally positioned on the stage. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, focusing on the speaker on stage. It employs deep focus, maintaining clarity across the scene. The camera remains fixed but exhibits slight unsteadiness, with no intentional movement. The man, initially standing still with his hands clasped, begins speaking and makes a gesture with his left hand. He then starts to take a step to his left, using both his left and right arms to make a more pronounced gesture, emphasizing his speech with his body language. The lighting highlights the speaker and the backdrop, emphasizing the presentation setting. The stage floor is wooden, adding a warm tone to the scene. The audience is visible in silhouette, indicating their presence but not their details. The setting suggests a formal presentation or talk, with the man remaining in his central position on the stage while slightly shifting his upper body during his gestures.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
