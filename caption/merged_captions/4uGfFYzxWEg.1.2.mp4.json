  "merged_caption": "The scene is captured in a high-angle wide shot, framed by a dark, geometric structure in the foreground that partially obscures the view. The camera maintains an overhead position, moving forward and downward with a smooth motion until it approaches the perforated structure, then halts, offering a comprehensive view of the entire space from above. The shot uses a shallow depth of field, with the focus set on the background. In the background, a humanoid figure in a bright red, long-sleeved shirt sits slightly left of the frame's center on illuminated, tiered benches, serving as the central focus among a crowd of other figures. This main subject is otherwise gray and featureless, surrounded by numerous other identical, gray humanoid figures, all seated in similar poses on rows of benches. The entire scene is dark and shadowed, with the figures appearing like mannequins in a dimly lit, structured space. The red shirt provides the only point of vibrant color, making the main figure stand out distinctly from the monochrome crowd. The left side of the frame is brightly lit, highlighting the front edges of each tiered step and part of a roof beam. The scene is entirely static, with the central figure in the red shirt and the surrounding gray figures all remaining seated and motionless, while only the camera movement creates changes in the scene. From a high-angle viewpoint through an opening in a perforated ceiling, the scene captures a dark, cavernous interior with tiered seating. A single, warm orange light illuminates a section of the space, creating a stark contrast with the surrounding gloom. Seated in rows are numerous gray human figures dressed in gray clothing, most of whom are enveloped in darkness.",

    "Scene": "From a high-angle viewpoint through an opening in a perforated ceiling, the scene captures a dark, cavernous interior with tiered seating. A single, warm orange light illuminates a section of the space, creating a stark contrast with the surrounding gloom. Seated in rows are numerous gray human figures dressed in gray clothing, most of whom are enveloped in darkness. In the center of the lit section, one figure stands out, clad in a bright red garment, providing a single point of vibrant color in the otherwise muted and shadowy environment.",

The camera maintains an overhead position, moving forward until it approaches the perforated structure, then halts, offering a comprehensive view of the entire space from above. In the background, a figure in a red shirt sits slightly left of the frame's center on illuminated, tiered benches. This figure is surrounded by numerous gray human forms seated on the same long benches, extending from the middle-left of the frame to the right and continuing into the background, where they are mostly enveloped in shadow. The left side of the frame is brightly lit, highlighting the front edges of each tiered step and part of a roof beam."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
