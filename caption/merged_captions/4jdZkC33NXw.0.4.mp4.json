  "merged_caption": "This video captures a first-person point-of-view of someone walking down a quiet, wet residential street in a Japanese suburb on a rainy day. The wet asphalt road creates a strong leading line from the foreground into the background, reflecting the overcast sky. The slightly unsteady camera moves forward at eye level down the center of the street, maintaining a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp, from the parked cars in the foreground to the modern houses in the distance. On the left, a silver car is partially visible in the bottom-left foreground, while a red Mini Cooper and another red vehicle are parked in the left middle ground next to contemporary houses with clean lines and dark or neutral-colored facades. On the right, a black Toyota Prius is parked in the right middle ground, with a black minivan under a simple white carport just behind it. Utility poles and power lines run along the right side of the street, stretching from the middle ground into the background, and small green trees and bushes are planted alongside the properties. The forward-moving camera captures the serene and slightly melancholic atmosphere created by the steady rain and the quiet, orderly environment of the neighborhood. The overall atmosphere is calm and peaceful under the overcast sky, with rain visibly falling throughout the scene. There is no main subject in the video; the focus is instead on the tranquil residential scenery, with the slick, reflective road mirroring the sky and enhancing the immersive view down the rain-slicked street.",

    "Motion": "This video features a forward-moving camera capturing a quiet, wet residential street in Japan on a rainy day. Modern houses and parked cars, including a red Mini Cooper, line the narrow, glistening road. The overall atmosphere is calm and peaceful under an overcast sky.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a quiet, rainy day on a narrow residential street in a Japanese suburb. The wet asphalt road reflects the overcast sky, with rain visibly falling throughout the scene. Modern two-story houses, one dark gray and another light gray, line the street. On the left, a red Mini Cooper is parked in a lot with three empty spaces separating it from a silver car. On the right, a black Toyota Prius and a black minivan are parked in front of a house, with the minivan situated under a simple white carport. Utility poles and power lines run along the right side of the street, and small green trees and bushes are planted alongside the properties.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
