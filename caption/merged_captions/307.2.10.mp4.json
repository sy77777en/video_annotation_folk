  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot, a Black man with medium-length hair styled in small braids is positioned in the center-right of the frame in the middle ground, silhouetted by a bright light source directly in front of him. This intensely bright, white light fixture, which has dangling wires, rotates steadily in a clockwise direction. The camera performs a smooth, counterclockwise arc around this glowing device, gradually bringing the man towards the center of the frame. In front of these elements, a black projector sits in the bottom-center of the frame, casting a focused, greenish-yellow beam of light off the left side of the frame. The scene is set in a dark, bare room with a grainy, greenish-yellow color cast, dominated by the powerful central light. In the background, a door is visible against the far wall opposite the camera. The camera, using a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp, captures the scene from the subject's level. As the camera zooms out, computer screen borders become visible at the edges, revealing that the video is a screen recording.",

    "Camera": "This eye-level, level-angle shot uses a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. The camera performs a smooth, counterclockwise arc around a bright, glowing device in the center. As the camera zooms out, it reveals that the video is a screen recording, with computer screen borders appearing at the edges.",
    "Subject": "A Black man with medium-length hair styled in small braids is seen as a silhouette sitting in front of an intensely bright, white light source that creates a significant flare and rotates clockwise while emitting light. In front of the man is a black projector, which casts a focused, greenish-yellow beam of light toward the left. Above the central bright light, another light fixture with dangling wires hangs from the ceiling.",
    "Motion": "A bright, white light source in the middleground of the frame rotates steadily in a clockwise direction. A person sits motionless in silhouette in front of the rotating light. A projector remains stationary, continuously casting a focused, greenish-yellow beam of light toward the left side of the scene.",
    "Scene": "In a dark, bare room with a grainy, greenish-yellow color cast, a powerful, bright white light dominates the center of the scene. This light originates from a device on a stand, from which a focused beam of greenish-yellow light also projects across the room to the left. A person is silhouetted by the intense central glow, positioned next to the device. Thin wires hang from the ceiling above, and as the camera zooms out, computer screen borders become visible at the edges, revealing that the video is a screen recording.",
    "Spatial": "In a medium shot, a person is positioned in the center-right of the frame in the middle ground, with a bright light source directly in front of them. This light fixture, which has dangling wires, rotates clockwise, and the camera moves counterclockwise around it, gradually bringing the person towards the center of the frame. In front of these elements, a projector sits in the bottom-center of the frame, casting a focused, greenish-yellow beam of light off the left side of the frame. In the background, a door is visible against the far wall opposite the camera. The camera is dynamic, capturing the scene from the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
