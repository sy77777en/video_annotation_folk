  "merged_caption": "The video uses a wide shot, capturing both the shoes and the suitcase in full view within the frame. Initially, the shoes are positioned near the bottom left of the frame in the middleground, while the blue suitcase sits further to the right, also in the middleground, with its open lid facing upward and some light-colored fabric visible inside. The background consists of a blue, textured wall with white, louvered closet doors on the center-left and a beige electrical outlet to the right of the closet doors. The video takes place indoors in a sparsely furnished room with wooden floorboards, and the lighting suggests daytime with soft, even illumination and no strong shadows. The pair of dark brown, worn leather shoes starts by standing together on the floor outside the open suitcase. The shoes then move across the floor and step into the medium-sized, rectangular suitcase on their own. Once the shoes are inside the suitcase, the lid begins to close over them. The suitcase remains stationary throughout the video, except for its lid moving as it closes. As the video progresses, the shoes move from their initial spot toward the suitcase, crossing the floor from the left side of the frame into the suitcase, which remains stationary. Once the shoes enter the suitcase, they are visible inside it, and the suitcase lid begins to close over them. Throughout the video, the camera maintains a ground-level perspective, without tilting or panning, and employs a shallow depth of field, with the focus set on the midground where the shoes and suitcase are located. The spatial relationship between the shoes and suitcase shifts from separated to combined, with the shoes transitioning from outside to inside the suitcase.",

    "Camera": "This stop-motion video is captured from a static, ground-level camera with a level angle. It employs a shallow depth of field, with the focus set on the midground where the shoes and suitcase are located.",
    "Subject": "The video features a pair of dark brown, worn leather shoes and a blue hard-shell suitcase with a completely open lid. The shoes are positioned upright and close together. The suitcase is medium-sized, rectangular, and sits on the floor with its lid propped open, revealing a glimpse of light-colored clothing or fabric inside. Initially, the shoes are seen outside the suitcase. Then, they appear to move inside the suitcase on their own, and as they finally enter, the lid begins to close over them. No people or other living beings are visible, and the focus remains on the shoes and suitcase as the primary subjects.",

    "Scene": "The video takes place indoors in a sparsely furnished room with wooden floorboards and a blue, textured wall. A set of white, louvered closet doors is centered against the back wall, and a beige electrical outlet is visible nearby. The lighting suggests daytime, with soft, even illumination and no strong shadows. On the floor, a dark brown, worn pair of shoes and a blue suitcase with a hard shell are present; the suitcase is completely open, revealing some light-colored fabric inside. The shoes and suitcase are positioned apart from each other. As the video proceeds, the shoes gradually move into the suitcase on their own, and then the lid is about to close. No overlays, text, or additional visual elements are present.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
