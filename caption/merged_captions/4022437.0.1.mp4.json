  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a wide shot that frames the entire Mercedes S550 in the center of the image, positioned in the middle ground, with the paved parking lot occupying the foreground and low industrial buildings and trees in the background. The car is viewed from the rear left corner, with both left-side doors open, and the camera is at the same height as the car, providing a level perspective. The camera is positioned at ground level with a level angle, looking straight ahead, and uses deep focus to keep all elements in the scene, including the Benz and its surroundings, sharply in focus. As the video progresses, the camera moves forward slowly and smoothly, slightly panning right as it approaches the Benz, transitioning to a close-up shot that focuses on the left rear wheel, which now dominates the center and lower part of the frame in the foreground. In this close-up, the Mercedes and AMG badges, as well as the Continental branding on the tire, are clearly visible, while the rest of the car and the background buildings shift out of focus or move partially out of frame, emphasizing the wheel as the primary subject. The car's sleek black exterior contrasts with its tan leather interior, and its large, silver alloy wheels feature a five-spoke pattern. The glossy exterior reflects the surroundings, and the pavement is textured with visible aggregate and marked by white painted lines. A few buildings can be seen in the background, adding context to the setting, which includes low, light-colored industrial buildings and a few trees, with a clear sky and soft daylight suggesting late morning or afternoon. Throughout the video, the camera maintains its height at the level of the car, and the spatial relationship between the car and the background elements remains consistent, with only the shot size and subject prominence changing as the camera moves closer.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at ground level with a level angle, looking straight ahead, and uses deep focus to keep all elements in the scene, including the Benz and its surroundings, sharply in focus. It moves forward slowly and smoothly, slightly panning right as it approaches the Benz, with no shaking or instability.",
    "Subject": "The video showcases a Mercedes S550, viewed from the rear left corner. The camera begins with a wide shot of the entire car before move forwards to focus in on the left rear wheel. In this close-up, the Mercedes and AMG badges are clearly visible, along with the Continental branding on the tire.

    "Motion": "The Mercedes S550 remains stationary throughout the video. The camera first captures a wide shot of the entire car from the rear left corner, then moves forward to focus on the left rear wheel, but the car itself does not move.",
    "Scene": "The video takes place outdoors in a paved parking lot bordered by low, light-colored industrial buildings and a few trees, with a clear sky and soft daylight suggesting late morning or afternoon. A black sedan with both the front and rear doors on the left side open is parked on the lot, its glossy exterior reflecting the surroundings. The car’s wheels are silver with a five-spoke design and a metallic finish, featuring a prominent circular emblem at the center. The pavement is textured with visible aggregate and marked by white painted lines. In the background, additional buildings and a few residential structures are visible, contributing to an urban or suburban setting. No overlays, text, or digital elements are present in the video.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
