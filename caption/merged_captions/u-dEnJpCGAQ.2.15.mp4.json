  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot, a lioness with a tawny coat and a slightly lighter underbelly is initially positioned in the center-right of the frame, occupying the foreground. Her bright amber eyes, accentuated by a ring of black, and a small portion of her tongue are visible. Her ears are perked up, and her facial features are defined, with a prominent nose and whiskers. The camera is positioned at hip level with a level angle, focusing on the lioness using a shallow depth of field. The camera tilts up and pans right, with slight unsteadiness and some shaking, causing the lioness's head to transition to the center-left of the frame. The lioness exhibits subtle movements as she breathes and occasionally turns her head to the left, maintaining a calm and composed posture throughout. Behind her, in the background, the dark, textured trunks of a large tree fill the left side and top of the frame, providing a contrasting backdrop to her tawny fur. The scene is well-lit, suggesting daytime, with the sunlight highlighting the textures and colors of her coat. The ground beneath her is earthy, contributing to the calm and serene atmosphere, with no visible movement or changes in the environment. The camera movement adds a dynamic element to the scene, capturing the lioness at eye level.",

    "Motion": "The video features a lioness lying down against a background of dark, weathered wood. The camera tilts upward and pans to the right, capturing the lioness's face and upper body in detail, though with some noticeable unsteadiness and shaking. The lioness exhibits subtle movements as she breathes and occasionally turns her head to the left, maintaining a calm and composed posture throughout.",
    "Scene": "The video captures an outdoor setting in a natural environment, featuring a lioness resting on the ground. The background consists of large, dark tree trunks, providing a contrasting backdrop to the lioness's tawny fur. The scene is well-lit, suggesting daytime, with the sunlight highlighting the textures and colors of the lioness's coat. The lioness is positioned prominently in the foreground, lying down with a relaxed posture. The ground beneath her is earthy, contributing to the calm and serene atmosphere, with no visible movement or changes in the environment.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
