  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a bird's-eye view, transitioning to an upside-down high-angle perspective as the camera moves downward. The person's legs are positioned at the bottom center in the foreground, while their feet, in light blue flip-flops, are in the lower center of the middle ground. The right arm, covered by a light-colored sleeve and adorned with a dark bracelet, extends from the bottom right towards the center of the frame in the foreground. A large pile of rectangular red bricks, many of which are broken and have a rough, textured surface, dominates the top and center of the frame in the middle ground. In the middle ground, a shallow, wide, light-colored bowl containing a dark grey residue is located in the center-left, and the light-brown, fibrous bristles of a traditional broom are visible in the top left corner. A thin white wire is tangled among the bricks in the top right. The person is standing and bending over in a first-person perspective, extending their right hand over the pile of bricks to pick up a red brick. The camera's height shifts from eye level to hip level, maintaining a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. The scene captures an outdoor work site during the day, with the ground consisting of uneven, reddish-brown earth littered with debris.",

    "Camera": "The video starts with a bird's-eye view and transitions to a high-angle perspective that appears upside down as the camera moves downward. A person reaches to pick up a brick, with the camera's height shifting from eye level to hip level. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "From a first-person perspective, a person with a light to medium skin tone is visible, wearing a long-sleeved, light-colored shirt with the sleeves rolled up to just below the elbow, and blue flip-flops. A black bracelet is on their right wrist, and their right hand is extended toward a large, disorganized pile of reddish-orange clay bricks on the dirt ground. Some of the bricks are broken. To the left of the person's feet sits a shallow, wide, light-colored bowl containing a dark grey residue. In the upper left, the light-brown, fibrous bristles of a traditional broom are visible.",
    "Motion": "The person is standing and bending over in a first-person perspective, extending their right hand over a pile of bricks to pick up a red brick.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a scene at an outdoor work site during the day. The ground consists of uneven, reddish-brown earth littered with debris. A large pile of rectangular red bricks, many of which are broken and have a rough, textured surface, occupies the center of the view. Near the person's feet, which are in light blue flip-flops, rests a shallow, grey, circular basin containing some residue. In the upper left, the light-brown, fibrous bristles of a traditional broom are visible, while a thin white wire is tangled among the bricks. The person's arm, covered by a light-colored sleeve and adorned with a dark bracelet, extends towards the pile of bricks.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
