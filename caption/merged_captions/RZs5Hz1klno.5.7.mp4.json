  "merged_caption": "This is an extreme wide, aerial scenery shot filmed by a drone over a vast, arid landscape under a hazy, pink-hued sky at either dawn or dusk. The camera is positioned high above the terrain, which features dark, reddish-brown earth with sparse vegetation and low, rolling hills on the horizon. Initially, a dirt track is visible in the foreground at the bottom of the frame, leading towards the middle ground. The camera begins at an overhead level, moving forward and upward, gradually approaching a large, fenced-in facility in the distance, identified as Pine Gap. This complex is distinguished by several prominent, white, spherical radomes alongside other low-profile buildings, situated in the center of the middle ground. As the altitude increases, the camera tilts downward, transitioning to a high-angle perspective that captures the entire complex, emphasizing the remote and expansive setting. Rolling hills form the background, with the hazy, pink sky occupying the top half of the frame. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire landscape sharp and clear. As the camera glides forward and appears to gain altitude, moving over the landscape towards the distant facility, a persistent white text overlay appears in the lower-left corner, identifying the location as \"Pine Gap\" with its corresponding geographical coordinates, along with the text \"[13,16];©OpenStreetMap.\" The slow aerial movement and atmospheric lighting emphasize the desolate and mysterious quality of the location, with no single main subject, as the focus is placed on the immense scale and isolation of the environment.",

    "Camera": "This is a smooth, aerial drone shot. The camera begins at an overhead level and moves forward and upward, approaching a facility in the distance. As it gains altitude, it tilts down, transitioning to a high-angle perspective to capture the entire complex. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire landscape sharp and clear.",
    "Subject": "This is an aerial landscape scenery shot capturing a vast, arid expanse under a hazy, pink-hued sky. The camera glides over rolling, brownish hills and sparse vegetation, following dirt tracks that lead towards a remote facility in the distance, identified as Pine Gap. This complex is distinguished by a series of large, white, spherical domes. There is no single main subject, as the focus is placed on the immense scale and isolation of the environment, with the slow aerial movement and atmospheric lighting emphasizing the desolate and mysterious quality of the location.",
    "Motion": "This video showcases a seamless aerial drone shot over the Pine Gap facility in Australia. The camera begins at an overhead level, moving forward and upward, gradually approaching the facility set against a hazy, reddish-pink sky at dawn or dusk. As the altitude increases, the camera tilts downward, transitioning to a high-angle perspective that captures the entire complex. The scene includes the arid, hilly landscape with sparse vegetation, a dirt road leading towards the facility, and close-ups of the distinctive white, spherical radomes, emphasizing the remote and expansive setting.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone moves forward over a vast, arid landscape under a hazy, pink sky at either dawn or dusk. The terrain features dark, reddish-brown earth with sparse vegetation and low, rolling hills on the horizon. A straight dirt track leads from the foreground toward a large, fenced-in facility in the distance. This compound contains several prominent, white, spherical radomes alongside other low-profile buildings. A persistent white text overlay appears in the lower-left corner, identifying the location as \"Pine Gap\" with its corresponding geographical coordinates, along with the text \"[13,16];©OpenStreetMap.\"",
    "Spatial": "This is an extreme wide, aerial scenery shot. The camera is positioned high above a vast, arid landscape. Initially, a dirt track is visible in the foreground at the bottom of the frame, leading towards the middle ground. In the middle ground, a facility with several white, spherical domes is situated in the center. Rolling hills form the background, with a hazy, pink sky occupying the top half of the frame. The camera glides forward and appears to gain altitude, moving over the landscape towards the distant facility. As the shot progresses, a white text overlay appears in the bottom left corner of the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
