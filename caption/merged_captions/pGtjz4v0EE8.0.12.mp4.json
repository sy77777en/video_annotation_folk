  "merged_caption": "This dynamic, extreme wide shot begins with a slow zoom-in, transitioning to a rapid zoom-in towards the end, offering a high-angle aerial view of the scenery. The turquoise water of a canal fills the foreground and the bottom half of the frame, where several small motorboats travel across the water, creating white wakes behind them, adding dynamic elements to the picturesque cityscape. In the middle ground, more motorboats can be seen navigating the canal. The city of Venice stretches horizontally across the frame, with the prominent white Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute positioned in the center-left and adjacent buildings extending to the right. The background, visible across the top of the frame, contains the distant cityscape and industrial port cranes, adding depth to the composition. The scene captures a wide view of Venice, Italy, on a cloudy day, with the city's dense architecture featuring buildings with terracotta-tiled roofs. Dominating the skyline is the large, white stone Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute with its prominent dome, situated next to the long, low-lying Punta della Dogana building. The cityscape stretches into the distance, where industrial port cranes are visible under a pale blue sky with light cloud cover and shadows cast by the sun. This smooth, aerial time-lapse video of Venice is captured from a high angle with a deep focus, keeping the entire cityscape sharp. The camera performs a slow zoom-in, which accelerates into a rapid zoom at the very end. The focus is on the overall environment and the interplay between the water and the dense, historic urban landscape, emphasizing the grand scale and unique atmosphere of the iconic city.",

    "Camera": "This smooth, aerial time-lapse video of Venice is captured from a high angle with a deep focus, keeping the entire cityscape sharp. The camera performs a slow zoom-in, which accelerates into a rapid zoom at the very end.",
    "Subject": "This video presents an extreme wide cityscape scenery shot, capturing an expansive aerial view of Venice, Italy. The scene is dominated by the vibrant blue-green water of a major canal, with several small motorboats creating white wakes as they traverse its surface. Along the waterfront, the city's historic architecture is on full display, featuring a prominent white stone basilica with a large dome, adjacent buildings with red-tiled roofs, and a distant bell tower. There is no single main subject, as the composition is intentionally broad to emphasize the grand scale and unique atmosphere of the iconic city. The focus is on the overall environment and the interplay between the water and the dense, historic urban landscape.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenic, wide-angle shot of Venice, Italy. The view captures the city's iconic architecture, including a prominent domed basilica, situated along the bright blue water of a major canal. The scene is animated by boats moving across the water, creating white wakes behind them, adding dynamic elements to the picturesque cityscape.",
    "Scene": "From a high, observational vantage point, the scene captures a wide view of Venice, Italy, on a cloudy day. The turquoise waters of a wide canal fill the foreground, with several motorboats creating white wakes as they travel across its surface. On the far bank, the city's dense architecture features buildings with terracotta-tiled roofs. Dominating the skyline is the large, white stone Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute with its prominent dome, situated next to the long, low-lying Punta della Dogana building. The cityscape stretches into the distance, where industrial port cranes are visible under a pale blue sky with light cloud cover and shadows cast by the sun.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
