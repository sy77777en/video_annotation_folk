  "merged_caption": "This is a scenery shot from a first-person perspective, presented as a wide shot. The camera is positioned at the top of a descending narrow stairway, with towering tiled walls on the left and right sides and a tiled floor beneath. These surfaces lead to the middle ground, where the stairway ends and opens into another area, partially obscured by a bright, hazy mist that reveals the tiled pattern continues. The camera moves steadily forward, giving the impression that the walls and floor are advancing from the middle ground to the foreground. The scene features curved edges due to barrel distortion of the camera. The camera movement is slightly unsteady, simulating natural motion, and maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire tiled environment sharp. The shot captures a first-person perspective of a long, narrow corridor. The walls, floor, and ceiling are uniformly covered in small, off-white tiles, creating a disorienting grid pattern that recedes into a hazy, indistinct distance. The camera moves steadily forward through the sterile-looking space. The focus is on the disorienting and vast scale of the environment itself, creating an eerie, liminal atmosphere rather than highlighting a specific subject. Every surface, including the steps and the towering parallel walls, is covered in a uniform grid of small, pale yellowish-green tiles with dark grout lines. The space is filled with a thick, hazy fog that obscures the view into the room, and the scene is bathed in a diffuse, sourceless light of the same sickly green-yellow hue, enhancing the unsettling and sterile quality of the location. The perspective is slightly distorted with darkened, curved edges, as if viewed from inside a mask or through a wide-angle lens.",

    "Camera": "This is a first-person point-of-view shot from an eye-level, level angle, moving forward and descending a set of stairs. The camera movement is slightly unsteady, simulating natural motion. The shot features mild barrel distortion and maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire tiled environment sharp.",
    "Subject": "This is an architectural scenery shot depicting a narrow, descending staircase that leads into a room beyond. The focus is on the disorienting and vast scale of the environment itself, creating an eerie, liminal atmosphere rather than highlighting a specific subject.

    "Motion": "This scenery shot captures a first-person perspective of a long, narrow corridor. The walls, floor, and ceiling are uniformly covered in small, off-white tiles, creating a disorienting grid pattern that recedes into a hazy, indistinct distance. The camera moves steadily forward through the sterile-looking space.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves down a relatively short and narrow descending staircase. The walls, floor, and ceiling are completely covered in small, square, off-white tiles with dark grout, creating a uniform grid pattern throughout the space. The staircase is illuminated by a diffuse, yellowish-green light, and beyond the bright, hazy mist at the bottom, the space continues with the same design, maintaining the uniform grid pattern.",
    "Spatial": "This is a scenery shot from a first-person perspective, presented as a wide shot.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
