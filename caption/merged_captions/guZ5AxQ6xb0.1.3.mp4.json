  "merged_caption": "In a full shot captured from below the subject, a surfer is positioned in the center-right of the frame, situated in the middle ground. The surfer is viewed through the translucent, turbulent water of a wave's barrel, which occupies the foreground and the top half of the frame. The surfboard extends from the surfer's position towards the bottom-right corner. The bottom portion of the frame is filled with churning, foamy water. Throughout the shot, the surfer and surfboard are moving towards the bottom-right direction of the frame, with the spray from the tail of the surfboard extending from the top-left to the bottom-right direction. Filmed in slow-motion, this video captures a surfer riding a wave with an underwater camera positioned at a low angle. The camera tilts upward and rolls slightly counterclockwise, adding dynamic movement to the shot, while employing deep focus to keep the entire underwater scene in clear view. From an underwater perspective, a surfer on a surfboard glides from left to right, riding inside the curl of a breaking wave. The surfer maintains a stable crouching position with arms extended, making slight adjustments to their balance as they move through the turbulent water. From an underwater perspective inside a breaking wave, a person is seen surfing. Their figure is blurred and distorted by the turbulent water. The surfer is standing on a dark-colored surfboard, the underside of which is visible, revealing two black fins as it moves across the water. An underwater view from beneath a large, breaking ocean wave captures a surfer in motion. The water is a translucent blue, with bright sunlight illuminating the scene from above, filtering through the curved, bubbly surface of the wave. The water's surface is textured and distorted, while the area below the board is darker and more turbulent, with white foam churning and swirling, creating a dynamic and energetic scene.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
