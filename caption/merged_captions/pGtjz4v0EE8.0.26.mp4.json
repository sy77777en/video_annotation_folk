  "merged_caption": "This video captures a wide scenery shot with no specific main subject, focusing on the overall environment. The shot begins with a fast motion blur of light streaks moving from right to left, which quickly resolves into a stable, eye-level time-lapse. In this view, the illuminated Colosseum in Rome stands majestically in the middle ground, occupying the center and left of the frame, highlighted by warm, golden lights against a deep blue twilight sky. A road with flowing light streaks from traffic curves across the foreground from the bottom left to the lower right midground, encircling the Colosseum. The motion in the scene is created by traffic, which appears as long, flowing streaks of white, yellow, and red light due to a time-lapse or long-exposure effect. A tall streetlight stands in the foreground on the right side of the frame, casting an orange glow on the pavement and sidewalk, where a few people can be seen walking. Trees and vaguely visible houses occupy the right side, extending from the foreground to the background. The camera, positioned at a low angle, eye-level perspective, smoothly zooms in on the ancient structure, using an extreme fisheye lens that creates strong visual distortion and enhances the grandeur of the architecture. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp and clear. The scene captures the contrast between the fast-paced present, represented by the constant motion of city life, and the enduring historical monument.",

    "Camera": "This is a time-lapse video of the Colosseum at night, captured with an extreme fisheye lens that creates strong visual distortion. The camera is positioned at a low angle, eye-level perspective and smoothly zooms in on the ancient structure. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp and clear.",
    "Subject": "This video captures a dynamic cityscape scenery shot, focusing on the overall atmosphere and environment rather than a specific main subject. The scene is a time-lapse of the ancient Colosseum in Rome, which stands majestically illuminated by warm, golden lights against a dark twilight sky. A wide-angle, fisheye lens creates a sweeping, distorted perspective that enhances the grandeur of the architecture. In the foreground, the constant motion of city life is represented by long, flowing streaks of white, yellow, and red light from passing vehicles, creating a stark and beautiful contrast between the fast-paced present and the enduring historical monument.",
    "Motion": "This is a dynamic, wide-angle scenery shot of the Colosseum in Rome at night, illuminated with golden lights against a deep blue twilight sky. The motion in the scene is created by traffic, which appears as long, flowing streaks of light due to a time-lapse or long-exposure effect. The camera captures the iconic landmark from a low angle on a busy street.",
    "Scene": "A night time-lapse captures the Colosseum in Rome from a low, wide-angle roadside perspective. The ancient stone amphitheater is illuminated from below by warm, golden lights that highlight its tiered arches against a deep blue and black sky. In the foreground, long, bright streaks of white, yellow, and red light from moving traffic flow along the curved road. A streetlight on the right side of the scene casts an orange glow on the pavement and sidewalk, where a few people can be seen walking. Trees are visible in the middle ground on the right.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
