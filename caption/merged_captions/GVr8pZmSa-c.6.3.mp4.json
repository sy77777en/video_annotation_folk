  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot, focusing on a section of embossed text on a dark, textured surface, possibly metallic or stone, with characters resembling Greek letters. The characters in the right-central area of the frame are most prominent and in sharp focus, while the text on the left is initially unclear. The dark surface itself forms the immediate background to these raised characters, which appear slightly weathered with a cool, bluish-grey tone. The lighting is dim, casting subtle highlights on the raised letters. The camera features mild barrel distortion and is at a level angle, using a shallow depth of field to consistently keep the foreground of the monument in focus. The camera then moves in a smooth clockwise arc, approximately a quarter circle, transitioning to a full shot from the front of the surface. As the camera arcs, it gradually reveals a full view of the object from a distance ahead, effectively pulling the camera's perspective back. In this wider view, the whole inscription becomes the center, revealing more lines of the embossed text which now appear smaller within the frame, allowing the viewer to see a broader context of the inscription. The camera movement is very smooth, and there is no subject movement in the frame. The overall color palette is cool and desaturated, predominantly dark grey or a muted blue, with some areas appearing lighter, almost like a thin layer of frost or dust, particularly around the embossed letters. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout this transition, providing a comprehensive view of the ancient script with its three-dimensional effect and subtle shadows.",

    "Camera": "The video features mild barrel distortion. The camera is at a level angle. It uses a shallow depth of field, consistently keeping the foreground of the monument in focus throughout the video. The camera follows a clockwise arc motion, approximately a quarter circle, to reveal the monument from a closer side view to a further front angle. The camera movement is very smooth.",
    "Subject": "The video begins with a close-up view of a dark, metallic-looking surface, possibly stone or metal, featuring embossed text. The text is arranged in horizontal lines and appears to be an ancient script, with characters resembling Greek letters. These characters are raised from the surface, creating a three-dimensional effect with subtle shadows. The surface itself has a slightly weathered or textured appearance, with some areas appearing lighter, almost like a thin layer of frost or dust, particularly around the embossed letters. As the video progresses, the camera arcs clockwise, gradually revealing a full view of the object from a distance ahead. The overall color palette is cool and desaturated, predominantly dark grey or a muted blue.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a close-up of embossed text on a dark, static and textured surface. The camera then moves in a smooth clockwise arc, transitioning to a full shot from the front of the surface. There is no subject movement in the frame.",
    "Scene": "The video begins with a close-up of a dark, textured surface, possibly metallic or stone, with lines of embossed, Greek-like characters. The lighting is dim, casting subtle highlights on the raised letters, which appear slightly weathered. The surface has a cool, bluish-grey tone.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
