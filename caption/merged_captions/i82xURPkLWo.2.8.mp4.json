  "merged_caption": "In a static extreme wide shot, a light-skinned man with a bald head or very short blond hair and a muscular build is positioned in the middle ground, walking at a steady pace from the right side of the frame to the left along a long, straight boardwalk constructed from metal and concrete with light-colored railings and a dark walking surface on pilings. The boardwalk extends horizontally across the scene over a vast coastal marshland, which dominates the foreground and middle ground. The expansive, flat landscape is covered in brown and tan marsh grasses, interspersed with channels of calm water. The sky, filling the top half of the frame, is filled with scattered clouds tinged with warm orange and yellow hues, suggesting either sunrise or sunset. A line of trees is visible in the background on the far left. The camera is positioned above the man, in a static, overhead shot taken from a level angle, approximately at the height of a second floor, using a deep focus to keep the entire landscape and the person on the bridge sharp and clear. The man is wearing a dark reddish tank top and dark pants. Text reading \"Buttermilk Sound, GA\" is superimposed in the bottom right corner, identifying the location.",

    "Subject": "A light-skinned man with a bald head or very short blond hair and a muscular build is shown walking from right to left across a long concrete and steel boardwalk. He is wearing a dark reddish tank top and dark pants. The text \"Buttermilk Sound, GA\" is displayed in white at the bottom right of the scene.",
    "Motion": "A man walks at a steady pace from right to left along a metal and concrete boardwalk that extends over a wide marsh.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set in a vast coastal marshland at either sunrise or sunset, under a sky filled with scattered clouds tinged with warm orange and yellow hues. An overlay in the lower right identifies the location as \"Buttermilk Sound, GA.\" The expansive, flat landscape is covered in brown and tan marsh grasses, interspersed with channels of calm water. A long, straight boardwalk, constructed from metal and concrete with light-colored railings and a dark walking surface on pilings, extends across the marsh. A person is walking from right to left along this boardwalk. In the distance, a line of trees is visible on the left horizon.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
