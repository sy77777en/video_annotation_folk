  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of a rhinoceros positioned in the center of the middle ground, walking away from the camera and moving forward. In the foreground, several water jets spray upward from behind a low concrete wall, while a small pool of water is visible in the bottom right. Large rocks are arranged across the middle ground, with trees also in the middle ground and a building with a light green wall partially visible in the background. The camera, from an eye-level angle, smoothly pans left, revealing a second rhinoceros standing still in the middle ground on the left side of the enclosure, facing toward the left and eating grass. The enclosure features a small, muddy pool of water on the right and another small pool on the left. The scene is set against a backdrop of lush, green-leafed trees during the daytime. Several sprinklers in the scene are spraying water into a puddle. The shot concludes as a wide shot with the second rhinoceros on the left and the first rhinoceros on the far right, both remaining in the middle ground. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp and is positioned at the subjects' level throughout the video.",

    "Subject": "The video opens on the rear of a large, gray rhinoceros with thick, folded skin as it walks forward away from the camera. As the rhinoceros moves, the camera pans to the left, revealing a second, similar-looking rhinoceros standing still on the left side of the enclosure. This second rhinoceros is also large and gray with wrinkled skin and is positioned facing toward the left. The enclosure features a small, muddy pool of water, large rocks, and several sprinklers spraying water.",
    "Motion": "A rhinoceros walks forward away from the camera in its enclosure. As it moves, the camera pans to the left, revealing a second rhinoceros standing and eating grass on the left side of the enclosure, facing toward the left. Several sprinklers in the scene are spraying water into a puddle.",
    "Scene": "An outdoor animal enclosure is seen during the daytime, set against a backdrop of lush, green-leafed trees. The ground is mostly dirt, with large, dark grey rocks forming part of the landscape. A simple building with a light green wall is partially visible behind the trees. Within the enclosure, two large, grey rhinoceroses are present. The scene features a small, muddy pool of water on the right and another small pool on the left. In the foreground, near the camera and in front of a low concrete wall, several water jets spray upward. The camera pans slightly to the left, revealing the second rhinoceros standing near the rocks.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
