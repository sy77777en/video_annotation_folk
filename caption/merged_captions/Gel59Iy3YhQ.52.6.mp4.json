  "merged_caption": "The scene is captured in a wide shot from an oblique top-down perspective, where a small, stylized, glowing blue creature with a fox-like appearance and pointed ears is positioned in the center of the frame, surrounded by several small, black, insectoid or bat-like enemies with glowing red eyes and markings. The background is lined with rock formations and lit candles along the top and left perimeter of the dark, enclosed arena, which is cast in a strong purple and red glow. As the action begins, the blue player character moves and dodges around the central space, firing straight red projectiles at the black enemies, which move around and shoot straight red laser beams. When hit, the enemies explode and transform into clusters of blue-white bubbles. Throughout the fight, arcs of blue, electric-like energy appear and fade on the floor, forming small, glowing constellations. The camera, from a top-down gaming point of view, quickly and dynamically tracks the character during combat, shaking noticeably whenever the character is attacked. More enemies spawn at the bottom of the screen, and the player character moves toward them. Projectiles like red laser beams and blue energy arcs traverse the frame. Throughout the clip, UI elements remain fixed as overlays in the bottom-left and top-right corners of the foreground, featuring three vertical white bars, icons of a sword, a bomb, a blue orb, and several small red hearts, alongside changing numerical values. A circular targeting reticle with a health bar appears on different enemies as the blue player character changes targets.",

    "Camera": "From a top-down gaming point of view, the camera quickly and dynamically tracks a character during combat. The camera movement is slightly unsteady, shaking noticeably whenever the character is attacked.",
    "Subject": "In a video game scene, the player character is a small, stylized, glowing blue creature with a fox-like appearance and pointed ears. It is surrounded by several small, black, insectoid or bat-like enemies that have glowing red eyes and markings. The combat is visualized with brightly colored projectiles, including straight red laser beams, clusters of white bubbly projectiles, and arcs of blue, electric-like energy that form small, glowing constellations on the dark purple floor. A user interface is present, featuring three vertical white bars in the bottom-left corner, and icons representing a sword, a bomb, a blue orb, and several small red hearts in the top-right corner.",
    "Motion": "A small, blue, fox-like creature moves and dodges around a dark arena, firing straight red projectiles. It is engaged in combat with several small, black, insectoid enemies that move around the space and shoot straight red laser beams. When the enemies are hit by the red laser beams, they explode and transform into clusters of blue-white bubbles. Throughout the fight, arcs of blue, electric-like energy appear and fade on the floor.",
    "Scene": "In a gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view, where the camera is placed directly above the character and looks down on them, the action unfolds in a dark, enclosed arena. The entire scene is cast in a strong purple and red glow. The perimeter of the combat area is lined with rock-like formations and numerous lit candles. A small, glowing blue character moves around the space, battling several small, black, winged enemies. The combat is filled with vibrant particle effects, including red laser beams, blue electrical discharges, and bright explosions that scatter across the floor. The video features several overlay elements. In the bottom-left corner are three vertical bars. A heads-up display in the top-right corner shows icons of a sword, a blue orb, and hearts, alongside changing numerical values. A circular targeting reticle with a health bar also appears over enemies.",
    "Spatial": "The scene is captured in a wide shot from an oblique top-down perspective. Initially, the blue player character is positioned in the center of the frame, in the middle ground, surrounded by several black enemies. The background is lined with rock formations and lit candles along the top and left perimeter of the arena. As the action begins, the player character and enemies move dynamically around the central space, with projectiles like red laser beams and blue energy arcs traversing the frame. More enemies spawn at the bottom of the screen, and the player character moves toward them. Throughout the clip, UI elements remain fixed as overlays in the bottom-left and top-right corners of the foreground, while a circular targeting reticle appears on different enemies as the blue player character changes targets."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
