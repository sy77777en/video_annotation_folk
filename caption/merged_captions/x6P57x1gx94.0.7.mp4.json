  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a level-angle wide shot from a fisheye lens, showing a man on a skateboard in the center-frame middle ground, positioned on a large pink ramp that dominates the foreground. The man, wearing a white t-shirt and dark pants, is the central focus throughout, showcasing his skateboarding skills. The scene is set in a sunlit urban plaza on a clear day, surrounded by multi-story buildings, including a modern white structure with numerous windows, all under a blue sky with a few clouds. The fisheye lens distorts the view, causing the straight lines of the architecture and the horizon to appear curved. As the skateboarder moves toward the left, the camera actively follows him, first trucking left and tilting up as he jumps onto a flat section of the curved pink ramp toward the camera. His hand comes very close to the edge of his board during the jump. The framing transitions to a full shot before he takes the jump, which carries him directly over the camera's position. The camera maintains a level perspective with a varying Dutch angle due to camera rolling. After landing on the paved plaza, the angle returns to level as he skates away from the camera into the center of the plaza, which now occupies the middle ground. The camera pans left and trucks right after he passes, ending at eye level relative to him, though it does not physically move upward. His figure diminishes in size as he recedes into the background, returning the scene to a wide shot. Throughout the clip, buildings occupy the background, their architectural lines appearing curved due to the lens distortion. The video employs a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",

    "Camera": "This slightly unsteady video is shot with a noticeable fisheye lens, creating curved distortion. The camera starts at ground level and maintains a level perspective with a varying Dutch angle due to camera rolling. As the skateboarder moves to a lower surface, the camera appears to end at eye level relative to him, though it does not physically move upward. It employs a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera actively follows the skateboarder, first trucking left and tilting up as he jumps, then panning left and trucking right after he passes.",
    "Subject": "The video features a man skateboarding. He is wearing a white t-shirt and dark pants. Initially, he is seen approaching the camera, performing a jump on his skateboard. After landing, he continues to skate away from the camera. The man is the central focus throughout, showcasing his skateboarding skills.",
    "Motion": "A man on a skateboard jumps onto a flat section of a curved pink ramp toward the camera. He then jumps off the side of the ramp, with his hand coming very close to the edge of his board during the jump. He lands on a paved plaza and skates away from the camera.",
    "Scene": "Shot from a low, wide-angle fisheye perspective, the scene is set in a sunlit urban plaza on a clear day. A large, bright pink, U-shaped structure with white sides stands prominently on the light-colored tiled pavement. The plaza is surrounded by multi-story buildings, including a modern white structure with numerous windows, all seen under a blue sky with a few clouds. The fisheye lens distorts the view, causing the straight lines of the architecture and the horizon to appear curved. A person on a skateboard moves from the pink structure out into the open space of the plaza.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
