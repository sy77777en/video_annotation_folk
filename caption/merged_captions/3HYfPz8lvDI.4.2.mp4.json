  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide shot of a modern office, viewed through a rectangular opening in a brown brick wall that occupies the foreground. The video focuses on the environmental transformation of the space. Initially, the middle ground contains an easel with an architectural drawing of a house on the left, a sleek white and black desk in the center-left, and a brown leather couch on the right, all set against light-colored, vertically paneled walls. A colorful abstract painting with splashes of blue and red on a black background hangs on the right wall. The camera begins with a brief, intentional backward movement, followed by minor, smooth, and unintentional movement, maintaining a mostly static, level-angle shot with deep focus that keeps the middle ground and background sharp, though the bricks in the foreground lack detail. As the shot progresses, cardboard boxes gradually fade into view across the middle ground, appearing on and around the furniture. The boxes eventually obscure most of the desk, chairs, and couch, while the easel on the left and the painting on the right wall fade out completely, transforming the furnished office into a cluttered space filled with moving boxes. One of the boxes is marked with the letters 'R-F'. Several items, including the whiteboard, the painting, and the lamp on the desk, fade out of sight, suggesting they are being packed into the boxes, signifying that the office is being packed up. An overlay in the bottom-left corner displays the text '[18]'.",

    "Camera": "This is a mostly static, level-angle shot with deep focus that keeps the middleground and background sharp, though the bricks in the foreground lack detail. The camera exhibits a brief, intentional backward movement at the start of the video, followed by minor, smooth, and unintentional movement.",
    "Subject": "This video features an interior scenery shot of a modern office, framed through a large, rectangular opening in a brick wall. The scene's focus is on the environmental transformation of the space rather than a single subject. Initially, the room is furnished with a sleek white and black desk, a brown leather couch, a whiteboard on an easel displaying an architectural drawing, and a painting with splashes of blue and red on a black background on the right wall. As the video progresses, cardboard boxes gradually fade into view, obscuring most of the furniture. Several items, including the whiteboard, the painting, and the lamp on the desk, fade out of sight, suggesting they are being packed into the boxes, signifying that the office is being packed up.",
    "Motion": "This is a static shot of an office viewed through an opening in a brick wall. The office is initially furnished, but then cardboard boxes appear and fill the space, obscuring the furniture. The scene remains still throughout the clip.",
    "Scene": "Viewed through a rectangular opening in a brown brick wall, a modern office with light-colored, vertically paneled walls is initially visible. The space contains a white and dark desk, modern chairs, a brown leather sofa, and a small coffee table. An easel on the left displays an architectural drawing of a house, and a colorful abstract painting hangs on the right wall. The scene transitions as cardboard moving boxes fade into view, gradually filling the room and obscuring the furniture until the office is cluttered with stacked boxes, one of which is marked with the letters 'R-F'. An overlay in the bottom-left corner displays the text '[18]'.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
