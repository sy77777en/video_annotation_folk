  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a level angle shot, showing only the head of a man in a blue beanie in the bottom center. As the camera tilts down and trucks left, it transitions into a high-angle medium shot, revealing a man with light skin and short, reddish-blond hair in a red athletic shirt with a white collar over a red ribbed knit shirt, paired with red shorts featuring the white number \"10\" on the left side. He lies on his back in the bottom-left and center foreground, supporting his head with his right hand and holding his bent right leg with his left hand, wearing a knee-high sock on his left foot. Beside him, a man with light skin in a blue jacket and pants, with sky blue fingerless gloves, sits and slightly shifts his head while looking at him. A hand wearing a light blue glove, attached to an arm in a blue sleeve, inspects the reclining man's exposed foot with a tool in the far-left foreground, next to a white megaphone. The background consists of a dark wall that fills the upper half of the frame, with a yellow lightning bolt graphic in the top-right corner. As the camera tilts down, more of the scene in the foreground is revealed, including the full upper body of the man in blue, more of the reclining man's body, the blue surface they are on, and a silver case positioned to the right of the man in red, on the left side of the frame. The scene takes place indoors, featuring a dark backdrop with a textured surface resembling a night sky or a theatrical set. The environment is dimly lit, with a focus on a small, elevated platform covered in a blue material. The setting suggests a medical or supportive context, with the dark surroundings contrasting against the vivid colors of the clothing and props.",

    "Camera": "The video begins with a level angle perspective, smoothly tilting down and trucking left, transitioning to a high-angle view looking down on the two people. The shot uses deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "A man with light skin and short, reddish-blond hair lies on his back, wearing a red athletic shirt with a white collar over a red ribbed knit shirt, paired with red shorts that feature the white number \"10\" on the left side. He supports his head with his right hand and holds his bent right leg with his left hand, wearing a knee-high sock on his left foot. To his left, on the right side of the frame, another man with light skin sits, wearing a blue jacket paired with blue pants and sky blue fingerless gloves, looking towards the reclining man. On the left, a hand wearing a light blue glove, attached to an arm in a blue sleeve, inspects the reclining man's exposed foot. Initially, only the head of the man in blue is visible at the bottom, but as the view tilts down, more of both men's bodies and the interaction with the foot become apparent.",
    "Motion": "The camera tilts downward to reveal a man in a red uniform lying on his back, holding his knee. Beside him, a man in a blue jacket sits and slightly shifts his head while looking at him. A third person's gloved hand touches the lying man's bare foot with a tool. The two seated individuals remain relatively still throughout the shot.",
    "Scene": "The scene takes place indoors, featuring a dark backdrop with a textured surface resembling a night sky or a theatrical set. The environment is dimly lit, with a focus on a small, elevated platform covered in a blue material. On this platform, a person in a red sports uniform is lying down, holding their knee, while another person in blue attire, including a beanie, sits beside them. The setting suggests a medical or supportive context, with a white megaphone and a silver case nearby, possibly for communication or equipment. The overall atmosphere is intimate and focused, with the dark surroundings contrasting against the vivid colors of the clothing and props.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
