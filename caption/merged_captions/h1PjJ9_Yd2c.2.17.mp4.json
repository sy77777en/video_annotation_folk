  "merged_caption": "The video starts with an over-the-shoulder shot, where the back of a young, light-skinned woman's head and shoulder are out of focus in the foreground on the right. Her clear reflection, framed in a medium shot, is positioned in the middle ground at the center-left of the frame. She is wearing a simple, short-sleeved gray t-shirt and has long, light brown hair pulled back from her face. She holds a light blue spray can with a white cap and wears two black bracelets on her left wrist. In the background, a window is visible in the reflection on the center-right. The scene is set in a bathroom with plain, light-colored walls, and a large, frameless mirror reflects the woman holding the spray can. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout the scene, beginning with a shallow depth of field, focusing on the woman's reflection in the midground. As the woman stands in front of the mirror, looking down while holding the spray can, she then turns her head and body to her left. As she turns, the camera's focus shifts from her reflection to her physical self, causing the reflection to blur. The camera performs a rack focus to the woman's head in the foreground while panning slightly to the right. She is now in focus and seen in profile, revealing her hair is styled in a high ponytail. Consequently, her reflection becomes blurred and shifts to the left side of the frame, while white shelves cluttered with various bottles and toiletries become visible in the background on the right. Daylight enters through a window with white vertical panes, adding natural light to the scene.",

    "Camera": "This eye-level, level-angle shot is slightly unsteady. It begins with a shallow depth of field, focusing on the woman's reflection in the midground. The camera then performs a rack focus to the woman's head in the foreground while panning slightly to the right.",
    "Subject": "The video presents a young, light-skinned woman, filmed from over her shoulder as she stands before a mirror. Initially, the focus is on her clear reflection, which shows her from the waist up. She is wearing a simple, short-sleeved gray t-shirt and has long, light brown hair pulled back from her face. She holds a light blue spray can with a white cap and wears two black bracelets on her left wrist. As she turns to her left, the focus shifts from the reflection to her physical self. Now in focus, she is seen from the side, revealing her hair is styled in a high ponytail. Consequently, her reflection in the mirror becomes blurred.",
    "Motion": "A young woman stands in front of a mirror, looking down while holding a spray can. She then turns her head and body to her left. As she turns, the camera's focus shifts from her reflection to her physical form, causing the reflection to blur.",
    "Scene": "An over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind the character, showing their upper body and the scene ahead, reveals the interior of a bathroom with plain, light-colored walls as seen from the mirror. A large, frameless mirror reflects a young woman holding a light blue spray can with a white cap. In the right part of the mirror, daylight enters through a window with white vertical panes. As the character turns, white shelves cluttered with various bottles and toiletries become visible in the background.",
    "Spatial": "The video starts with an over-the-shoulder shot, where the back of a girl's head and shoulder are out of focus in the foreground on the right.

The girl then turns to her left, and as she does, the camera's focus shifts from the reflection to her physical self. She is now in focus and seen in profile.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
