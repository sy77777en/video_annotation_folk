  "merged_caption": "The video employs a medium close-up shot, focusing on a person seen from behind, whose upper body from the chest up occupies the central foreground and about half the frame's height. The person, a woman with shoulder-length, light-colored hair, is wearing a dark jacket. The ascending escalator extends from the bottom center foreground diagonally upwards towards the center right background. Tiled walls flank the escalator on the left and right sides of the frame, stretching from the foreground into the background. The reflective ceiling fills the top portion of the frame, extending from the foreground towards the background, where fluorescent lights are visible. The entire frame, including the person and camera, moves steadily upwards with the escalator, causing the background elements to gradually approach. The camera is positioned level with the subject, at eye level with a low angle, looking up. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera moves smoothly forward, upward, and to the right, focusing on the woman ascending the escalator. The escalator is enclosed by white tiled walls and has a metallic handrail on the left side. The lighting is bright, with overhead lights casting reflections on the walls. The woman remains stationary on the escalator throughout the sequence, with no significant changes in her posture or the environment. The setting suggests an indoor environment, likely a subway or shopping center, with fluorescent lighting reflecting off the surfaces. The environment is characterized by tiled walls and a metallic ceiling, both reflecting the fluorescent lighting that casts a cool, sterile glow. The scene is devoid of natural light, suggesting it takes place underground. The setting is clean and modern, with a sense of symmetry created by the parallel lines of the walls and ceiling. The overall atmosphere is quiet and functional, typical of a transit space.",

    "Camera": "The video features a camera at eye level with a low angle, looking up. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera moves smoothly forward, upward, and to the right, focusing on a woman ascending an escalator.",
    "Subject": "The video features a person on an ascending escalator, viewed from behind. The person, whose upper body is visible from above the chest, occupies half the height of the frame. They have shoulder-length, light-colored hair and are wearing a dark jacket. The camera captures the person centrally, emphasizing their presence while also showing the surrounding escalator and tiled walls. The setting suggests an indoor environment, likely a subway or shopping center, with fluorescent lighting reflecting off the surfaces.",
    "Motion": "A woman with shoulder-length, light-colored hair is seen from behind as she ascends an escalator. The escalator is enclosed by white tiled walls and has a metallic handrail on the left side. The lighting is bright, with overhead lights casting reflections on the walls. The woman remains stationary on the escalator throughout the sequence, with no significant changes in her posture or the environment.",
    "Scene": "The video depicts an indoor setting within a subway station, featuring an escalator leading upwards. The environment is characterized by tiled walls and a metallic ceiling, both reflecting the fluorescent lighting that casts a cool, sterile glow. The escalator, with its dark, moving steps, contrasts with the lighter surroundings. The scene is devoid of natural light, suggesting it takes place underground. The setting is clean and modern, with a sense of symmetry created by the parallel lines of the walls and ceiling. The overall atmosphere is quiet and functional, typical of a transit space.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
