  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot, featuring a male lion with a tan body and a prominent dark brown mane in the center of the frame, walking steadily from left to right across the middle ground of a vast, sunlit grassy plain, likely a savanna. The field extends from the foreground to the background, covered in short, green grass dotted with small, scattered white and brown patches. Clusters of low, green trees and bushes are visible in the middle ground and background, scattered across the frame, with rolling hills in the distant background along the top edge. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, employing deep focus. As the lion, which has a muscular build and a long tail with a dark tuft at the end, continues its left-to-right movement, remaining in the center of the frame and the middle ground, the camera initially pans right and zooms in on the lion, making it larger in the frame. Midway, the camera movement transitions to only trucking right to follow the lion. The camera movement is not smooth; there is a noticeable pause. The scene is captured from an objective point of view, observing the lion in its natural habitat.",

    "Camera": "The camera is at a level angle and employs deep focus. The camera tracks the lion, initially panning right and zooming in on it, which becomes larger in the frame. Midway, the camera movement transitions to only trucking right to follow the lion. The camera movement is not smooth; there is a noticeable pause.",
    "Subject": "A male lion with a tan body and a prominent dark brown mane walks from left to right across a green grassy field. The lion has a muscular build and a long tail with a dark tuft at the end.",
    "Motion": "A male lion walks steadily from left to right across a green grassy field.",
    "Scene": "The video shows a vast, sunlit grassy plain, likely a savanna, stretching towards a hazy horizon with rolling hills. The ground is covered in short, green grass, dotted with small, scattered white and brown patches. In the mid-ground and background, clusters of low, green trees and bushes are sparsely distributed. A male lion with a dark mane walks steadily from right to left across the open grassland. The scene is captured from an objective point of view, observing the lion in its natural habitat.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a wide shot, featuring a male lion in the center of the frame, walking from left to right across the middle ground of a vast grassy field that extends from the foreground to the background. Clusters of low trees and bushes are visible in the middle ground and background, scattered across the frame, with rolling hills in the distant background along the top edge. As the lion continues its left-to-right movement, remaining in the center of the frame and the middle ground, the camera zooms in on the lion, transitioning to a full shot while maintaining its position in the center of the frame and the middle ground. The camera is positioned at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
