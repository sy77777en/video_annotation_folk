  "merged_caption": "This video features a full shot of a smartphone positioned horizontally in the center of the frame, with its screen visible. In the foreground, a light-skinned left hand is positioned on the left side of the frame, partially obscuring the left edge of the phone. A light-skinned right hand enters from the right, holding a silver, pen-like metal tool with a pointed metal tip and a knurled grip. The tool moves horizontally across the phone's screen, initially from left to right over a white paper strip with handwritten numbers \"2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\" taped across the top portion of the screen. The right hand then moves the tool vertically from top to bottom across the strip, reverses direction to the right, and scratches horizontally across the app icons displayed below the strip, repeating this motion across different areas of the screen. In the middle ground, additional metal tools are located next to the phone. The tool labeled \"JerryRigEverything\" is at the top left of the frame, partially visible, while another silver, pointed tool lies to the right of the phone. The background is a plain white table, with a silver, flat, blade-like tool positioned at the top of the frame, slightly left of center. The camera is static, providing a bird's-eye view with a shallow depth of field, focusing on the background.",

    "Subject": "A light-skinned left hand is positioned at the left side of a smartphone, which is displaying a home screen with various app icons. A white paper strip with handwritten numbers is taped horizontally across the top portion of the phone's screen. A light-skinned right hand holds a silver, pen-like tool with a pointed metal tip and a knurled grip, using it to scratch or tap the surface of the phone screen, moving across the app icons. In the background, a silver, flat, blade-like tool with \"JerryRigEverything\" printed on it in black is visible at the top, and another silver, pointed tool with a knurled grip lies to the right of the phone.",
    "Motion": "A right hand holds a silver, pen-like tool with a pointed metal tip, repeatedly scratching the phone's screen. The tool first moves vertically from top to bottom across a white paper strip taped to the top of the screen, then reverses direction to the right before scratching horizontally across the app icons displayed below the strip, repeating this scratching motion across different areas of the screen.",
    "Scene": "An overhead POV shot, where the camera is positioned directly above the subject for a top-down perspective, shows a smartphone lying on a plain white surface. The phone's screen is illuminated, displaying a grid of colorful app icons. A narrow white strip of paper or tape is adhered horizontally across the top portion of the screen, bearing handwritten black numbers and symbols: \"2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\". Two hands are visible; the left hand is in the frame but not steadying the phone, while the right hand holds a silver, metallic, pen-like tool with a pointed tip, which is being moved across the phone's screen. In the background, above the phone, a silver, flat, rectangular tool with \"JerryRigEverything\" printed in black on a white label is partially visible. To the right of the phone, two other silver, metallic, pointed tools are present.",
    "Spatial": "This video features a full shot of a smartphone positioned horizontally in the center of the frame, with its screen visible. In the foreground, a light-skinned left hand is positioned on the left side of the frame, partially obscuring the left edge of the phone. A light-skinned right hand enters from the right, holding a silver, pen-like metal tool. This tool moves horizontally across the phone's screen, initially from left to right over a white paper strip with handwritten numbers taped across the top portion of the screen, then moves downwards to interact with the app icons below, before returning to the center. In the middle ground, additional metal tools are located next to the phone. The tool labeled \"JerryRigEverything\" is at the top left of the frame. The background is a plain white table, with a silver, flat, blade-like tool positioned at the top of the frame, slightly left of center, and another silver, pointed tool visible to the right of the phone."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
