  "merged_caption": "In a medium close-up shot, a man with light skin, short dark brown hair, and light stubble stands slightly left of center in the foreground, wearing a light blue denim jacket open over a white t-shirt. He looks directly at the camera with a neutral expression and blinks. The camera is positioned at the man's level, using a shallow depth of field to keep him in focus. Directly behind him, a chain-link fence topped with barbed wire spans the width of the frame in the middle ground. Through the diamond-patterned mesh of the fence, the out-of-focus shapes of a building and trees are visible in the background. The scene is set outdoors during the day on a dark, paved surface. Initially, the man is stationary, but near the end of the clip, his upper body begins to bob slightly, indicating he is starting to walk forward toward the camera. The camera movement includes a tilt upward while panning left, followed by a slight jitter downward to re-center on the man, and finishes with a subtle pan to the right, with some noticeable shakiness. Towards the end of the scene, he appears to start moving, possibly walking towards the camera.",

    "Camera": "This eye-level shot uses a shallow depth of field to keep the man in the foreground in focus. The camera movement includes a tilt upward while panning left, followed by a slight jitter downward to re-center on the man, and finishes with a subtle pan to the right, with some noticeable shakiness.",
    "Subject": "A man with light skin, short dark brown hair, and light stubble stands facing forward. He wears a light blue denim jacket open over a white t-shirt. He looks directly at the camera with a neutral expression and blinks. Towards the end of the scene, he appears to start moving, possibly walking towards the camera. In the background, an out-of-focus fence and building are visible.",
    "Motion": "A man stands still while facing the camera, blinks his eyes, and then slightly shifts as if preparing to walk forward.",
    "Scene": "An outdoor scene is set during the day, featuring a man in a denim jacket standing on a dark, paved surface. A tall, silver chain-link fence is positioned directly behind him, separating the foreground from the background. Through the diamond-patterned mesh of the fence, the out-of-focus shapes of a building and trees are visible.",
    "Spatial": "In a medium close-up shot, a man is positioned slightly left of center in the foreground. Directly behind him, a chain-link fence topped with barbed wire spans the width of the frame in the middle ground. A building and trees are visible in the background through the fence. The camera is positioned at the man's level. He is initially stationary, but near the end of the clip, his upper body begins to bob slightly, indicating he is starting to walk forward toward the camera."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
