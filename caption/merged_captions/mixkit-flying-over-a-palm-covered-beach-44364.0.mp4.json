  "merged_caption": "This is a scenery shot focusing on an expansive natural landscape. The video opens with an extreme wide shot from a drone aerial perspective, where a dense forest of green palm trees fills the bottom and extends from the foreground into the background. The camera, at an aerial level with a level angle, captures the landscape with deep focus and a large depth of field. In the background, rolling green hills are positioned across the top of the frame beneath a clear sky. The camera smoothly pans from right to left while moving forward, providing a sweeping view of the palm trees. As the camera progresses, the forest remains dense, and the background reveals distant hills under a clear sky. Gradually, the coastline starts to come into view on the left side of the frame, with the ocean waves becoming visible. The camera continues to move forward, fully revealing the coastline and the ocean, with the forest still extending from the foreground towards the background. The camera then slowly pans from right to left, gradually revealing a sandy beach and the ocean, which enter the frame from the left and occupy the middle ground. By the end of the movement, the coastline takes up the left portion of the frame, while the vast forest remains in the center and right, and the distant mountains consistently form the horizon in the background. A few small buildings are partially visible in the bottom left foreground, nestled among the trees. The overall atmosphere is serene and natural, highlighting the beauty of the tropical environment, with sunlight illuminating the vibrant greenery and the shimmering surface of the water, creating a sense of tranquility and grandeur.",

    "Camera": "The video features an aerial-level camera with a level angle, capturing a landscape with deep focus and a large depth of field. The camera smoothly pans from right to left while moving forward, providing a sweeping view of the palm trees and coastline.",
    "Subject": "This is a landscape scenery shot. The focus is on the expansive natural environment, highlighting the vastness of the forest, coastline, and mountains. The emphasis is on the atmosphere and scale, rather than any specific object, creating a sense of tranquility and grandeur.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with an aerial view of a dense forest of palm trees, with the camera moving forward steadily. As the camera progresses, the forest remains dense, and the background reveals distant hills under a clear sky. Gradually, the coastline starts to come into view on the left side of the frame, with the ocean waves becoming visible. The camera continues to move forward, fully revealing the coastline and the ocean, with the forest still extending from the foreground towards the background.",
    "Scene": "The video, filmed by a drone, captures an expansive outdoor setting during the day. It showcases a lush tropical landscape with dense clusters of tall, green palm trees stretching across the scene. In the background, rolling hills and distant mountains create a natural horizon. The coastline is visible, with gentle waves lapping against a sandy beach. The sky is clear, allowing sunlight to illuminate the vibrant greenery and the shimmering surface of the water. The overall atmosphere is serene and natural, highlighting the beauty of the tropical environment.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
