  "merged_caption": "The video uses a wide shot to capture a misty waterfront cityscape. The stone walkway curves along the bottom edge of the frame in the foreground, with the water occupying the center and extending horizontally across the middle ground. Wooden posts are positioned near the left and center-left edges of the frame, in the middle ground. Two people are present: both are located in the middle ground on the right side, facing the water. The historic buildings line the background, stretching from the left to the right edge, partially obscured by fog. The camera is positioned at approximately human eye level, parallel to the ground, providing a first-person perspective of the scene. This eye-level, level-angle shot exhibits mild barrel distortion, causing straight lines near the frame's edge to bow outward. The camera is also tilted at a Dutch angle that varies as it rolls. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp. The camera moves forward slightly while smoothly panning from left to right with minimal shaking. One person stands still near the water's edge while another walks along it, both gazing out over the water. The overall atmosphere is peaceful and serene. The water is a muted blue-green, with gentle ripples, bordered by a low, curved stone wall. Across the water, a row of multi-story historic buildings with pale facades and rectangular windows lines the opposite bank, partially obscured by a layer of mist or fog that softens the outlines and reduces visibility. The sky is overcast, contributing to the subdued lighting and cool atmosphere, suggesting early morning or late afternoon. A person in a long, checked coat stands near the water’s edge, facing away, while another person in dark clothing is positioned further along the promenade, both adding a sense of scale and context to the tranquil, misty setting.",

    "Subject": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot featuring a misty waterfront with historic buildings lining the opposite shore, their facades partially obscured by fog. The water, situated in the middle ground, is a deep blue-green, gently rippling and bordered by a stone walkway that curves along the edge. The atmosphere is tranquil and slightly mysterious due to the haze, emphasizing the scale and ambiance of the urban landscape rather than focusing on any individual person or object. There is no main subject because the intent is to capture the overall mood and expanse of the cityscape, highlighting the interplay between architecture, water, and weather.",
    "Motion": "This video captures a scenic waterfront view with calm water and historic buildings partially obscured by mist in the background. One person stands still near the water's edge while another walks along it, both gazing out over the water. The overall atmosphere is peaceful and serene.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, shows an outdoor waterfront scene along a stone-paved promenade beside a wide canal or lagoon. The water is a muted blue-green, with gentle ripples, bordered by a low, curved stone wall. Across the water, a row of multi-story historic buildings with pale facades and rectangular windows lines the opposite bank, partially obscured by a layer of mist or fog that softens the outlines and reduces visibility. The sky is overcast, contributing to the subdued lighting and cool atmosphere, suggesting early morning or late afternoon. Wooden posts rise from the water near the edge of the promenade, and a few boats are faintly visible in the distance. A person in a long, checked coat stands near the water’s edge, facing away, while another person in dark clothing is positioned further along the promenade, both adding a sense of scale and context to the tranquil, misty setting. No overlays or digital elements are present in the video.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
