  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot, a person on an orange and white dirt bike, wearing a white helmet with blue and red accents, a red and black long-sleeved top, gray and orange pants, and black boots, is initially positioned in the center-left of the frame, in the middle ground of a steep, grassy hill. The camera, from an eye-level, high-angle perspective, captures the scene with a deep focus, maintaining a large depth of field. A town with red-roofed houses is visible in the background at the top of the frame, while a dense thicket of green trees and bushes stretches from the foreground to the middle ground on the right. The rider accelerates up the steep, dusty trail, causing the front wheel of the bike to lift off the ground as they ascend the rocky, uneven terrain. As the rider moves toward the center and then to the right side of the frame, the slightly unsteady, handheld camera pans right and tilts up to follow their movement. This action causes the rider to move from a position below the camera to one above it, shifting the camera's relative height to be below the subject. During this transition, the town in the background moves out of the frame, which then shows the hillside in the foreground and middle ground, with a line of trees in the middle ground and the sky in the background. The outdoor scene unfolds on a steep, grassy hillside during the day, with the terrain covered in a mix of green and brown grass, scattered rocks, and small yellow wildflowers. The sky is overcast with some clouds, and as the rider ascends the hill, they kick up a trail of dust, adding to the dynamic movement captured by the camera.",

    "Camera": "From an eye-level, high-angle perspective, the slightly unsteady, handheld camera pans right and tilts up to follow a motorcyclist riding up a slope. This movement causes the camera angle to shift from high to low. The shot maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "A person is riding an orange and white dirt bike. The rider is wearing a white helmet with blue and red accents, a red and black long-sleeved top, gray and orange pants, and black boots.",
    "Motion": "A person on an orange and white dirt bike rides up a steep, dusty trail on a grassy hillside. As they accelerate, the front wheel of the bike lifts off the ground, and they continue to ascend the rocky, uneven terrain.",
    "Scene": "An outdoor scene unfolds on a steep, grassy hillside during the day. The terrain is rugged, covered in a mix of green and brown grass, scattered rocks, and small yellow wildflowers. Initially, a dense thicket of green trees and bushes lines the right side of the slope. In the first part of the video, a town with red-roofed houses is visible in a valley below, but it disappears from view as the camera pans. The sky is overcast with some clouds. A person on an orange and white dirt bike ascends the hill, kicking up a trail of dust as they move up the incline and across the landscape.",
    "Spatial": "In a wide shot, a person on a dirt bike is initially positioned in the center-left of the frame, in the middle ground of a steep, grassy hill, with the camera positioned above them.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
