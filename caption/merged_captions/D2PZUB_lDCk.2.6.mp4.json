  "merged_caption": "An abstract scene unfolds with a wavy surface of golden particles stretching across the frame, gently undulating at the bottom. A bright glow radiates from the bottom-center, sending thin, vertical lines of golden light upwards, each culminating in a bright, star-like point of light that also ascends. Smaller particles float throughout the scene, gently drifting and enhancing the ethereal atmosphere. The camera remains completely static throughout the video, allowing the viewer to focus on the continuous rise of the vertical streams of light and the gentle drift of the smaller golden specks. Against the dark, deep-gold background, this shimmering landscape of particles forms gentle, rolling waves, with numerous smaller, glowing specks of light interspersed between the rising lines. A bright, radiant glow emanates from the horizon where the wavy surface meets the dark background, creating a central point of illumination.",

    "Subject": "This abstract animation features a dark, deep-gold background filled with shimmering golden particles. At the bottom of the scene, a dense collection of these particles forms a wavy, fluid-like surface that glitters and shifts. From this surface, numerous thin, vertical lines of golden light rise upwards, each topped with a bright, star-like point of light. Smaller, floating golden specks are scattered throughout the entire space, drifting gently. A bright, horizontal glow emanates from the horizon line, creating a focal point of intense light where the wavy surface meets the dark background.",
    "Motion": "A wavy surface composed of dense golden particles gently undulates at the bottom of the frame. From this shifting surface, numerous thin, vertical streams of light continuously rise upwards, each culminating in a bright point of light that also ascends. Simultaneously, smaller, individual golden specks drift and float upwards throughout the space.",
    "Scene": "Against a dark background, a landscape of shimmering golden particles forms gentle, rolling waves at the bottom of the scene. Thin, vertical lines of golden light continuously rise from this glittering surface, ascending towards the top. Numerous smaller, glowing specks of light float and drift throughout the space, interspersed between the rising lines. A bright, radiant glow emanates from the horizon where the wavy surface meets the dark background, creating a central point of illumination.",
    "Spatial": "An abstract scene unfolds with a wavy surface of golden particles stretching across the frame.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
