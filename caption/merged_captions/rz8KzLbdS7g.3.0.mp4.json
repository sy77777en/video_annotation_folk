  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot from an eye-level perspective, capturing a serene residential street in Japan on a bright, sunny day. The shot begins with a modern two-story house occupying the left and center of the frame in the middle ground, featuring a grey upper floor and a white lower level with a wooden front door. A grey utility pole is prominent in the left foreground, with a small red box at its base, while an orange pole with a convex traffic mirror is in the right foreground. The slightly unsteady camera, in a first-person POV, moves forward down a residential alley, then pans slowly from right to left, revealing a harmonious blend of traditional and modern houses. This movement shifts the focus from the house to the adjacent street, where several cars are parked, including a black and a white van under a carport with a translucent, arched roof in the right middle ground. Directly across from the carport, three vehicles—a silver minivan, a black car, and a small white utility truck—are parked in the left foreground and middle ground. The camera continues walking forward along this new path, capturing everyday details like a prominent concrete utility pole, a red fire hydrant box, and a web of power lines crisscrossing the clear blue sky. A red and white transmission tower can be seen in the distance. The final frame settles on a view down the street, with the carport on the right and other vehicles parked along the narrow road, all set against the backdrop of a bright, sunny day with a clear blue sky. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp, emphasizing the tranquil atmosphere and the specific architectural character of the neighborhood.",

    "Camera": "This first-person POV video is captured from an eye-level, level angle. The slightly unsteady camera moves forward down a residential alley, then pans left to face another path. It continues walking forward along this new path before ending with a final, slight pan to the left. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a residential scenery shot of a quiet, sun-drenched street in a Japanese suburb. The scene is characterized by modern two-story houses with clean, geometric lines and a mix of grey and white siding, contrasted with older, more traditional homes in the background. Several vehicles, including a white minivan and a black minivan under a translucent carport. Along the road, there are three vehicles: a silver minivan, a black car, and a small white utility truck. The environment is punctuated by everyday details like a prominent concrete utility pole, a red fire hydrant box, a convex traffic mirror, and a web of power lines against a clear blue sky. There is no single main subject, as the camera's slow pan is intended to capture the overall tranquil atmosphere and the specific architectural character of the neighborhood, focusing on the environment itself rather than any particular object.",
    "Motion": "This video captures a serene residential street in Japan, showcasing a harmonious blend of traditional and modern houses. As the camera slowly pans to the left, it reveals a blend of traditional and modern houses and several cars parked in a carport and along the narrow road, all set against the backdrop of a bright, sunny day with a clear blue sky.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, pans slowly from right to left along a quiet residential street in Japan on a bright, sunny day. The scene is dominated by modern two-story houses, one of which has a grey upper floor and a white lower level with a wooden front door. A narrow paved road runs between the homes, where several cars are parked, including both a black and a white van under a carport with a translucent, arched roof. Directly across from the carport, three cars—a silver, black, and white—are parked. A prominent grey utility pole stands near a small red box on the ground, while an orange pole with a convex traffic mirror is visible on the right. Power lines crisscross the clear blue sky, and a red and white transmission tower can be seen in the distance.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
