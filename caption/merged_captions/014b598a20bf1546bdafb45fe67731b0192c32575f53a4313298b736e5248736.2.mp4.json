  "merged_caption": "The video features a full shot of the figure in the red-and-blue Spider-Man costume, with another figure in a Spider-Man Noir costume visible in the distance. Initially, the red-and-blue Spider-Man-costumed individual is crouching low to the ground in the foreground inside a gazebo with ornate metal railings and a wooden roof. The camera starts at hip level and moves to ground level, initially at a level angle, then shifts to a low angle, looking up, with a varying Dutch angle due to camera rolling. The camera maintains deep focus with a large depth of field and moves slowly downward while tilting up, focusing on the person in the Spider-Man costume. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking. As the video progresses, the camera movement shifts his position within the frame, rather than the individual moving towards the center. The person then performs a motion similar to bouncing up, with their arms extended horizontally to the sides, and gradually stands up. Once fully standing, the person adjusts their posture and appears to be preparing for further action. The Spider-Man Noir character is in the mid-ground, moving from right to left, not walking away from the gazebo. The ornate metalwork and wooden ceiling of the gazebo occupy the middle ground, framing the subjects. The surrounding urban landscape, including buildings and leafless trees, forms the backdrop. The red-and-blue Spider-Man-costumed individual's feet are mostly out of view, and the camera angle changes throughout the video, focusing on the transition from a crouched to a standing position. The video captures an outdoor setting in a public gazebo located in a city square during daylight, with overcast skies visible through the open structure. Other indistinct people are visible further in the background outside the structure.",

    "Camera": "The video is in slow motion, with the camera starting at hip level and moving to ground level. Initially, the camera is at a level angle, then shifts to a low angle, looking up. A varying Dutch angle is present due to camera rolling. The camera maintains deep focus with a large depth of field. It moves slowly downward while tilting up, focusing on the person in the Spider-Man costume. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video features two individuals dressed in Spider-Man costumes inside a gazebo. The main subject, positioned centrally, wears a red and blue Spider-Man suit with a textured web pattern, large reflective eye lenses on the mask, and black sneakers. This person starts in a low crouch and then rises to a standing position while gesturing with their hands. In the middle ground, another individual, dressed as Spider-Man Noir in a completely black Spider-Man-style costume with some white markings, walks towards the center of the frame. Other indistinct people are visible further in the background outside the structure.",
    "Motion": "In a gazebo-like structure with ornate metal railings and a wooden roof, a person in a Spider-Man costume is initially crouched down. The person then performs a motion similar to bouncing up, with their arms extended horizontally to the sides, and gradually stands up. Once fully standing, the person adjusts their posture and appears to be preparing for further action. Meanwhile, a person dressed in a Spider-Man Noir costume is walking from the right to the left. The background shows a park-like setting with trees, buildings, and a few people in the distance.",
    "Scene": "The video captures an outdoor setting in a public gazebo located in a city square. The time of day is during daylight, with overcast skies visible through the open structure. The gazebo features ornate metal railings and a wooden roof with a decorative pattern. Surrounding the gazebo, there are bare trees and multi-story buildings, indicating an urban environment. The scene includes a person in a distinctive costume, moving within the gazebo, with the cityscape providing a backdrop. The setting is calm, with no visible weather disturbances, and the architectural elements suggest a blend of traditional and urban styles.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
