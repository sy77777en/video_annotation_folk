  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot, where a silhouetted man is positioned in the middle ground at the far end of a dimly lit indoor corridor. The corridor walls are visible on the left and right, extending from the foreground to the background. A brighter rectangular opening, containing a partially visible sign with dark blue text that includes \"A330\" and a stylized logo, is located in the background, center, behind the man. The scene is shadowy, with the primary light source emanating from the end of the hallway. The man, visible as a dark silhouette against the brighter area, runs from this background area through the darker middleground corridor directly towards the camera. As he runs, his coat billows with his movement, and his lower legs are bare, suggesting he is wearing shorts or short trousers. His hair appears short. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, maintaining a level angle and employing deep focus to keep a large depth of field. It moves backward smoothly, leading the silhouetted figure who is running towards it from the brighter doorway. As the man runs towards the camera, he remains in the middle ground, appearing larger in the frame while staying in the center.",

    "Camera": "The camera is at eye level and maintains a level angle. It employs deep focus, keeping a large depth of field. The camera moves backward smoothly, leading a silhouetted figure who is running towards it from a brighter doorway.",
    "Subject": "A man, visible as a dark silhouette against a brighter area behind him, runs towards the viewer. He wears a coat that billows with his movement. His lower legs are bare, suggesting he is wearing shorts or short trousers, and his hair appears short.",
    "Motion": "A silhouetted man runs from a brighter background area, through a darker middleground corridor, directly towards the camera. As he runs, his long, open garment billows around him.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set in a dimly lit indoor corridor, with dark, plain walls on either side. At the far end of the corridor, a brighter, rectangular opening reveals a glimpse of an exterior or a well-lit room. Within this opening, a part of an airplane is partially visible, featuring dark blue text that includes \"A330\" and a stylized logo. A silhouetted figure, wearing a coat of normal length, is seen approaching the camera, moving away from the brighter area of the corridor. The overall atmosphere is dark and shadowy, with the primary light source emanating from the end of the hallway.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a full shot, where a silhouetted man is positioned in the middle ground at the far end of a dimly lit corridor.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
