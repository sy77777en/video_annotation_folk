  "merged_caption": "This is a medium shot of a group of police officers in a dark environment, within a dimly lit tunnel at night. In the foreground, an officer is positioned slightly right of center, framed from the chest up as he looks upward. He is a light-skinned man with short, dark hair, wearing a police cap and a dark blue uniform with a yellow stripe over the shoulder. On the left side of the frame, in the midground, another light-skinned officer with short, blond hair is visible from the hip up, looking toward the left of the frame, positioned to the right of the central officer. Next to him, another light-skinned man with short, blond hair looks forward. Other officers are positioned in the midground and background, with two individuals in black helmets and dark tactical gear visible on the far right. The officers are illuminated by bright, focused lights, with yellow lights mounted on the walls and additional, brighter lights visible in the background. The camera, from a high, eye-level angle, uses a shallow depth of field to focus on the police officers in the midground. It moves smoothly forward and from left to right with minimal shaking as the group of officers advances, maintaining their gaze forward and slightly upward, towards the left and above the camera, with some occasionally glancing behind them. Bright, unfocused lights are located in the top background. The camera moves forward as the group of officers gradually steps in a direction slightly to the left of the camera, maintaining eye-level positioning. The scene is dimly lit, punctuated by the bright, focused beams of several flashlights they are holding, which cast a harsh light on their surroundings.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
