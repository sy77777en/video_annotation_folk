  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide shot, maintaining this framing throughout with a slight, slow push-in towards the subject. Initially, a woman is positioned in the center of the frame, standing in the middle ground atop a wooden ramp. She has short, light-colored hair and is wearing a light-colored knit hat, tank top, and pants, suggesting a casual style. The ramp is in the bottom middle ground. Initially, a grated floor is visible in the bottom middle ground but then exits the frame. An out-of-focus green object dominates the right foreground initially, but later exits the frame. In the background, behind the woman and slightly to her left, several skateboards are mounted on the wall. Further left in the background, a neon sign reads 'BRING ON THE NIGHT.' The surrounding space in the middle ground and background contains various furniture and objects, contributing to a creative and urban atmosphere. A grated ceiling structure is visible at the top. The camera is positioned at eye level and begins with a level angle, looking straight ahead. It uses deep focus, maintaining clarity across the scene. The camera slightly pans right to center the skateboarder and then moves forward, subtly tilting upward while maintaining a level angle and focusing straight ahead. The movement is slightly unsteady, with some shaking. The space is illuminated by natural light streaming through large windows, casting shadows and creating a warm ambiance. The time of day appears to be late afternoon, as indicated by the angle and quality of the light. As the shot progresses, the camera moves slightly forward. Towards the end, a small drone flies into the frame from the top left, positioning itself close to the woman in the middle ground, prompting her to turn her head to her right to watch it.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
