  "merged_caption": "This is a full shot featuring two crocodiles near a riverbank. One crocodile is positioned horizontally across the middle ground on the sandy riverbank, extending from the center-left to the center-right of the frame, with its head near the water's edge. The crocodile gradually moves its front legs into the water, revealing its rough, textured skin with a mix of gray and green hues and distinct dark bands along its elongated, muscular body. The head and upper back of a second crocodile are visible in the center-right foreground, partially submerged in the murky water, with its snout above the surface. This crocodile remains floating, creating gentle ripples that spread across the water. The riverbank, with its light brown, muddy slope and sparse, dry-looking vegetation, occupies the upper portion of the frame in the middle ground and background, while the water fills the lower portion in the foreground. The camera is positioned above water at a level angle, focusing on the crocodile on the riverbank. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera remains completely static, with no movement or shaking, capturing the scene during daylight hours.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned above water at a level angle, focusing on a crocodile on the riverbank. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera remains completely static, with no movement or shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video features two crocodiles near a riverbank. The first crocodile is on a sandy riverbank, appearing to crawl toward the river, with its snout clearly visible. The second crocodile is floating on the water's surface, its swimming motion creating gentle ripples that spread across the water. Both the crocodiles have rough, textured skin with a mix of gray and green hues, and distinct dark bands along their tails. Their bodies are elongated and muscular, with visible scales.",
    "Motion": "A crocodile is seen on a sandy riverbank, gradually moving its front legs into the water. The second crocodile remains floating on the water's surface, with its body partially submerged and its head above the water. The background consists of a dry, sandy riverbank with some scattered vegetation.",
    "Scene": "The video captures an outdoor scene at the edge of a body of murky water. A light brown, muddy bank slopes down to meet the water, with sparse, dry-looking vegetation present. Two crocodiles are in the scene: the first crocodile is on the sandy riverbank, moving towards the water, while the second crocodile is partially submerged in the river, with only its upper half visible. The water's surface shows ripples caused by the movements of the submerged crocodile. The scene occurs during daylight hours.",
    "Spatial": "This is a full shot featuring two crocodiles. One crocodile is positioned horizontally across the middle ground on the riverbank, extending from the center-left to the center-right of the frame, with its head near the water's edge. The head and upper back of a second crocodile are visible in the center-right foreground, partially submerged in the water. The riverbank occupies the upper portion of the frame in the middle ground and background, while the water fills the lower portion in the foreground. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
