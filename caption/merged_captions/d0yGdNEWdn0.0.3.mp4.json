  "merged_caption": "A medium shot frames a middle-aged white man with short, dark brown hair, a receding hairline, and a full dark beard and mustache, from the waist up, positioning him slightly left of center in the foreground. He is wearing a white button-down shirt, dark trousers, and a dark belt, with a red lanyard and name tag around his neck, and a small microphone clipped to his shirt. He gestures with both hands as he talks, holding a small black presentation remote in his right hand. To his left, a large, blank projector screen occupies the right portion of the frame. A light-colored wooden cabinet is visible behind him, situated toward the left side of the frame. The background consists of a deep red wall, with several white electrical panels mounted on the far left. The lighting in the room is even and functional. The camera, from a slightly unsteady, eye-level perspective, maintains a deep focus on the speaker. It executes a minor pan from left to right, following his movements. As the man speaks, he moves his hands apart and then brings them together in front of his chest, before separating them again to continue gesturing. The camera slightly tilts up and down throughout the clip, enhancing the dynamic interaction between the speaker and the audience.",

    "Scene": "The scene takes place indoors in a presentation room with a deep red back wall. A man stands slightly to the left of the center, positioned in front of a light-colored wooden lectern or cabinet. To the right, a large, blank white projector screen is visible.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
