  "merged_caption": "A medium shot frames a stocky, muscular jaguar positioned in the center of the screen, with its body extending towards the left. The jaguar's golden-yellow coat, patterned with distinctive black rosettes and spots, is partially obscured by the surrounding green foliage in the middle ground, while its round head with small ears, prominent white whiskers, and striking golden-yellow eyes remains fully visible. More out-of-focus greenery fills the background, creating a dense, green jungle environment. The camera is positioned at the jaguar's eye level, employing a level-angle shot with a shallow depth of field that keeps the focus sharp on the jaguar in the foreground. Initially, the jaguar looks directly forward, its bright yellow eyes gazing ahead, before it slowly lowers its head, shifting its gaze downward and to its right. The camera is very smooth and moves slowly with only minor, subtle motion, capturing the gradual change in the jaguar's posture and gaze.",

    "Subject": "A stocky, muscular jaguar is seen in a close-up, its body partially framed by green foliage. The feline's coat is a golden-yellow hue, patterned with distinctive black rosettes and spots. It has a round head with small ears, prominent white whiskers, and striking golden-yellow eyes that gaze forward before the animal lowers its head slightly.",
    "Motion": "A jaguar stares directly forward before slowly lowering its head and shifting its gaze downward.",
    "Scene": "A jaguar is positioned in a dense, green jungle environment, with out-of-focus leaves and foliage filling the background. The animal's yellow coat, covered in black rosettes, is partially obscured by the surrounding vegetation. It has bright yellow eyes and prominent white whiskers. The jaguar looks forward before slowly lowering its head.",
    "Spatial": "A medium shot frames a jaguar positioned in the center of the screen, with its body extending towards the left. Green foliage is visible in the middle ground, partially obscuring the back of the animal, while the jaguar's head remains fully visible. More out-of-focus greenery fills the background. The camera is positioned at the jaguar's eye level. Initially, the jaguar looks directly forward, and then it slowly lowers its head, shifting its gaze downward and to its right."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
