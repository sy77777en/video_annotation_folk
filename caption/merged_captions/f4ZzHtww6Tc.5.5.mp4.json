  "merged_caption": "The video, captured with a fisheye lens from a level angle at the subject's height, begins with a full shot of a man skateboarding, positioned in the center-right foreground, riding along a light gray concrete sidewalk that occupies the bottom foreground and extends into the middle ground. The skateboarder, wearing a white tank top, black pants, white socks, black and white sneakers, a black knit beanie, and displaying tattoos on his left arm, moves forward on the sidewalk. To the left, a silver hatchback is parked in the left foreground/middle ground, with a street and other cars visible in the left middle ground. Buildings, including one with white exterior stairs, are in the right middle ground, while palm trees are scattered in the middle ground and background. As the skateboarder moves forward, initially towards the center of the frame, he then veers slightly right, approaching a low, gray concrete wall in the right middle ground. He ollies onto this wall, which is positioned in front of a modern, dark gray slatted building in the right middle ground, performs a brief slide, and then jumps down. The camera, positioned at ground level with a level angle, maintains a deep focus and a large depth of field, moving forward to tail-follow the skateboarder, who becomes smaller in the frame. It includes a minor pan to the right as the skateboarder performs the stunt, with the camera movement slightly unsteady and exhibiting some shaking. The scene unfolds in a sunlit urban setting, with tall palm trees set against a bright sky and more buildings visible in the urban background, creating a dynamic and vibrant atmosphere.",

    "Camera": "The video exhibits noticeable fisheye distortion. The camera is positioned at ground level with a level angle, maintaining a deep focus and a large depth of field. It moves forward to tail-follow the skateboarder, who becomes smaller in the frame, and includes a minor pan to the right as the skateboarder performs a stunt. The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.",
    "Subject": "A man is skateboarding. He is wearing a white tank top, black pants, white socks, and black and white sneakers. He also wears a black knit beanie and has visible tattoos on his left arm.",
    "Motion": "A man skateboards forward on a sidewalk, ollies onto a low, grey ledge, performs a brief slide, and then jumps down.",
    "Scene": "The video, captured from a level angle with a distinct fisheye lens effect causing peripheral distortion, unfolds in a sunlit urban setting. It follows movement along a light gray concrete sidewalk that runs parallel to a street where cars, including a silver hatchback, are parked. Adjacent to the sidewalk, there's a low, gray concrete wall or planter, and buildings with varied architecture: one features white exterior stairs and a light-colored facade, while another presents a modern, dark gray slatted facade with some greenery. Tall palm trees are interspersed throughout, set against a bright sky, with more buildings visible in the urban background.",
    "Spatial": "The video, captured with a fisheye lens from a level angle at the subject's height, begins with a full shot of a skateboarder positioned in the center-right foreground, riding along a light gray concrete sidewalk that occupies the bottom foreground and extends into the middle ground.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
