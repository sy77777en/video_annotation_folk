  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a full shot of a humanoid figure seated in the center foreground, clad in white and purple armor with large, pointed shoulder pads and a segmented, white covering over its legs. Its head is a tall, white, cylindrical column with a glowing green keyhole in the center instead of a face. The figure is seated in an office chair, holding a grey mug with the words \"WORLD'S BEST LORD\" printed on it, resting on a small saucer in its hands. To the left, a floor lamp stands in the foreground, while a small table is positioned in the center-right foreground. In the middle ground, large arched windows span the width of the scene, with hazy light in shades of teal, yellow, and red filtering through, revealing blurry exterior views. The room is dark and sparsely furnished, with the floor lamp casting a spotlight on the central area. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, moves forward toward the humanoid figure while simultaneously zooming out, transitioning the scene into a medium shot. As the camera moves, the figure lifts the mug from the saucer, raising it slightly. The figure remains seated throughout the clip. An overlay of white, serif text appears at the bottom center of the frame, displaying the title \"THE LORD OF DOORS.\"",

    "Camera": "This smooth, eye-level, level-angle shot moves forward toward the armored character while simultaneously zooming out. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "A humanoid figure is seated in an office chair, with the text \"THE LORD OF DOORS\" becoming visible as an overlay when the figure lifts a grey mug. The figure's most striking feature is its head, which is a tall, white, cylindrical column with a glowing green keyhole in the center instead of a face. It is clad in white and purple armor with large, pointed shoulder pads and a segmented, white covering over its legs. The mug, which has the words \"WORLD'S BEST LORD\" printed on it, is first seen resting on a small saucer in the figure's hands.",
    "Motion": "A humanoid figure is seated in an office chair. The figure then lifts a mug from a saucer held in its hands, raising it slightly, as the camera moves forward together with zooming out. The figure remains seated throughout the clip.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set within a dark, sparsely furnished room characterized by large, arched windows. Hazy light in shades of teal, yellow, and red filters through the windows, revealing blurry exterior views. The room contains a modern office chair, a small side table, and a floor lamp that casts a spotlight on the central area. As the scene progresses, text reading \"WORLD'S BEST LORD\" becomes visible on a mug held by a figure. An overlay of white, serif text appears at the bottom, displaying the title \"THE LORD OF DOORS.\"",

To the left, a floor lamp stands in the foreground, while a small table is positioned in the center-right foreground. In the middle ground, large arched windows span the width of the scene, with scenery visible behind them as the background. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, moves forward toward the humanoid figure while simultaneously zooming out, transitioning the scene into a medium shot.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
