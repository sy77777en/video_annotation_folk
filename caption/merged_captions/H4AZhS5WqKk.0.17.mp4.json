  "merged_caption": "In this wide shot, the scene is framed from a worm's eye-view, looking up between two tall buildings. A building on the left extends from the bottom to the top of the frame in the foreground and middle ground, while another building occupies the top right. In the background, the cloudy night sky fills the center and top of the frame, with moonlight visible through the thick clouds in the center-upper-right. A small, animated cat with grey fur and a grey tail, with its belly, hands, and feet being white, is located in the center-upper-right of the frame, in the middle ground, balancing on a thin wire that stretches across the two buildings. The cat holds a long, thin object resembling a slender rod to keep balance. Its inner ears are pink. The cat wobbles and slowly moves toward the left along the wire. The camera is positioned below the subject, using a deep focus to render the buildings and the figure on the wire in sharp detail. The camera executes a smooth, minor upward movement. The scene is set at night, with the dark, cloudy sky illuminated by a bright moon, which is partially obscured by clouds. Two thin steel wires are stretched high across the gap between the buildings. The building facades feature numerous windows, some of which are lit from inside. Small, light raindrops fall down through the air. The animated cat is visible on the wire against the moonlit sky.",

    "Camera": "This worm's-eye view shot looks directly up at the night sky between tall buildings. The camera uses a deep focus, rendering the buildings and the figure on the wire in sharp detail. The camera executes a smooth, minor upward movement.",
    "Subject": "An animated cat with grey fur and a grey tail, with its belly, hands, and feet being white, is seen from a worm's eye view, balancing on a thin wire stretched high between the buildings in the air. The cat holds a long, thin object resembling a slender rod to keep balance. Its inner ears are pink, and the scene unfolds against a cloudy night sky illuminated by a bright moon.",
    "Motion": "An animated cat, initially balancing on a high wire stretched between two buildings, wobbles and slowly moves toward the left.",
    "Scene": "From a worm's eye view looking up between two tall, multi-story buildings, the scene is set at night. The dark, cloudy sky is illuminated by a bright moon, which is partially obscured by clouds. Two thin steel wires are stretched high across the gap between the buildings. The building facades feature numerous windows, some of which are lit from inside. Small, light raindrops fall down through the air. An animated cat is visible on the wire against the moonlit sky.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
