  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a full shot of a gray sedan with a sleek, angular design, capturing the entire vehicle from a rear-right angle. The car, characterized by its reflective surface and distinctive rear window shape, is parked on a quiet, tree-lined urban street, occupying the central part of the frame. The setting includes brick buildings with roadside landscaping shrubs and a sidewalk, suggesting a residential area. The lighting indicates a clear day, casting soft shadows on the pavement. Inside the car, an individual wearing a light-colored hat and jacket is seated in the back seat, facing forward, with their arm resting on the window frame. In the front right seat, a person wearing a dark beanie is turning their head towards the back, seemingly engaged in conversation. The car's rear license plate reads 'KNC 761'. The camera is positioned at a slightly high angle, looking down at the rear right of the car, using a shallow depth of field to focus on the car in the foreground. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to a medium shot, focusing more closely on the car's right side. The camera moves forward and rightward while slightly panning left, keeping the car and its occupant as the primary focus, with some unsteady shaking. The person in the back seat becomes more prominent, while the background elements, such as the buildings and sidewalk, remain visible but are less detailed due to the closer framing. The environment conveys a sense of tranquility and order, with neatly maintained surroundings and a peaceful atmosphere. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective.",

    "Motion": "The video shows a gray sedan parked on a street with a license plate reading 'KNC 761'. The car's rear window reflects the surrounding environment, including trees and buildings. Inside the car, a person wearing a light-colored hat and a light-colored jacket is seated in the back seat, with their arm resting on the window frame. This person appears to be looking forward throughout the sequence. In the front right seat, another individual wearing a dark beanie is turning their head towards the back, seemingly engaged in conversation with the person in the back seat.",
    "Scene": "The video depicts an urban street scene during the day, featuring a quiet, tree-lined residential area. The setting includes brick buildings with roadside landscaping shrubs and a sidewalk. A notable visual element is a gray car with a sleek, angular design, parked on the street. The car's metallic surface reflects the surroundings, adding a dynamic texture to the scene. The street is calm, with minimal traffic, and the lighting suggests a clear day, casting soft shadows on the pavement. The environment conveys a sense of tranquility and order, with neatly maintained surroundings and a peaceful atmosphere.",
    "Spatial": "The video starts with a full shot of the gray sedan, capturing the entire vehicle from a rear-right angle. The car is positioned in the foreground, occupying the central part of the frame, while the urban street and buildings form the background. The person inside the car is visible through the rear window, situated towards the right side of the frame. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to a medium shot, focusing more closely on the car's right side. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective. In the medium shot, the car still dominates the frame, with the person in the back seat now more prominent, their arm resting on the window frame. The background elements, such as the buildings and sidewalk, remain visible but are less detailed due to the closer framing. The camera moves forward and rightward while slightly panning left, keeping the car and its occupant as the primary focus."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
