  "merged_caption": "A medium shot frames a young woman with long, dark brown hair tied back in a ponytail, wearing a dark gray, short-sleeved t-shirt, from the back, positioned slightly left of center in the middle ground of a dimly lit indoor hallway. The light-colored walls are cast in deep shadow, creating a dark atmosphere. To her right, in the middle ground, is a closed white door with a silver handle, with a framed picture hanging on the wall between her and the door. In the background on the left, another white door is visible at the end of the corridor. The scene is illuminated by a soft, ambient light source from off-camera, which highlights the woman's profile and the edges of the objects in the hall. The woman emerges from a partially open door, which quickly closes behind her. She takes small steps forward and turns to her right, shifting into a profile view as she looks toward the door on the right. After standing still for a moment, she turns to her left, preparing to walk away. The camera, positioned at the woman's level, uses a shallow depth of field, focusing on the woman in the midground. It smoothly pans left, briefly pans right as she turns to her right, and then resumes its leftward pan as she prepares to walk away.",

    "Scene": "A woman with her hair in a ponytail stands in a dimly lit indoor hallway. The light-colored walls are cast in deep shadow, creating a dark atmosphere. To the right is a closed white door with a silver handle. Further down the wall, a single, dark-framed picture hangs on the wall. Another white door is visible in the background at the end of the corridor.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
