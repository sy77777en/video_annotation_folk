  "merged_caption": "This is a close-up, high-angle shot of a golf scene on a manicured green lawn. In the foreground, parts of the lawn are visible. In the middle ground, a small white golf ball and a large pink water-filled balloon are positioned, with the lower legs of a light-skinned person wearing white athletic shoes softly blurred behind them. The person holds a golf driver with a black head, a green and yellow design, and a white shaft. The video uses a speed ramp effect, shifting between fast and slow motion. The shot is captured from a mostly stable camera positioned at ground level with a high angle, featuring a subtle, smooth shake that becomes slightly noticeable towards the end. A shallow depth of field keeps the focus on the golf club and balls in the midground. The golf club swings from the left across the center of the frame, striking the white golf ball first, which flies to the right, hitting the large pink water balloon. The balloon bursts immediately upon impact, creating a large splash of white, foamy liquid that erupts outwards. The small white golf ball is propelled forward and to the right through the splash, while the remnants of the pink balloon are pushed by the golf club and exit the frame to the right. In the background, a neatly trimmed flat lawn and a blurred fence are visible. The camera maintains a high angle throughout the action, with a very subtle shake at the end of the video.",

    "Subject": "The lower legs and feet of a light-skinned person wearing white athletic shoes are visible on a green lawn. The person is holding a golf driver with a black head, a green and yellow design, and a white shaft. On the grass in front of the person are two objects: a small, standard white golf ball and a much larger, smooth, bright pink ball. The golf club swings and strikes the large pink ball, which immediately bursts, creating a large splash of white, foamy liquid that erupts outwards. The small white golf ball is propelled through the large pink ball as it bursts from the impact.",
    "Motion": "A person swings a golf club towards the right side of the frame, striking a white golf ball on the grass. The golf ball flies to the right, hitting a large pink water balloon, which bursts immediately upon impact. After hitting the golf ball, the club continues its swing and also strikes the pink water balloon. The golf ball passes through the balloon and continues moving to the right side of the frame.",
    "Scene": "On a manicured green lawn, a golf club is positioned near a large, pink, water-filled balloon and a standard white golf ball. The club swings downward in slow motion, striking the pink balloon, which bursts and sends a large splash of clear water across the grass. In the middleground, the lower legs of a person wearing white sneakers are visible, providing visual balance, with a blurred fence in the distance.",
    "Spatial": "This is a close-up, high-angle shot of a golf scene on a green lawn. In the foreground, parts of the lawn are visible. In the middle ground, a small white golf ball and a large pink water-filled balloon are positioned, with the lower legs of a person wearing white shoes softly blurred behind them. The person holds a golf driver, which swings from the left across the center of the frame, striking the golf ball first, then the pink balloon. Upon impact with the balloon, it bursts, and a large splash of white liquid erupts outwards. The small white golf ball is propelled forward and to the right through the splash, while the remnants of the pink balloon are pushed by the golf club and exit the frame to the right.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
