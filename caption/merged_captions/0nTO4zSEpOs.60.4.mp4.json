  "merged_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a bustling urban scene at night, capturing a spacious, tiled pedestrian walkway that occupies the lower half of the frame. Several people, dressed in dark, formal clothing and wearing face masks, are dispersed across the walkway, moving in various directions, with some carrying bags. The individuals are distributed across the left, center, and right of the frame, occupying the foreground and middle ground. Tall, illuminated buildings with prominent signage, including one displaying the \"GMO\" logo, dominate the background. The city lights illuminate the area, reflecting off the glass and metal surfaces, creating a vibrant atmosphere. The video begins with the camera at eye level, looking straight ahead. It smoothly pans right, maintaining a deep focus with a large depth of field, capturing the people and buildings in the night cityscape. As the camera pans, the GMO building shifts from the center to the left, maintaining the wide shot while including more of the illuminated skyscrapers and digital billboards. The camera then tilts up to a low angle, emphasizing the towering buildings, with minimal shaking throughout the motion. The environment is characterized by a well-lit area with modern architecture, and the weather is clear, allowing for an unobstructed view of the illuminated skyscrapers and digital billboards. Overlay elements include text in the bottom left corner, indicating \"Virtual Japan TV,\" which is not part of the physical scene. The overall composition highlights the vibrant city atmosphere, with the bustling pedestrian activity and the dynamic camera movements enhancing the sense of a typical evening in a busy city area.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
