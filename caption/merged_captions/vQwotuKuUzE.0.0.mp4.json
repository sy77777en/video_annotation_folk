  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a man in the right foreground, shown in profile against a backlit overpass in the background. He is wearing a black t-shirt under a black bulletproof vest with the word \"POLICE\" in large white letters across the chest, and he has short hair, a goatee, and a black choker-style collar. The scene takes place outdoors in a moderately lit area beneath two large, dark concrete overpasses, characterized by their prominent horizontal beams. A bright, white light source from the background illuminates the edge of the structures, creating a strong backlight. As the camera, in a slow-motion, low-angle shot, smoothly arcs counterclockwise around the man, it pans up to reveal his entire face as he listens to a device with a clear, coiled earpiece. A second man, also wearing a similar police vest and with short, styled hair, enters the frame from the bottom right, looking toward the first man with a concerned expression. The shot transitions to a medium close-up, with the first man positioned in the center-left foreground and the second man in the foreground on the center-right. The overpass structure remains in the background, and the camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the officers in the foreground in sharp focus. The second man stands behind the first, maintaining his concerned expression as he looks at him.",

    "Subject": "Two Black men are shown wearing black t-shirts under black bulletproof vests with the word \"POLICE\" in large white letters across the chest. Both men have short hair and goatees, and they are wearing black choker-style collars. The first man, seen in profile, has a serious expression as he listens to a device with a clear, coiled earpiece. The second man, who also has short, styled hair, stands behind the first with a concerned expression.",
    "Motion": "The camera pans up to reveal a man in a police vest holding a phone to his ear. A second man in a similar vest then appears behind him, looking toward the first man with a concerned expression.",
    "Scene": "The scene takes place outdoors in a moderately lit area beneath two large, dark concrete overpasses, characterized by their prominent horizontal beams. A bright, white light source from the background illuminates the edge of the structures, creating a strong backlight. Both men in the foreground are wearing black vests with the word \"POLICE\" printed in large, white capital letters. One man is initially seen in profile using a communication earpiece while the second man enters the shot, looking at him with a concerned expression.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
