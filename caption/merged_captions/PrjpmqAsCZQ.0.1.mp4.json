  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a man with a medium build, wearing a stylish bandana and a jacket over a shirt with a visible graphic or text, standing in the center of the frame and in the foreground. The setting is indoors, likely in a dimly lit room with a night vision effect, giving everything a green tint. In the background, a computer monitor is positioned with speakers located to the left and right of it, and to the man's right, a microphone stand is visible. The camera, handheld and positioned at hip level, captures the man from a low angle with a slight, unsteady Dutch angle due to camera rolling. The camera exhibits a shaky, erratic tilting up and down as it attempts to focus on the man. Initially, the man faces sideways, then turns to face forward, raising his hand to his face and making a gesture. He then turns to face the camera, raising his hand and pointing upwards with his index finger, subsequently pointing to his head as he listens to music and makes a cool gesture. The shot transitions to a medium close-up as the man moves closer to the camera, remaining in the center of the frame. In this closer view, he turns from a slight profile to face the camera directly, gesturing with his hands. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout the scene. The setting includes electronic equipment, such as speakers and a monitor, suggesting a studio or control room environment. The walls are dark, and the lighting is minimal, creating a shadowy atmosphere. A person is present, moving within the space, smoking. The overall scene is characterized by its low-light conditions and the presence of technology, with the person adding a dynamic element to the otherwise static environment.",

    "Camera": "The video features a handheld camera positioned at hip level, capturing a man from a low angle with a slight, unsteady Dutch angle due to camera rolling. The camera exhibits a shaky, erratic tilting up and down as it attempts to focus on the man. The focus is likely deep, though the low resolution makes it difficult to confirm.",
    "Subject": "The video features a man with a medium build wearing a stylish bandana and a jacket over a shirt with a visible graphic or text. In one part of the video, he is standing and facing sideways, while in another, he faces forward, gesturing with his hand near his head. The setting appears to be dimly lit with a greenish tint, suggesting the use of night vision or low-light conditions.",
    "Motion": "The man, standing in a dimly lit environment with greenish lighting, initially faces sideways and then turns to face forward. He raises his hand to his face, making a gesture. He then turns to face the camera, raising his hand and pointing upwards with his index finger. Subsequently, he points to his head with his finger, as he is listening to music and making a cool gesture.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
