  "merged_caption": "The video presents a full shot, maintaining a static frame throughout, with the camera fixed but slightly unsteady. In the center middle ground, a dark-haired man is seated sideways to the camera, his head lowered as he attends to his right foot, which is resting on his left knee. Suddenly, his head transforms into a cartoonish, green reptilian creature with an exaggeratedly wide-open mouth, sharp teeth, and a long, dark, curling tongue. The creature's mouth remains open wide, displaying its teeth and tongue, while its head is tilted slightly to the side. The creature has large, yellow eyes with black pupils, several light-colored horns or spikes adorning its head and jawline, and long, light-colored claws on its hands, which are positioned in front of its chest. To its left in the middle ground, a person in a light blue hooded sweatshirt stands with hands in pockets, with a woman in a light pink top and a darker pink or purple skirt to their right. Further right, a person in a yellow shirt and dark pants holds a folded white paper—possibly a newspaper. To the creature's right in the middle ground, a partially visible person wears a red and dark horizontally striped top and green pants. The immediate right foreground shows the back and shoulder of another individual, clad in a dark jacket with a light blue hood or collar detail. Indistinct figures and rows of seats occupy the background, suggesting an animated indoor scene, likely a subway car or train, from an objective point of view. The transformation reverts back to the man's original state, with him resuming his seated position and focus on his foot. The overall art style is cartoonish, with bold outlines and a somewhat muted color palette.",

    "Subject": "The video begins with a dark-haired man seated sideways to the camera, his head lowered as he attends to his right foot, which is resting on his left knee. As the scene progresses, he transforms into a cartoonish, green reptilian creature characterized by an atypically distorted and extremely wide-open mouth that stretches unnaturally. Inside its mouth are numerous sharp, white teeth and a long, dark, curling tongue. The creature has large, yellow eyes with black pupils, several light-colored horns or spikes adorning its head and jawline, and long, light-colored claws on its hands, which are positioned in front of its chest. To the left of this creature, a person is depicted wearing a light blue hooded sweatshirt, dark pants, and white shoes, standing with hands in pockets. Beside them, a woman with short, dark hair is shown in a light pink top and a darker pink or purple skirt. On the woman’s right stands a person wearing a yellow shirt and dark pants, holding a folded white paper—possibly a newspaper. To the creature's right, a portion of another person is visible, wearing a red and dark horizontally striped top and green pants. In the immediate right foreground, the back and shoulder of a fifth individual are seen, clad in a dark jacket with a light blue hood or collar detail.",
    "Motion": "A man is sitting on a bench, focused on his foot, which is resting on his knee. Suddenly, his head transforms into a cartoonish, green reptilian creature with an exaggeratedly wide-open mouth, sharp teeth, and a long tongue. The creature's mouth remains open wide, displaying its teeth and tongue, while its head is tilted slightly to the side. The transformation reverts back to the man's original state, with him resuming his seated position and focus on his foot.",
    "Scene": "The video depicts an animated indoor scene, likely a subway car or train, from an objective point of view. The setting features a single row of seats, with several indistinct figures of passengers visible in the background. A prominent figure, initially appearing as a very thin person wearing yellow-brown clothing, transforms into a green, monstrous creature with large, sharp teeth, a long tongue, and spiky protrusions, before reverting back to human form. The overall art style is cartoonish, with bold outlines and a somewhat muted color palette.",
    "Spatial": "The video presents a full shot, maintaining a static frame throughout. In the center middle ground, a green reptilian creature that has transformed from a human is seated. To its left in the middle ground, a person in a light blue hooded sweatshirt stands, with a woman in a light pink top to their right, and further right, a person in a light gray shirt holding a paper. To the creature's right in the middle ground, a partially visible person wears a red and dark striped top. The immediate right foreground shows the back and shoulder of another individual. Indistinct figures and rows of seats occupy the background. The camera is positioned at approximately eye level with the subjects."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
