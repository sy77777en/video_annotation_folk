  "merged_caption": "The right half of the frame is dominated by a close-up of a light pink sports car in the foreground, with its front passenger wheel spinning rapidly in the center-right. The vehicle's body extends to the top and right edges of the frame, featuring a dark gray, multi-spoke wheel with a silver rim and a small, black, textured carbon fiber piece attached to the fender just behind the wheel. On the left, a flat, dark ground surface stretches across the foreground, middle ground, and background, leading to a distant, hazy mountain range at the horizon under a clear, bright blue sky during the daytime. The clear sky fills the top left portion of the frame. The camera is positioned at a level angle, moving in unison with the vehicle to keep the car static in the frame while the scenery rushes past from left to right. A slightly unsteady, ground-level camera at a level angle moves backward and pans left quickly, leading a car from the front. The shot maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field. The perspective is a level, close-up view of the front passenger-side wheel, which spins rapidly, causing its spokes to blur. A locked-on POV shot, mounted near the front wheel of a car, captures the vehicle speeding across a vast, flat expanse. The ground is a dark, barren surface, possibly a dry lakebed or runway, stretching towards a distant, hazy mountain range. The car's body is a light pink color, with a black carbon fiber accent visible on the rear quarter panel. The multi-spoke wheel, featuring a dark finish and a light-colored outer lip, spins rapidly, creating motion blur against the fast-moving ground.",

    "Subject": "A level, close-up view captures the front passenger side of a light pink sports car as it moves. The car's dark gray, multi-spoke wheel, which has a silver rim, is shown spinning rapidly. A small, black, textured carbon fiber piece is attached to the fender just behind the wheel. Further back, the side of the car is gray with white, green, yellow, and blue decals visible.",
    "Motion": "A sports car travels forward at a high speed across a flat, dark landscape. The perspective is a level, close-up view of the front passenger-side wheel, which spins rapidly, causing its spokes to blur.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
