  "merged_caption": "From a low-angle perspective, the video opens with a full shot of a large, glossy, translucent mask-like sculpture resembling a human face with exaggerated features, including deep eye sockets, a prominent nose, and a wide, open mouth. The sculpture is positioned upright in the center of the foreground, partially submerged in a reflective liquid, with its lower portion dipping below the surface. The mask's orientation is frontal, facing directly forward, and its size dominates the scene, making it the central focus of the video. The surface of the mask is smooth and reflective, with subtle speckles and imperfections visible throughout. The video is captured above water, with mild barrel distortion causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward. The camera uses deep focus, keeping both the mask and the background elements sharp. As the camera moves smoothly backward, the sculpture shifts to the center of the middle ground. In the background, two brightly lit square windows with white frames are symmetrically placed in the top left and top right corners against a dark brick wall, emitting a bright, white light. The shot then transitions to a wider view, causing the central sculpture to become smaller within the frame and revealing more of the surrounding dark space and the reflective surface at the bottom. The mask-like sculpture remains stationary throughout the video, with no visible movement or change in position. The scene is set in a dark room with black brick walls, and the glossy, pale green sculpture has a marbled texture, empty eye sockets, and a wide-open mouth.",

    "Scene": "In a dark room with black brick walls, a large, translucent sculpture of a face is seen from a low-angle perspective. The glossy, pale green sculpture, which resembles a mask, has a marbled texture, empty eye sockets, and a wide-open mouth. Symmetrically positioned on the wall behind the sculpture are two square windows with white frames, both emitting a bright, white light.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
