  "merged_caption": "A medium shot captures a bright green spider with vibrant, translucent yellow-green legs covered in distinct black bristles or spines, positioned above a dark, textured surface in the lower right corner of the frame. The spider's head, or cephalothorax, features a prominent reddish-brown patch where multiple small, black, shiny eyes are clearly visible, arranged in a distinct pattern. The posterior half of its body has a fuzzy, yellowish texture, while the rest of its body segments are green. The spider occupies nearly the center and upper right areas, with its head in the middle right midground. Its green legs extend to the upper right and lower center left of the frame. The left side of the frame is mostly filled with a dark, out-of-focus background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, capturing a static, slightly unsteady macro shot with an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing sharply on the spider's face in the midground. The green spider remains completely motionless in this medium shot.",

    "Motion": "The green spider remains completely motionless in this medium shot.",
    "Scene": "A medium shot focuses on a spider against a dark, out-of-focus background. The spider has a reddish-brown head with several small, black, glossy eyes. Its body and legs are a translucent, vibrant lime green and are covered in prominent black, spiky hairs. The spider is positioned on a dark brown, textured surface, with two shorter front legs curled near its head.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
