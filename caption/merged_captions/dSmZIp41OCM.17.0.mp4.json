  "merged_caption": "This wide shot, filmed from a high angle above the subject, initially frames a small, hooded character with an atypical appearance, wearing a gray-blue hooded cloak and having a round, orange face with circular eyes and a line-like mouth, in the center of the screen and in the middle ground. A log cabin occupies the background, with a stone path leading from its central door toward the foreground. The single-story wooden house has a warm, reddish light glowing from its open door and windows. A white picket fence is visible in the background on the left and right sides of the cabin. As the character exits the wooden house with a red-lit interior through an open door, he steps down from the door's threshold and begins walking along the stone path. The character continues walking away from the house, moving towards the left side of the frame. As the character begins to move left, he remains centered in the frame because the camera follows his movement. A small garden plot becomes visible in the bottom right after the character starts moving. The background includes a wooden fence, plants, and a bench, indicating a garden or yard setting. Throughout the shot, UI elements are positioned at the bottom of the screen: a coin icon with the number 160 in the bottom left, an inventory bar in the bottom center, and two vertical status bars in the bottom right, one of which is partially filled with a blue liquid. The camera moves backward and briefly moves to the left during the clip, ensuring both the character and the environment are clear. The setting includes a path made of flat, round stones leading from the door across a grassy yard, which is partially enclosed by a white picket fence and contains small, tilled garden plots.",

    "Camera": "From a high, overhead angle, the camera smoothly tracks a cartoon character walking through a yard. The camera moves backward throughout the shot, with a brief leftward movement midway. The entire scene is kept in deep focus, ensuring both the character and the environment are clear.",
    "Subject": "The video features a character with an atypical appearance, wearing a gray-blue hooded cloak and having a round, orange face with circular eyes and a line-like mouth. The character is walking along a path made of stones. The setting includes a wooden house with visible windows and a door, and a fenced area with plants. The character's movement suggests a journey or exploration within this environment.",

    "Scene": "A 2.5D game video shows a scene set at dusk in the yard of a log cabin, rendered in a stylized, cartoonish art style with thick black outlines. The single-story wooden house has a warm, reddish light glowing from its open door and windows. A path made of flat, round stones leads from the door across a grassy yard, which is partially enclosed by a white picket fence and contains small, tilled garden plots. A small, hooded character with a smiling face walks from the front of the house toward the left side of the screen. On-screen overlays include a coin icon with the number 160 in the bottom-left corner, an inventory bar at the bottom center, and two vertical status bars in the bottom-right corner, one of which is partially filled with a blue liquid.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
