  "merged_caption": "The video presents a medium full shot of five light-skinned men standing in a horizontal line in the middle ground, against a white background wall marked with black horizontal lines and height measurements in feet and inches, ranging from 3'0\" to 6'6\". The scene is set indoors, in what appears to be a police lineup room with even and bright lighting. The camera is fixed at eye level and maintains a level angle, using deep focus with a large depth of field, and is slightly unsteady but has no intentional movement. From left to right: the first man, with dark receding hair and a short dark beard, wears a grey bomber jacket with \"PORSCHE\" hanging down the front over a dark top and brown trousers, looking slightly to his right with hands clasped. The second man, with short light brown hair and a beard, wears a long black leather coat over a black turtleneck, looking forward with his hands hanging naturally at his sides. The man in the center, with short dark hair and clean-shaven, wears a black suit jacket over an open bright red shirt and black trousers, holding a small yellow paper and gesturing as he speaks. He then hands the yellow paper to the fourth man, positioned to his left, who has short dark wavy hair, is clean-shaven, and wears a light blue collared shirt with a loosened patterned tie and light beige trousers, holding a beige jacket over his arm. This man reads from the paper and subsequently passes it to the fifth man on the far right, who has a high hairline with dark hair on the sides, is clean-shaven, and wears a light pink patterned shirt under a blue denim vest and dark grey trousers. The fifth man, initially looking forward, then looks down at the paper.",

    "Subject": "Five light-skinned men stand in a police lineup. The man on the far left has dark, receding hair, a short dark beard, and wears a grey bomber jacket with \"PORSCHE\" hanging down the front over a dark top and brown trousers, looking slightly to his right with hands clasped. Next to him, a man with short light brown hair and a beard wears a long black leather coat over a black turtleneck, looking forward with his hands hanging naturally at his sides. The man in the center has short dark hair and is clean-shaven; he wears a black suit jacket over an open bright red shirt and black trousers, holding a small yellow paper and gesturing as he speaks. To his right, a man with short dark wavy hair, clean-shaven, wears a light blue collared shirt with a loosened patterned tie and light beige trousers, holding a beige jacket over his arm and looking at a yellow paper in his hand, his other hand near his face. The man on the far right has a high hairline with dark hair on the sides, is clean-shaven, and wears a light pink patterned shirt under a blue denim vest and dark grey trousers. He first looks forward, then looks down as the yellow paper is handed to him. After the man in the center finishes speaking, he hands the yellow paper to the man on his right, who is holding a beige jacket. This man reads the note aloud and then passes it to the man on the far right.",
    "Motion": "Five men are standing in a police lineup in front of a height measurement backdrop. The man in the center, wearing a black suit with a red shirt, gestures with his hand and speaks while holding a yellow paper. He then hands the yellow paper to the man on his left, who first covers his mouth and laughs, then reads the note before handing it to the man on the far right. The man on the far right, wearing a blue vest over a patterned shirt, is looking down first, and then looking at the paper.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set indoors, in what appears to be a police lineup room. The background is a plain white wall marked with horizontal black lines and black height measurements in feet and inches, ranging from 3'0\" to 6'6\". There is no discernible furniture or other props in the immediate vicinity, creating a stark and functional environment. The lighting is even and bright, typical of an indoor setting. The subjects stand relatively still, with some minor shifts in posture and gestures.",
    "Spatial": "The video presents a medium full shot of five men standing in a horizontal line in the middle ground, against a white background wall marked with black horizontal lines and height measurements. From left to right: the first man is positioned on the left side of the frame, looking slightly to his left. The second man stands to his right, looking forward with his hands hanging naturally at his sides. The man in the center holds a small yellow paper, gestures while speaking, and then hands the paper to the fourth man, positioned to his left. This fourth man, holding a beige jacket over his arm, reads from the paper and subsequently passes it to the fifth man on the far right of the frame. The fifth man, initially looking forward, then looks down at the paper. The camera remains static and is positioned at the subjects' level throughout the scene."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
