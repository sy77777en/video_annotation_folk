  "merged_caption": "This wide shot presents an animated character with long pink hair and atypical anatomy in the foreground, positioned on the left side of the frame. The character is dressed in dark-colored clothing and is seated on the edge of a large, purple cliff that occupies the bottom left, with arms wrapped around its knees in a relaxed posture. The character faces away from the camera, gazing out over a vast landscape at a vibrant, cloud-filled sky with a setting sun. The camera performs a small, slow, smooth upward movement and then remains still, maintaining a deep depth of field. In the middle ground, a vast expanse of pink and purple clouds stretches across the lower half of the scene, from the center to the right, with a cloud in the lower left foreground gently moving. The character's hair is gently blowing in the wind, and the sky is filled with small, glowing particles that flicker alternately. The background is composed of a deep purple, starry sky filling the top portion of the frame, with white and pink stars and faint beams of light shining down. Near the sunset, the sky is bright and colorful, casting a warm glow on the clouds, and then transitions to a darker, starry sky above. A bright, glowing orb is visible in the bottom right, far in the distance among the clouds, with small patches of green land peeking through the cloud cover. The camera is positioned at a height similar to the character, capturing the view from behind them, and the scene conveys a sense of contemplation or observation.",

    "Scene": "In an animated outdoor scene set at twilight, a figure with long magenta hair sits on the edge of a large, purple cliff, gazing out over a vast landscape. The deep purple sky above is filled with white and pink stars, and faint beams of light shine down. Below, a sea of pink and purple clouds stretches towards the horizon, where a bright, glowing orb is visible. Small patches of green land can be seen peeking through the cloud cover.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
