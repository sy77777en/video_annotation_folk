  "merged_caption": "From a first-person perspective at eye level, a black, boxy firearm occupies the foreground at the bottom center and right of the frame. Initially, a dark, possibly metal wall with the white stenciled text \"7208-JITE\" is positioned in the middle ground on the left, with a two-story, predominantly white concrete building in the background on the right and green, leafy trees, including palms, in the middle ground between them. The ground is dusty and scattered with rubble. A heads-up display (HUD) is overlaid, featuring a mini-map with blue and green icons in the bottom left corner, status indicators in blue boxes at the bottom right corner, including an ammunition count of \"87 / 101\" and player information, and orange, diamond-shaped markers near the center. Blue text at the center of the frame displays the number of enemies eliminated. The camera, positioned at an eye-level, level angle, maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The movement is quick and slightly unsteady with some shaking, characterized by intermittent fast pans to the left while moving slightly forward to simulate a player's view. As the camera moves to the left, the dark wall shifts to the right side of the frame and eventually moves off-screen. Simultaneously, a person in military-style camouflage lying on their back comes into view, settling in the bottom left quadrant in the middle ground. As the view moves, orange diamond-shaped markers on the graphical overlay shift across the screen, seemingly tracking specific objects in the video. The person in a first-person perspective retracts the gun and starts running. The sunlit, outdoor urban area is next to a multi-story building with gray on the lower half of the first-floor walls, and instead of large open windows, corridors are visible.",

    "Camera": "This video is presented from the first-person perspective of a video game. The camera is positioned at an eye-level, level angle and maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The movement is quick and slightly unsteady with some shaking, characterized by intermittent fast pans to the left while moving slightly forward to simulate a player's view.",
    "Subject": "From a first-person viewpoint, a black, boxy firearm is held, pointing forward. As the camera pans to the left, a person in military-style camouflage becomes visible, lying on their back. A graphical overlay is present, featuring a small, square map with blue and green icons in the lower-left corner, accompanied by several lines of green text nearby. In the lower-right corner, a display shows blue bars and white numbers, including \"87 / 101\". Blue text at the center of the frame displays the number of enemies eliminated. Orange, diamond-shaped markers with numbers move across the screen as the camera shifts, seemingly tracking specific objects in the video.",
    "Motion": "From a first-person perspective, the view pans to the left and moves slightly forward, revealing a figure in camouflage lying on the ground. As the view moves, orange diamond-shaped markers on the graphical overlay shift across the screen, while the person in a first-person perspective retracts a gun and starts running.",
    "Scene": "From a first-person POV, as if through the character’s eyes, the scene is set in a sunlit, outdoor urban area next to a multi-story, predominantly white concrete building with gray on the lower half of the first-floor walls. Instead of large open windows, corridors are visible. The ground is dusty and scattered with rubble, where a figure in combat attire lies. In the background, green, leafy trees, including palms, stand under a bright sky. To the right is a dark, possibly metal, wall with the white stenciled text \"7208-JITE.\" A video game heads-up display (HUD) is overlaid on the scene, featuring a mini-map in the lower left corner, orange diamond-shaped icons near the center, and various status indicators in blue boxes at the lower right corner, including ammunition count and player information. A black firearm is visible in the lower portion of the view.",
    "Spatial": "From a first-person perspective at eye level, a firearm occupies the foreground at the bottom center and right of the frame. Initially, a dark wall is positioned in the middle ground on the left, with a two-story building in the background on the right and trees in the middle ground between them. A heads-up display is overlaid, with a mini-map in the bottom left, status indicators in the bottom right, and orange diamond-shaped markers near the center. The camera moves to the left, and  the dark wall to shift to the right side of the frame and eventually move off-screen. Simultaneously, a person lying on the ground comes into view, settling in the bottom left quadrant in the middle ground, while the orange markers shift across the screen in correspondence with the camera's movement."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
