  "merged_caption": "The video presents a full shot of a person dressed in a white outfit with orange stripes, including a hood with a mask, gloves, and shoes. The individual, who has a light skin tone, is positioned centrally within the frame, walking to the right and then to the left. This movement occurs in the foreground, while the background remains static, featuring a large black backdrop with a silver control panel on the left side. The control panel is situated in the middle ground to the left and includes switches and a knob. Above the scene, a white line structure spans horizontally across the top, adding depth to the background. The camera maintains a steady position at the subject's level throughout the sequence, capturing the person's full body as they move across the frame. The person walks from the center of the frame to the right, gradually turning their body to face the camera. The background is black, and there is a control panel with three switches and a dial on the left side of the frame. The person turns to eventually face the camera directly, and then walks from the right to the center of the frame at the end. The camera is at eye level with a level angle, using deep focus for a large depth of field. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement. The indoor setting has a minimalist, futuristic design, with a sleek and modern atmosphere focusing on geometric shapes and a monochromatic color scheme. The environment is well-lit, emphasizing the contrast between the black and white elements. The attire suggests a uniform or costume, possibly for a specific role or activity, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise static environment.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
