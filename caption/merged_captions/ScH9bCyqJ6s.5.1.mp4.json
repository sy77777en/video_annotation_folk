  "merged_caption": "In an extreme close-up, overhead shot, a blue smartphone circuit board is held in the center of the frame by two hands, positioned near the corners of the frame. The person has light-colored skin and wears a gold-colored ring on their left ring finger. On the left side of the board, a camera module with three lenses set in silver-colored metal housings is visible, alongside a large, silver-colored metal shield covering a central portion of the board, surrounded by various small electronic components, connectors, and thin black wires. A silver-colored precision screwdriver with a knurled, hexagonal handle extends from the right side of the frame into the center-left, with its tip touching the bottom-most camera lens. The camera maintains a static, high-angle, top-down perspective throughout the shot, using an extremely shallow depth of field with the focus set on the circuit board in the foreground. The person holds the blue smartphone circuit board steady while using the screwdriver to touch the smallest camera lens. The screwdriver then gently wiggles the lens, causing it to move slightly back and forth within its silver-colored housing. The background is a softly blurred surface with some indistinct dark objects.",

    "Camera": "This is a high-angle shot of a person's hands holding a smartphone's circuit board. The camera uses an extremely shallow depth of field, with the focus set on the circuit board in the foreground.",
    "Subject": "A person with light-colored skin holds a blue smartphone circuit board with both hands, a gold-colored ring visible on their left ring finger. The circuit board features a prominent camera module with three lenses set in silver-colored metal housings. A large, silver-colored metal shield covers a central portion of the board, surrounded by various small electronic components, connectors, and thin black wires. The person uses a silver-colored precision screwdriver with a knurled handle to point at and touch the smallest of the three camera lenses.",
    "Motion": "A person holds a blue smartphone circuit board steady while using a silver-colored precision screwdriver to touch the smallest camera lens. The screwdriver then gently wiggles the lens, causing it to move slightly back and forth within its silver-colored housing.",
    "Scene": "An overhead POV shot provides a top-down perspective of a person's hands holding a blue smartphone circuit board. The board features a prominent camera module with three lenses arranged vertically on the left, alongside a silver-colored metal shield and various other electronic components. A metallic screwdriver with a hexagonal handle is positioned over the board, its tip carefully touching the surface of the smallest, bottom-most camera lens. One of the hands holding the board wears a ring, and the background is a softly blurred surface with some indistinct dark objects.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
