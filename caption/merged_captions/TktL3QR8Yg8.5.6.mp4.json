  "merged_caption": "A close-up shot centers on a creature's face, which occupies the foreground of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, maintaining a fixed and static perspective throughout the clip. The creature remains mostly stationary, with only slight movements as its eyes blink and its mouth opens and closes subtly. This is a static, level-angle shot with an extremely shallow depth of field, keeping the focus sharply on the creature's face in the foreground. In a dark, undefined space, the creature's face is shown under low-key lighting that creates deep shadows. The subject has dark, charcoal-grey skin with a bumpy, leathery, and slightly slick texture. Small, metallic-looking staples are visible on its face, just above its small, dark eyes which have a reddish tint. Its wide mouth is slightly agape, revealing rows of sharp, off-white, needle-like teeth. The head is broad and somewhat flattened, with what appear to be small, dark stitches or markings above its right eye. The background is completely black and out of focus, isolating the centrally positioned subject.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
