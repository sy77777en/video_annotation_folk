  "merged_caption": "This is a medium shot filmed at the subjects' level in a moderately lit medical room lined with light blue curtains. In the foreground, the upper body of a person in light green scrubs and a dark green bandana is positioned on the left side of the frame, viewed from behind. The design on their back resembles a miniature green soccer field, complete with white lines and a small white goal at the top. In the middle ground, a person dressed in a red long-sleeved shirt, red shorts, and a red calf sock on their left leg lies horizontally on a white examination table that extends from the center to the right. Their right leg is elevated and suspended in the air, wrapped in a thick white bandage or cast that extends from their foot to just below their knee, stretching diagonally from the center toward the top right corner. Spanning the top of the frame in the background is a long, illuminated light box displaying several X-ray images of bones. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, utilizing a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. It executes a smooth, continuous movement, simultaneously pulling backward, tilting down, and panning to the left, adding dynamic movement to the static shot where there is no discernible movement from either the person standing or the person lying on the examination table.",

    "Scene": "An indoor scene is set in a moderately lit medical room lined with light blue curtains. In the background, a long, illuminated light box displays several X-ray images of bones. A person in red shorts and a red sock on their left leg lies on an examination table, their right leg elevated and wrapped in a white bandage, suspended by a hook from an overhead bar. Standing with their back to the camera is a figure wearing light green scrubs and a dark green bandana over their hair. The cloth they are wearing resembles a miniature green soccer field, complete with white lines and a small white goal at the top.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
