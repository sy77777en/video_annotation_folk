  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a medium close-up shot of a man with short, dark hair and a medium skin tone, capturing him from the chest up. He is wearing a dark jacket and is positioned slightly off-center to the left in the foreground, with his body facing slightly towards the right side of the frame. In the foreground at the bottom right corner, a partially visible car is present. The dimly lit parking garage serves as the background, featuring concrete pillars and a few bicycles, creating an industrial atmosphere with a muted color palette of grays and browns. The lighting is low, casting soft shadows and adding a sense of isolation. The man’s expression is serious and contemplative, and he seems focused on something outside the frame. As the video progresses, the man begins to walk slowly, his gaze fixed ahead, indicating contemplation or concern. The camera, positioned at eye level, pans left to track the man while subtly moving backward to maintain distance, with a slightly unsteady movement and some shaking. The shot transitions to a close-up, focusing more tightly on the man's face and upper shoulders, shifting his position slightly closer to the center of the frame. The background elements, such as the concrete pillars and bicycles, become less prominent due to the tighter framing. The camera maintains a level height relative to the subject throughout, keeping the man's face and upper body consistently in view. The transition from medium close-up to close-up smoothly narrows the field of vision, emphasizing the man's facial expressions and upper body movements. The scene remains consistent in its industrial tone, with no significant changes in lighting or environment, maintaining a steady, observational perspective throughout.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, focusing on a man in the foreground with a shallow depth of field. It consistently pans left to track the man while subtly moving backward to maintain distance. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video features a man with short, dark hair and a medium skin tone. He is wearing a dark jacket and appears to be in a dimly lit environment. His expression is serious and contemplative. The man is positioned near a car, suggesting he might be interacting with it or preparing to leave. His posture is upright, and he seems to be focused on something outside the frame. The setting appears to be an indoor parking area, adding a sense of isolation to the scene.",
    "Motion": "The man, dressed in a dark jacket, is seen in a dimly lit parking area with concrete pillars and a few bicycles in the background. He begins to walk slowly, his gaze fixed ahead, indicating a sense of contemplation or concern. The camera follows his movement, maintaining a focus on his upper body and face. The background remains consistent, with the parking area's features, such as the pillars and bicycles, remaining visible throughout the sequence.",
    "Scene": "The video is set in an indoor parking garage with a dimly lit, industrial atmosphere. The environment features concrete pillars and walls, with a muted color palette dominated by grays and browns. The lighting is low, casting soft shadows and creating a subdued ambiance. The garage is spacious, with visible structural elements like beams and support columns. A car is partially visible, adding to the utilitarian feel of the setting. The scene remains consistent in its industrial tone, with no significant changes in lighting or environment, maintaining a steady, observational perspective throughout.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
