  "merged_caption": "This is a stationary wide shot of a coastal landscape, focusing on the scenery rather than a single subject. The bottom half of the frame is filled with turbulent ocean waves in the foreground and middle ground, which crash against dark, imposing rock formations in the turquoise ocean. A sea stack is positioned in the lower-left to center middle ground, while a larger cliff face occupies the right side of the frame. In the background, a clear sky fills the top half of the frame, where a flock of birds flies in a loose formation from left to right across the top left quadrant. The camera is positioned at a straight-on angle to the scene and is captured from a fixed, slightly unsteady position above the water. The camera maintains a level angle and a deep focus, keeping the waves, sea stacks, and birds in sharp detail throughout the shot. This slow-motion video captures the large waves with white foam crashing against the rock formations, sending white spray into the air. The flock of birds adds a sense of life to the vast landscape, emphasizing the immense scale and raw, untamed atmosphere of the coastal environment. The composition highlights the powerful interplay between the sea and the land under a clear, light-blue sky, with the video conveying the dramatic seascape scenery shot capturing a powerful ocean scene.",

    "Camera": "This slow-motion video is captured from a fixed, slightly unsteady position above the water. The camera maintains a level angle and a deep focus, keeping the waves, sea stacks, and birds in sharp detail throughout the shot.",
    "Subject": "This is a dramatic seascape scenery shot capturing a powerful ocean scene. Turbulent, turquoise waves with white foamy crests crash violently against large, dark, rugged sea stacks and a towering cliff face under a clear, light-blue sky. A flock of birds flies in a loose formation across the upper portion of the frame, adding a sense of life to the vast landscape. The video does not have a single main subject, as the focus is on conveying the immense scale and raw, untamed atmosphere of the coastal environment. The composition emphasizes the powerful interplay between the sea and the land rather than highlighting a specific object.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenic shot of a rugged coastline on a clear, sunny day. Large waves with white foam crash against dark, imposing rock formations in the turquoise ocean. A flock of birds can be seen flying in formation across the bright blue sky.",
    "Scene": "On a clear day under a light blue sky, a flock of birds flies in formation above a turbulent turquoise ocean. Large, dark, rugged rock formations, including a prominent sea stack and a larger cliff face on the right, rise from the water. White-capped waves continuously crash against the rocks, sending white spray into the air.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
