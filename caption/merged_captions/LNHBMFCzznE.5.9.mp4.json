  "merged_caption": "A medium shot frames a middle-aged white woman with shoulder-length brown hair and bangs from the waist up, positioned in the center of the frame. She stands in the foreground against a large, geometric blue backdrop that fills the background, composed of angular, overlapping planes illuminated in vibrant shades of deep blue. The lighting is focused on the center of the stage, creating a distinct contrast with the dark blue environment. She is wearing a dark, patterned, sleeveless V-neck top with a small microphone clipped to the neckline, accessorized with a simple necklace, a watch, and a ring on her left hand. As she speaks, she gestures with her hands, holding a small black object, possibly a presentation remote, in her right hand. She raises her left hand, pointing her index finger upward to emphasize a point. During her speech, she takes a small step toward the left side of the frame, shifting her position slightly toward the left side of the frame. The camera, filmed from a level, eye-level perspective, maintains a deep focus and executes a smooth pan to the left, tracking the woman as she speaks on stage. She initially faces the left side and eventually turns to face the right side as she continues to talk.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
