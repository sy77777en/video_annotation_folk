  "merged_caption": "The video showcases a full shot of a series of nested Russian dolls, known as matryoshka dolls, arranged in a line on a smooth, light-colored surface against a predominantly white background. The dolls are positioned in the lower half of the frame, extending from the foreground to the background, with the largest doll in the background and the smallest in the foreground. The camera is at the same height as the dolls, providing a direct view of their painted designs. The ultra-shallow depth of field keeps the first doll in the foreground fully in focus, the second doll partially in focus, and the remaining dolls artistically blurred, all captured by a static camera at a level angle. The dolls are wooden, painted primarily in shades of blue and white with orange details, each holding an orange musical instrument and depicting figures with faces and traditional attire. Initially, all dolls are visible and remain stationary. Then, a human hand with a light skin tone enters the frame from the top right, reaching towards the smallest doll at the front of the line. The hand flicks the smallest doll, causing it to move out of the frame, altering the composition to focus on the remaining dolls. The lighting is even, enhancing the overall simplicity of the setting, which remains minimalist with a plain, light-colored background throughout the video.",

    "Camera": "The video showcases four Russian nesting dolls. The ultra-shallow depth of field keeps the first doll in the foreground fully in focus, the second doll partially in focus, and the remaining dolls artistically blurred, all captured by a static camera at a level angle.",
    "Subject": "The video features a set of four Matryoshka dolls arranged in a line from smallest to largest, receding into the background. The dolls are wooden, painted primarily in shades of blue and white with orange details, each holding an orange musical instrument and depicting figures with faces and traditional attire. The smallest doll in the foreground is the most in focus. A human hand with a light skin tone briefly enters the frame from the top right, flicking the smallest doll out of the frame before retracting.",
    "Motion": "The video shows a sequence where a hand interacts with a line of nested Russian dolls, or matryoshka dolls, arranged in decreasing size from back to front. Initially, the dolls remain stationary. Then, a hand enters the scene from above and reaches towards the smallest doll at the front of the line. The hand flicks the smallest doll, causing it to move out of the frame. The remaining dolls stay in place throughout the video.",
    "Scene": "The video showcases a series of Russian nesting dolls on a smooth, light-colored surface against a predominantly white background. The scene captures a hand interacting with the dolls. The lighting is even, enhancing the overall simplicity of the setting.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
