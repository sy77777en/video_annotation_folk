  "merged_caption": "A full shot from a head-mounted camera perspective captures a skier positioned in the center foreground, wearing a black ski helmet, large blue-lensed ski goggles, a black neck gaiter, a red and white varsity-style jacket with \"CU\" on the left chest, black ski pants, tan gloves, and holding yellow ski poles. The skier is on red and black Völkl skis. The camera, mounted on the skier's head, captures a descent down a wide, groomed snowy slope under a clear, bright blue sky. The perspective looks down past the red and black skis, showing the white, tracked snow rushing by. The skier holds their arms out to the sides for balance, opens their mouth to shout loudly, then pulls their arms in closer to their body, sticking out their tongue before retracting it. They maintain a straight trajectory, keeping their skis parallel as they glide down the hill. The camera angle varies with the movement of the skier's head, alternating between being above the skier and at the same level. The skier's torso, legs, and skis are visible at the bottom center of the frame. The wide, snowy slope extends across the foreground, middle ground, and background, filling the entire view. As the skier glides forward, they remain centrally framed while their arms, initially extended to the sides, are brought in closer to their body. This unsteady, high-angle, eye-level shot follows the skier from the front as they move forward down the snowy slope. The camera's Dutch angle varies as it rolls with the skier's movements, exhibiting mild barrel distortion and using a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. The scene is set on a sunny day on a mountain, with a distinct shadow cast on the snow as the skier moves steadily downhill.",

They are wearing a black ski helmet and large, blue-lensed ski goggles that obscure their eyes. A black neck gaiter is pulled up over their chin. Their outerwear is a red and white varsity-style jacket with the white letters \"CU\" on the left chest, worn over black ski pants. On their hands are tan gloves, and they hold yellow ski poles.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
