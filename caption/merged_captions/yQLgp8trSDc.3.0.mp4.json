  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a low-angle wide shot, showing a group of men at the top of a set of stairs, with a large traditional East Asian temple occupying the background. The main subject, a man in white traditional attire with a black belt, long light-colored hair styled in a topknot, and a long light-colored beard, is positioned in the center of the frame, flanked by men in yellow and black robes to his left and right in the middle ground. The temple, characterized by its ornate, curved roof and intricate architectural details, is made of dark wood, contrasting with the light stone steps leading up to it. Stone lion statues flank the entrance, adding a sense of grandeur and historical significance. As the group, including others in gray and black robes, runs on flat ground at the top level of the stairs toward the camera, the camera smoothly zooms in quickly, transitioning into a medium shot, tightening the frame on the central figure. The environment is calm, with clear skies providing ample natural light, emphasizing the temple's serene and timeless atmosphere. In the final composition, the man in white remains in the center, now seen from the waist up, while the men beside him are partially visible on the left and right edges of the frame, all maintaining their position as they advance. The camera remains positioned below the subjects throughout the clip, utilizing deep focus for a large depth of field. The setting suggests a traditional or historical context, with the group positioned on steps indicating a hierarchical or formal arrangement. The main subject's serious expression and prominent stance in the middle ground highlight his leadership role within the group.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
