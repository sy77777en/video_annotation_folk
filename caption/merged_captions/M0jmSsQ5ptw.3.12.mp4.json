  "merged_caption": "The video begins with an extreme wide shot, featuring a tan-skinned woman with dark hair pulled back in a white headband, wearing a pink tank top and black capri-length leggings, in the middle ground, slightly left of center on a long blue mat that extends from the bottom foreground. A tall white wall occupies the left side of the frame, while a paved surface with yellow lines is on the right. In the background on the right, several low, industrial-style buildings are visible on the flat horizon under a sky with scattered white clouds. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, with a fixed, slightly unsteady shot filmed from a hip-level position and a level angle, exhibiting mild barrel distortion. As the woman runs along the blue mat towards the camera, she approaches a low, white, table-like obstacle. She leaps over the obstacle, extending one leg forward, lands on the other side, and continues running forward along the mat. Throughout this motion, she remains in the middle ground, although she gets closer to the foreground, causing the shot to transition into a wide shot. The deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp, capturing the dynamics of her athletic maneuver as she moves across the vast, paved surface, possibly an airfield.",

    "Subject": "A tan-skinned woman with dark hair pulled back in a white headband is shown performing an athletic maneuver. She wears a pink tank top and black capri-length leggings. While running along a blue mat, she leaps over a low, white, table-like obstacle.",
    "Motion": "A woman runs along a long blue mat, approaching a low, white obstacle. She leaps over the obstacle, extending one leg forward, lands on the other side, and continues running forward along the mat.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set outdoors on a vast, paved surface, possibly an airfield, under a sky with scattered white clouds. A long, narrow, dark blue mat with a textured surface and white circular markers extends away from the camera's position. To the left of the mat stands a tall, continuous wall constructed from white fabric panels. To the right, the paved area is marked with double yellow lines. In the background, several low, industrial-style buildings are visible on the flat horizon. A person in athletic attire leaps over a small, raised platform on the mat and continues running forward.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
