  "merged_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of an indoor basketball court with wooden flooring and black painted key areas, captured from a high vantage point above the subjects. The static camera is positioned at an overhead level, approximately at the height of a second floor, looking straight ahead with a level angle and employing deep focus to maintain clarity across the entire scene. The court is surrounded by tiered seating, mostly empty, with red seats on the left side and green seats on the right, all in the foreground and background. The main subject, a man in a dark athletic outfit, is initially positioned in the middle ground, slightly to the right of the center, preparing to catch a basketball. As he catches the ball, the number of people scattered across the court and seating areas decreases rapidly due to a time-lapse effect, leaving only the man playing basketball at the end. The lighting is bright and even, creating a more intimate and focused atmosphere for his practice session. One basketball hoop is located in the middle ground on the left side of the frame, while the other is in the background at the top right corner. The main subject's movement is subtle, primarily involving a slight shift in position as he prepares to dribble the ball and drive towards the basket, with the background becoming increasingly empty. Overlay text in Chinese, \"也不光靠训练,\" briefly appears in the lower left corner of the frame before disappearing. The camera remains stationary throughout, maintaining a consistent overhead perspective that emphasizes the spaciousness of the court and the diminishing presence of other individuals.",

    "Camera": "The video features a static camera positioned at an overhead level, approximately at the height of a second floor, looking straight ahead with a level angle. It employs deep focus, maintaining clarity across the entire basketball court scene.",
    "Subject": "The video begins with a bustling basketball court filled with numerous people. As the main subject, a man in a dark athletic outfit, catches the basketball, many of the other individuals disappear in a time-lapse effect. As he prepares to drive towards the basket, more people vanish, ultimately leaving him alone on the court. The setting is slightly dim, creating a more intimate and focused atmosphere for his practice session.",
    "Motion": "In a dimly lit basketball court, a man in a dark outfit catches a basketball and prepares to dribble it. As he catches the ball, the number of people in the background decreases rapidly, indicating a time-lapse effect. The man then prepares to dribbling the ball, with the background becoming increasingly empty. The court is spacious with wooden flooring and dark blue markings, and the stands are mostly empty, emphasizing the man's solitary practice.",
    "Scene": "The video shows an indoor basketball court with wooden flooring and black painted key areas. The court is surrounded by tiered seating, mostly empty, with red and green sections. Basketball hoops with nets are at each end of the court. Several people are scattered around the court, some standing and others walking, but they gradually disappear due to a time-lapse effect, leaving only one person playing basketball at the end. The lighting is bright and even. Overlay text in Chinese, \"也不光靠训练,\" briefly appears in the lower left corner of the frame before disappearing.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
