  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot, a silhouetted landscape is framed by a large tree in the left middle ground and another on the right. A small, slender creature with two long, pointed ears stands in the center-right of the frame, positioned in the middle ground on a hill. Behind this figure, a large, swirling mass of bright cyan light dominates the background, from which crackling tendrils of energy emanate. The dark blue landscape features hilly terrain with large, leafy trees and undergrowth, and the ground is sparsely dotted with small, glowing white specks. To the right, a larger, bulky creature with a rounded silhouette enters the frame, picks up the small, slender creature, and continues running towards the left side of the frame. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, smoothly moves to the left, observing the silhouetted characters in the mystical, glowing forest.",

    "Scene": "A side-view gaming video captures a nighttime scene in a silhouetted forest. The dark blue landscape features hilly terrain with large, leafy trees and undergrowth. Dominating the background is a vast, swirling expanse of bright cyan light, from which crackling tendrils of energy emanate. The ground is sparsely dotted with small, glowing white specks. A small, silhouetted figure stands on a hill, while a larger, rounded silhouette is visible on the right side of the scene.",

A small, slender creature stands in the center-right of the frame, positioned in the middle ground on a hill. Behind this figure, a large, swirling mass of bright cyan light dominates the background.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
