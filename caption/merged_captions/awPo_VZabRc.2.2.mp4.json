  "merged_caption": "In a hand-drawn animated scene set at dusk, an animated man with a highly stylized and atypical appearance is depicted. He has an extremely slender and elongated physique, with disproportionately long arms and legs that bend at sharp, unnatural angles. His skin is pale, and his face is characterized by a sharp, pointed chin, pointed ears, and black hair styled into a prominent widow's peak. He is dressed in a long, black, high-collared coat over a white shirt and dark trousers, rendered in a sketchy, angular animation style. The scene features wide, gray concrete stairs with solid banisters leading up to a building with a light-colored facade and arched windows emitting a warm, yellow glow. In a full shot, the man is initially seen in the center-right of the frame, in the middle ground, leaping over the left banister of a staircase. The camera trucks left to track him as he jumps over obstacles, slightly zooming in and tilting to make him appear larger in the frame. He lands on the top landing in the center of the frame before moving to the left side. He then contorts his body to descend by clinging to the exterior of the right banister, briefly moving to the bottom of the frame before quickly returning to the center. The staircase occupies the foreground and middle ground, with the building facade and glowing windows in the background. A barred window is visible in the bottom center of the frame, below the main landing. The camera angle is level, and the motion is smooth with minimal shaking. The man seamlessly transitions across multiple staircases, scuttling sideways along the walls at the bottom of each set of stairs, using his hands and feet to propel himself in a spider-like manner.",

    "Motion": "An animated man leaps down a flight of stairs in a contorted, spread-eagled pose, with his long limbs extended. Upon landing, he seamlessly transitions across multiple staircases, scuttling sideways along the walls at the bottom of each set of stairs, using his hands and feet to propel himself in a spider-like manner.",
    "Scene": "In a hand-drawn animated scene set at dusk, a set of wide, gray concrete stairs with solid banisters leads up to the entrance of a building. The building features a light-colored facade, arched windows that emit a warm, yellow glow from within, and doors. Below the main landing of the staircase, a barred window is visible on a lower level. The scene is rendered in a sketchy style with dark outlines, and the building is bathed in warm-toned light, likely from the setting sun.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
