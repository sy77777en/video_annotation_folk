  "merged_caption": "In this medium shot, a man with light skin and short hair, wearing a light blue suit jacket over a white hoodie, is positioned in the right foreground, playing a drum kit. Elements of the drum kit, including two golden, circular metal cymbals, occupy the foreground at the bottom left and bottom center. The cityscape and rooftops fill the background across the frame, with green hills visible in the far background at the top under a grey, overcast sky. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, focusing on the man in the foreground. It uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the foreground sharp while blurring the background. The camera smoothly arcs counterclockwise around the drummer with minimal shaking. The man plays the drum set with focused energy, striking the cymbals and drums rhythmically, maintaining a steady beat. His movements are dynamic, with his arms moving swiftly to hit different parts of the drum set. His body is slightly turned to the side, indicating his engagement with the music. The man is facing away from the camera, concentrating on the drums, with his posture indicating concentration and energy as he plays. The surrounding view includes various other rooftops and a brick chimney, enhancing the urban rooftop setting.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
