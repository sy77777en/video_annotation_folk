  "merged_caption": "The scene begins with a high-angle full shot, positioning a man with dark skin, wearing a yellow hoodie and dark pants, in the center-left foreground and a woman with dark hair, dressed in dark clothing, sitting on a dark, patterned rug in the center-right foreground. A small, old-fashioned CRT television is visible in the top-center background, displaying the head and shoulders of another person. The floor is scattered with a red circular ashtray, a disposable cup, and snack wrappers. The primary illumination comes from a single, focused light source from above, creating a bright spot in the otherwise dimly lit room and casting deep shadows. The camera smoothly cranes down in an arc, transitioning to a high-angle shot of the people below, maintaining deep focus throughout the movement to keep the entire scene sharp. As the camera reframes the scene into a medium shot at the man's level, he brings a lit cigarette or joint to his mouth and inhales, with a gold-colored ring and bracelet visible on his hands. He then extends his arm, offering the cigarette to the woman next to him, who takes it. In this final composition, the man occupies the center-left of the frame, with the television now more prominent in the background behind him, while the woman is partially visible on the far right.",

    "Subject": "A man with dark skin, wearing a yellow hoodie and dark pants, is seen from a high angle in a dimly lit setting. He is sitting or kneeling and brings a lit cigarette or joint to his mouth, with a gold-colored ring and bracelet visible on his hands. Next to him, a woman with dark hair, dressed in dark clothing, is sitting on a patterned rug. In the background, a small, old-fashioned television displays the head and shoulders of another person.",
    "Motion": "A man in a yellow hoodie brings a lit cigarette to his mouth and inhales. He then extends his arm, offering the cigarette to the woman next to him, who takes it. In the background, the television screen consistently displays a man.",
    "Scene": "From a high-angle perspective, the scene is set within a dimly lit room. The floor is covered by a dark, patterned rug featuring red and yellow designs. An old, small CRT television is on, its screen glowing and displaying a continuous video. Scattered on the rug are a red circular ashtray, a disposable cup, and snack wrappers. The primary illumination comes from a single, focused light source from above, creating a bright spot in the otherwise dark space and casting deep shadows.",
    "Spatial": "The scene begins with a high-angle full shot, positioning a man in a yellow hoodie in the center-left foreground and a woman sitting on the floor in the center-right foreground. A small television is visible in the top-center background. The camera then performs a crane down, reframing the scene into a medium shot at the man's level. In this final composition, the man occupies the center-left of the frame, with the television now more prominent in the background behind him, while the woman is partially visible on the far right."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
