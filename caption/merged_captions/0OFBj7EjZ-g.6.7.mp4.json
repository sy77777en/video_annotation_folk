  "merged_caption": "The video showcases a sleek, angular object with a futuristic design, consistently positioned in the center of the frame. Initially, the object is partially submerged in a dark, water-like surface, creating ripples. As the video progresses, the metallic object, with a reflective finish displaying a combination of dark and light tones, rises vertically, changing from the middle ground to the foreground, and the water exits the frame from the bottom. The object, resembling a flattened triangular shape with many angular edges, rotates slightly, highlighting its multifaceted structure and intricate design. Its asymmetrical shape with sharp edges is emphasized as it emerges and floats in the air. A thin, vertical green light remains consistently centered in the background, adding to the visual effect. The camera is positioned at the object's level and dynamically tracks its movement up and down, emphasizing its ascent and rotation. Initially, the camera moves downward, then upward as the object ascends and hangs in midair. The camera then moves forward and backward to examine the object closely, with a shallow focus highlighting the part of the object in the foreground, leaving the farther part blurred. The dark background provides a stark contrast to the dynamic motion of the object. The lower left corner consistently displays the text \"[5]\".",

    "Camera": "The video features smooth camera movements tracking a metallic object. Initially, the camera moves downward, then upward as the object ascends and hangs in midair. The camera then moves forward and backward to examine the object closely. The shallow focus highlights the part of the object in the foreground, leaving the farther part blurred.",
    "Subject": "The video features a sleek, angular object with a futuristic design, resembling a stylized, abstract sculpture. It has a metallic surface with a reflective finish, displaying a combination of dark and light tones that shift as the object rotates. The object resembles a flattened triangular shape with many angular edges. Its shape is asymmetrical, with sharp edges. The object’s orientation changes, highlighting its multifaceted structure and intricate design.",
    "Motion": "A metallic, angular object is seen slightly rotating against a dark background. Half of the object is submerged in a liquid, creating ripples on the surface. As it emerges, it floats in the air. A green light is present within the scene, adding to the visual effect.",
    "Scene": "The video showcases an abstract, minimalist scene with a dark background resembling a water surface. A central metallic object with a sleek, angular design is suspended in the air. A thin, vertical green light is also in the background. There is added text in the lower left corner that shows “[5]”.",
    "Spatial": "The video showcases a sleek, angular object with a futuristic design, consistently positioned in the center of the frame.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
