  "merged_caption": "A high-angle wide shot captures a single, light gray, irregularly shaped rock positioned in the center of the frame, resting motionless on a dark gray, textured surface resembling lunar regolith. The rock is lumpy and somewhat rectangular, with a smooth but contoured surface featuring several indentations and protrusions. The surrounding ground is a darker shade of gray, with a fine, dusty texture and subtle, uneven features, marked by subtle bumps, depressions, and faint linear tracks. The camera smoothly arcs around the rock-like object while descending, maintaining the rock as the focal point. As it gets closer, the camera briefly pauses and zooms in slightly before continuing its clockwise arc around the object. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. Light appears to be cast from the bottom right, creating shadows that accentuate the three-dimensional form of the rock. The scene is cast in a diffuse light that creates soft shadows and faint, broad light bands across the terrain, enhancing the desolate, monochromatic landscape. The textured surface extends across the entire frame, from the foreground to the background, with the rock remaining stationary in the middle ground throughout the video.",

    "Scene": "An objective, high-angle shot captures a desolate, monochromatic landscape. The ground is a dark gray, dusty surface, marked by subtle bumps, depressions, and faint linear tracks. Positioned centrally is a single, light-gray object with a smooth, irregular, and lumpy form. The scene is cast in a diffuse light that creates soft shadows and faint, broad light bands across the terrain.",

The rock remains stationary in the middle ground on a dark, textured surface that extends across the entire frame, from the foreground to the background. The camera moves slightly, altering the perspective while keeping the rock as the focal point."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
