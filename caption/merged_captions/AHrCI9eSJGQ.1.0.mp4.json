  "merged_caption": "This is an extreme wide scenery shot captured from a low-angle perspective on the deck of a container ship at a busy port, presented in a time-lapse format. A large yellow gantry crane occupies the foreground and middle ground, spanning the top half of the frame, with its structural beams and cables filling the upper portion of the scene against a partly cloudy sky. The camera, mounted on the ship, remains static throughout the shot, capturing the crane positioned directly over stacks of red, blue, and grey shipping containers arranged across the ship's deck. The footage exhibits mild barrel distortion, causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward slightly, while a deep focus is maintained throughout, keeping all elements in the frame sharp. The clouds move rapidly across the sky, and as the ship sways slightly on the water, the cranes appear to tilt slightly relative to the ship. Smaller boats are visible moving around in the left part of the frame, while dark lines intermittently appear and disappear on the right side, suggesting the movement of ropes from cranes. In the background, the sea with other vessels is visible in the distance on the left and center, while more of the port, including additional cranes and containers, is visible on the right. An overlay at the bottom of the screen displays white text that reads, \"Cargo Operations will take about 13 hours. During this time some crew will go ashore, some will work, some will rest.\" A red and white \"Tube JEFFHK\" watermark is located in the bottom right corner. The shot lacks a single main subject, as its purpose is to capture the immense scale and overwhelming atmosphere of the industrial environment, emphasizing the grandeur of the machinery and the vastness of the cargo operations.",

    "Camera": "This is a static, time-lapse video shot from an aerial, low-angle perspective. The footage exhibits mild barrel distortion, causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward slightly. A deep focus is maintained throughout, keeping all elements in the frame sharp.",
    "Subject": "This is an industrial maritime scenery shot taken from the deck of a massive container ship docked in a busy port. The perspective is a dramatic low-angle view looking up at a series of enormous yellow gantry cranes that loom directly overhead, their structural beams and cables filling the upper portion of the scene against a partly cloudy sky. These cranes extend into the distance along the line of shipping containers. Below the cranes, the ship's deck is laden with stacks of red, blue, and grey shipping containers, stretching into the distance where the calm sea and other vessels are visible. The shot lacks a single main subject, as its purpose is to capture the immense scale and overwhelming atmosphere of the industrial environment, emphasizing the grandeur of the machinery and the vastness of the cargo operations.",
    "Motion": "This is an extreme wide shot from the deck of a container ship at a busy port, presented in a time-lapse format. The camera, mounted on the ship, captures a massive yellow gantry crane positioned directly over stacks of colorful shipping containers. The clouds move rapidly across the partly cloudy sky, and as the ship sways slightly on the water, the cranes appear to tilt slightly relative to the ship. Smaller boats are visible moving around in the left part of the frame, while dark lines intermittently appear and disappear on the right side, suggesting the movement of ropes from cranes. In the background, the sea, other vessels, and the port's infrastructure are visible.",
    "Scene": "From the deck of a container ship at a bustling industrial port, a massive yellow gantry crane looms directly overhead, its structural arm and cables dominating the view. The ship's deck is laden with stacks of red and blue rectangular shipping containers. In the background, a body of water stretches out, with other ships visible in the distance. To the right, the port's landscape continues with more cranes and stacked containers under a partly cloudy sky. An overlay at the bottom of the screen displays white text that reads, \"Cargo Operations will take about 13 hours. During this time some crew will go ashore, some will work, some will rest.\" A red and white \"Tube JEFFHK\" watermark is located in the bottom right corner.",
    "Spatial": "This is an extreme wide scenery shot captured from a low-angle perspective on the deck of a container ship. A large yellow gantry crane occupies the foreground and middle ground, spanning the top half of the frame. In the foreground at the bottom, stacks of shipping containers are arranged across the ship's deck. The background consists of the sea with other vessels in the distance on the left and center, while more of the port, including additional cranes and containers, is visible on the right. A text overlay is positioned at the bottom of the frame, with a watermark in the bottom right corner. The camera remains static throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
