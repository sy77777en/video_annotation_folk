  "merged_caption": "This video is presented from an isometric, 2.5D perspective, showing a pixel-art bedroom that occupies the central area of the frame. A large window is positioned on the top-left wall, with white closet doors on the right wall. A bed is centered, flanked by a nightstand on its left and another on its right. User interface icons are overlaid in the top-left and top-right corners, as well as along the left and right edges of the screen. Throughout the video, a framed certificate, initially held by a cursor in the bottom-left, is moved over the bed before moving to the closet. A pink stuffed pig appears on the left nightstand, and a cardboard box appears in the bottom-right at the foot of the bed as the camera moves vertically downward. The room contains a double bed with a black headboard and grey chevron-patterned bedding, positioned against a wall with a large window showing a nighttime city. On the bed are several stacks of neatly folded clothes in green, blue, and purple. The bed is flanked by two black nightstands. A pink stuffed pig rests on the left nightstand, while a black digital clock, a speaker, and a grey briefcase sit on the right one. During the video, a framed certificate is manipulated by the mouse and moves around the room, and a cardboard box filled with crumpled paper appears at the foot of the bed. The downward movement of the camera reveals a cardboard box filled with crumpled paper appearing at the foot of the bed. The scene is framed by a gaming user interface, with icons for camera controls, room navigation, and zoom functions in the corners.",

    "Subject": "This video presents an isometric, pixel-art depiction of a bedroom being organized. The room contains a double bed with a black headboard and grey chevron-patterned bedding, positioned against a wall with a large window showing a nighttime city.

    "Motion": "A framed certificate is controlled by a mouse as it is relocated around the room. It pauses at specific locations such as on the carpet, below the left nightstand, and under the bed, ultimately ending in a position overlapping the closet. The downward movement of the camera reveals a cardboard box filled with crumpled paper appearing at the foot of the bed.",
    "Scene": "A third-person isometric (2.5D) gaming video with a tilted overhead angle shows a pixel-art bedroom at night. The room is furnished with a double bed featuring a black headboard and grey chevron-patterned bedding, set against a large window that looks out onto a brightly lit city. The bed is flanked by two black nightstands, and a white bi-fold closet door is visible on the right wall. During the sequence, items are seen in the scene, including a pink stuffed pig on the left nightstand and a cardboard box filled with crumpled paper at the left foot of the bed. A framed certificate is controlled by the mouse and moves around the room. The scene is framed by a gaming user interface, with icons for camera controls, room navigation, and zoom functions in the corners.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
