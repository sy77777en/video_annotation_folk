  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a medium close-up shot of a man with short, dark hair, wearing a brown jacket and carrying a large, beige backpack with multiple compartments and a rectangular patch on the back, as he walks through a field of tall, dry grasses. He is positioned in the center of the frame, with the tall, light brown grasses surrounding him in the foreground and middle ground, swaying gently in the breeze. The grasses extend from the bottom to the top, creating a dense, textured environment around him. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to a medium shot, capturing more of the man's body while maintaining his central position. The camera, at eye level, moves slowly forward, following the man from behind, who gradually becomes smaller in the frame. The movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking, and the man continues to move forward steadily. The background features leafless trees and a partly cloudy sky, situated at the top of the frame, indicating an outdoor, natural environment. The time of day appears to be late afternoon, with soft, diffused sunlight filtering through the sky, casting a warm glow over the scene. The overall atmosphere is calm and natural, with a focus on the interaction between the man and the expansive, serene environment. The spatial dynamics emphasize the interaction between the man and the expansive natural setting, highlighting his journey through the grassy terrain. The background shows a mix of trees and a cloudy sky, suggesting a season of late autumn or early winter. The grasses are slender and topped with feathery plumes, adding texture to the landscape. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout, providing a consistent perspective as it follows his movement, keeping him centered as he navigates through the field.",

    "Camera": "The video features a camera at eye level, maintaining a level angle with deep focus and a large depth of field. The camera moves slowly forward, following a person from behind, who gradually becomes smaller in the frame. The movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video features a man with short, dark hair, seen from behind as he walks through a field of tall, dry grasses. He is wearing a brown jacket and carries a large, beige backpack with multiple compartments. The backpack has a rectangular patch on the back. The man appears to be moving forward, surrounded by the swaying grasses, which are light brown and reach up to his shoulders. The scene conveys a sense of exploration or journey through a natural setting.",
    "Motion": "A man with short, dark hair, wearing a brown jacket and carrying a large, beige backpack, walks through a field of tall, dry grasses. The grasses sway gently in the wind, and the man continues to move forward steadily. The background shows a mix of trees and a cloudy sky, indicating an outdoor, natural environment.",
    "Scene": "The video depicts an outdoor setting in a field of tall, golden grasses swaying gently in the breeze. The time of day appears to be late afternoon, with soft, diffused sunlight filtering through a partly cloudy sky, casting a warm glow over the scene. In the background, leafless trees form a dark silhouette against the sky, suggesting a season of late autumn or early winter. The grasses are slender and topped with feathery plumes, adding texture to the landscape. A person with a backpack is present, moving through the field, their back to the viewer, which adds a sense of scale and direction to the scene. The overall atmosphere is calm and natural, with a focus on the interaction between the person and the expansive, serene environment.",
    "Spatial": "The video starts with a medium close-up shot of the man, focusing on his upper body and head as he walks through the field. He is positioned in the center of the frame, with the tall grasses surrounding him in the foreground and middle ground. The grasses extend from the bottom to the top, creating a dense, textured environment around him. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to a medium shot, capturing more of the man's body while maintaining his central position.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
