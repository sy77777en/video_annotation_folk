  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide shot of a modern train station, featuring a sleek, white high-speed train with blue and grey stripes at the architecturally modern Liège-Guillemins station in Belgium. The train is initially stationary on the tracks in the center-left of the frame, extending from the middle ground to the background. The station platform occupies the right half of the frame, with a woman pulling a suitcase in the middle ground on the right, walking away from the camera. The station's white, latticed roof structure dominates the top of the frame, with sweeping, curved support structures over a spacious grey platform. In the middle ground, other people are visible on the platform and on escalators to the right of the train. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, maintaining a deep focus with a large depth of field, and remains completely static, capturing the train and platform without any movement or shaking. The futuristic, white, open-air structure of the station contrasts with the traditional city visible in the background on a hillside under a partly cloudy sky. The train then begins to move from the middle ground towards the foreground, passing the static, eye-level camera and eventually filling the left side of the frame. A few travelers are walking on the platform, adding a subtle human element to the environment. Towards the end of the shot, white text identifying the location as \"Liège, Belgium\" appears in the bottom right corner, confirming the setting. The focus is on the atmosphere, highlighting the blend of modern engineering, urban life, and human presence, capturing the dynamic interaction between the train, the station, and the people, illustrating the scale and functionality of the space.",

    "Scene": "A sleek, white high-speed train with blue and grey stripes moves along the tracks at a modern, open-air train station in Liège, Belgium. The station features a distinctive white, latticed roof with sweeping, curved support structures over a spacious grey platform. A few people are visible on the platform, including a woman pulling a suitcase, and some individuals are using the escalator while others walk upward. In the background, under a partly cloudy sky, a city with traditional buildings is visible on a hillside. At the end of the video, the location is confirmed as Liège, Belgium, through a white text overlay at the bottom of the screen.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
