  "merged_caption": "A bright cyan light source is positioned at the top center of the frame, set against a dark blue and black background. Numerous thin, vertical streaks of glowing blue light and countless small, twinkling blue particles are distributed throughout the scene. These particles and light streaks exhibit a slow, continuous upward movement, attracted to and gathering around the bright cyan light source, creating a gentle cascade that flows towards the central light source at the top. The particles twinkle as they ascend, creating a steady, shimmering cascade of light through the dark space. The camera remains completely static with a straight-on view throughout the video.",

    "Subject": "This abstract video features numerous small, bright blue, twinkling particles scattered against a dark background. Thin, vertical streaks of glowing blue light appear to be attracted to a concentrated, bright cyan light source at the top center of the scene, creating an effect reminiscent of tiny particles converging into a single point.",
    "Motion": "Numerous small, bright blue particles and thin, vertical streaks of light continuously move upwards, attracted to and gathering around a bright cyan light source located at the top center of the frame. The particles twinkle as they ascend against the dark background, creating a steady, shimmering cascade of light.",
    "Scene": "Against a dark blue and black background, a bright cyan light emanates from the top center of the scene. Thin, vertical streaks of light and countless small, sparkling blue particles continuously ascend towards this glowing source. The shimmering particles and light trails drift slowly upwards, creating a constant, gentle cascade through the dark space.",
    "Spatial": "A bright cyan light source is positioned at the top center of the frame, set against a dark scene. Numerous thin, vertical streaks of blue light and countless small, twinkling blue particles are distributed throughout the scene. These particles and light streaks exhibit a slow, continuous upward movement, creating a gentle cascade that flows towards the central light source at the top. The camera remains static with a straight-on view throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
