  "merged_caption": "The shot, from a fixed perspective attached to a bass guitar's headstock, captures the bassist in the foreground on the right, with a wide view of the stage in the middle ground and background. The guitar's neck and the bassist's fretting hand dominate the foreground, as the left hand moves up and down the fretboard, pressing the strings. The bassist, whose curly dark hair is seen on the right, wears a purple velvet long-sleeved shirt. The bassist's body occupies the right side of the frame. In the middle ground, another performer with large, curly dark hair and a dark outfit is centrally positioned on the stage, playing an instrument near stage equipment. Bright, horizontal light bars are located in the background on the left, casting long, purple-tinged beams that create depth through the hazy air. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, is dynamic; it moves in sync with the bass guitar, swaying, tilting, panning, and rolling as the instrument is played. Filmed from a camera mounted at eye level on the top of a bass, this unsteady shot pans right with intense up-and-down movement and repeated rolling as the bassist spins. The tilting up and down camera movement causes the filming angle to shift dramatically from level to low, then high, and back again. The video exhibits mild barrel distortion and maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field. The stage is illuminated by bright, horizontal light bars and spotlights, casting long, purple-tinged beams through the hazy air. The background consists of the backdrop behind the stage and the live audience in front of the stage.",

    "Subject": "From a perspective fixed to a light-colored bass guitar, the hands of a light-skinned person are visible playing the instrument. This person, whose curly dark hair is seen on the right, wears a purple velvet long-sleeved shirt. Their left hand is shown fretting the dark wood neck of the bass, which has a purple strap with white lettering attached to its headstock. In the middle ground, another performer with large, curly dark hair and a dark outfit stands on a stage, moving around near what appears to be a microphone stand.",
    "Motion": "From a perspective fixed to a bass guitar, a musician's left hand moves up and down the fretboard, pressing the strings. In the middle ground, another performer plays an instrument in place on the brightly lit stage.",
    "Scene": "A locked-on POV shot from a camera mounted to the headstock of a guitar captures a performance on a dimly lit concert stage. The foreground is dominated by the light-colored guitar, showing its fretboard and a hand in a dark velvet sleeve pressing on the strings. In the middle ground, the stage is illuminated by bright, horizontal light bars and spotlights, casting long, purple-tinged beams through the hazy air. Another performer with curly hair is visible in the distance, standing amidst stage equipment, while the camera's perspective remains fixed to the guitar, moving as the instrument is played. The background consists of the backdrop behind the stage and the live audience in front of the stage.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
