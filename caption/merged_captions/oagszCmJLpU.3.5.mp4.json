  "merged_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide scenery shot, capturing a vast landscape under a massive storm. The storm cloud system dominates most of the frame, while a flat prairie occupies a small portion at the bottom. The darkest, most defined shelf-like structure initially stretches from the center to the left, with lighter, higher clouds filling the top and right portions of the frame. As the video progresses, the heavy cloud mass extends across the frame from left to right. Curtains of precipitation are visible falling in the bottom center and bottom left background, connecting the cloud base to the land. The horizon line is situated low in the background. The camera is positioned at a low angle, looking up, which emphasizes the scale of the storm. In the time-lapse, the clouds churn and billow, with the entire formation showing dynamic internal movement as it progresses across the scene. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire landscape and sky sharp, and performs a slow, smooth pan from left to right, following the dramatic movement of the storm clouds. A colossal, dark supercell storm cloud with a defined, shelf-like structure dominates the sky, its turbulent base churning ominously. Below the darkest part of the formation, the atmosphere is tinged with a sickly green light, a common indicator of severe weather, as curtains of heavy precipitation fall onto the flat, open prairie below. The sheer size of the weather system, filling the entire upper portion of the frame, makes the storm itself the central element, highlighting the raw power of nature. The sky is dominated by a vast, dark shelf cloud with layered gray and white textures. The underside of the cloud is nearly black, and a distinct green hue colors the atmosphere where sheets of rain fall in the distance.",

    "Camera": "This is a time-lapse video shot from a low angle, positioned somewhere between eye-level and overhead. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire landscape and sky sharp. It performs a slow, smooth pan from left to right, following the dramatic movement of the storm clouds.",
    "Subject": "This video is a dramatic landscape scenery shot, focusing on the immense scale and atmosphere of the environment rather than a specific main subject. A colossal, dark supercell storm cloud with a defined, shelf-like structure dominates the sky, its turbulent base churning ominously. Below the darkest part of the formation, the atmosphere is tinged with a sickly green light, a common indicator of severe weather, as curtains of heavy precipitation fall onto the flat, open prairie below. The sheer size of the weather system, filling the entire upper portion of the frame, makes the storm itself the central element, highlighting the raw power of nature.",
    "Motion": "This video is a scenery shot. It captures a massive, dark, and ominous storm cloud formation looming over a flat, grassy landscape. A greenish hue, often indicative of severe weather like hail, is visible on the left side of the storm system.",
    "Scene": "A time-lapse captures a massive, turbulent storm system moving across a flat, grassy plain. The sky is dominated by a vast, dark shelf cloud with layered gray and white textures. The underside of the cloud is nearly black, and a distinct green hue colors the atmosphere where sheets of rain fall in the distance. The clouds churn and swirl as the storm advances across the wide, open landscape under a darkened daytime sky. The horizon is a thin line of subtle brown hills in the far distance.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
