  "merged_caption": "From a high-angle, point-of-view perspective, the front half of a blue race car and its driver occupy the foreground and middle ground in the bottom half of the frame. The driver's helmet is in the bottom center, with their hands on the steering wheel, and the car's nose cone extends towards the center. The front wheels are positioned in the middle left and middle right. The asphalt racetrack fills the middle of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground as it curves to the right. In the background, a grassy landscape and rolling hills span the upper portion of the frame, with a cloudy sky positioned at the top. The entire scene moves as the car speeds forward, causing the track and scenery to rush towards the fixed camera. The driver steers the blue race car through a left-hand curve on a paved racetrack, turning the steering wheel to guide the car along the bend while maintaining a steady forward motion. This video is captured from a slightly unsteady, high-angle, eye-level perspective, with the camera mounted above and behind the driver of a race car. The camera follows the car from behind as it moves forward along the track. As the car navigates a left turn downhill, the camera pans slightly left and tilts down with it. The shot features mild barrel distortion and maintains a deep focus, keeping both the car's interior and the distant track in sharp view. The car, an open-wheel model, features the words \"GoPro\" and \"Be a HERO.\" in white text on its nose cone, with its front wheels and suspension visible on either side. The driver wears a black helmet that covers their head. Their legs and arms are clad in a white and black patterned racing suit, and their hands are covered by black racing gloves with white and red details, including the \"SPARCO\" brand name.",

    "Subject": "From a slightly elevated perspective above the driver's head, a driver is seated in the open cockpit of a blue race car.

    "Motion": "The driver steers the blue race car through a left-hand curve on a paved racetrack, turning the steering wheel to guide the car along the bend while maintaining a steady forward motion.",
    "Scene": "A locked-on POV shot from a camera mounted on a light blue, open-wheel race car shows the vehicle speeding along a paved racetrack during the daytime. The dark asphalt track initially curves to the left, then shifts to a right curve, bordered by a grassy runoff area. In the distance, rolling green hills stretch out beneath a cloudy, overcast sky. The front of the car, marked with a white \"GoPro\" logo, dominates the lower portion of the view, with the driver's gloved hands on the steering wheel and the top of a black helmet visible in the cockpit.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
