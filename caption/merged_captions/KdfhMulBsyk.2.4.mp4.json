  "merged_caption": "In a close-up, over-the-shoulder shot, a young man with short, light-colored hair, wearing a dark shirt and a blue baseball cap worn forwards, is positioned in the foreground on the left side of the frame, with his back to the camera. The camera, positioned at his level, follows him from an unsteady, eye-level perspective as he walks forward into a blurred crowd of people occupying the middle ground and background across the center and right of the frame. As he moves, his position remains stable on the left, while the out-of-focus background elements, including indistinct figures and bright lights, shift past him. The scene is set in a brightly lit, crowded indoor space, possibly a parking garage or an underground area, with a cool, desaturated color palette. The background is heavily blurred, with bright, out-of-focus overhead lights creating large bokeh effects. Among the indistinct figures in the background, one person is visible wearing a light-colored sweater, and another is in a blue jacket, though their features are out of focus. A white vehicle is also visible in the distance, all rendered with a shallow depth of field. The camera maintains this shallow depth of field, focusing on the man while blurring the crowded background, tracking his movement as he navigates through the indistinct motion of the people around him.",

    "Camera": "From an unsteady, eye-level perspective, the camera follows a man in a blue cap from behind as he moves forward. The shot maintains a shallow depth of field, focusing on the man while blurring the crowded background.",
    "Subject": "A young man with short, light-colored hair is seen from behind, wearing a dark shirt and a blue baseball cap worn forwards. He is walking forward into a blurred crowd of people. Among the indistinct figures in the background, one person is visible wearing a light-colored sweater, and another is in a blue jacket, though their features are out of focus.",
    "Motion": "A young man in a blue cap walks forward, moving through a crowded, out-of-focus environment. The camera follows closely from behind, tracking his movement as he navigates through the indistinct motion of the people around him.",
    "Scene": "An over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind the character, showing their upper body and the scene ahead, follows a person in a blue baseball cap and a dark shirt. They move through a brightly lit, crowded indoor space, possibly a parking garage or an underground area. The background is heavily blurred, with bright, out-of-focus overhead lights creating large bokeh effects. Other indistinct figures and a white vehicle are visible in the distance, all rendered with a shallow depth of field. The scene has a cool, desaturated color palette.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
