  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot, a silhouetted person stands in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, enveloped in bright, orange, lightning-like tendrils of energy that originate from a point above the person's left hand. The person, who appears to have dark hair and is wearing dark clothing, stands motionless with her hands spread out in front of her chest, palms facing upward, as if interacting with the glowing energy. The energy tendrils dynamically writhe and expand, occupying the foreground and middle ground as they move across the left, right, top, and bottom of the frame, constantly changing shape and intensity. The indistinct environment includes a railing-like structure in the midground, positioned behind the central figure, and is set in a dark, hazy setting with a purplish-red ambiance. The video is presented with black bars on the left and right sides, and a horizontal line of color distortion is visible at the bottom of the screen, characteristic of older video formats. From an unsteady, eye-level position, the camera maintains a level angle as it arcs counterclockwise around the figure, with noticeable shaking, causing the overall image to appear blurred and unclear. The person remains mostly stationary in the center, while the energy tendrils constantly change shape and position around them, creating a dynamic display.",

    "Camera": "From an unsteady, eye-level position, the camera maintains a level angle as it arcs counterclockwise around a figure enveloped in orange energy. The movement is characterized by noticeable shaking, and the special effects cause the overall image to appear blurred and unclear.",
    "Subject": "In a dimly lit, low-resolution scene, a person is visible as a dark silhouette. Bright, orange, lightning-like tendrils of energy crackle and move in irregular paths around the character, creating a dynamic display. The person, who appears to have dark hair and is wearing dark clothing, stands motionless with her hands spread out in front of her chest, as if interacting with the glowing energy.",
    "Motion": "A silhouetted person stands motionless with their hands held out in front of them, palms facing upward. Bright, orange, lightning-like tendrils of energy continuously crackle and flow in irregular paths around the person, constantly changing shape and intensity.",
    "Scene": "In a dark, hazy setting with a purplish-red ambiance, a bright, crackling line of orange energy moves and writhes around a central, silhouetted figure. The indistinct environment includes a railing-like structure in the midground. The video is presented with black bars on the left and right sides, and a horizontal line of color distortion is visible at the bottom of the screen, characteristic of older video formats.",
    "Spatial": "In a medium shot, a silhouetted person stands in the center of the frame and in the middle ground.

The person remains mostly stationary in the center, while the energy tendrils constantly change shape and position around them. A railing-like structure is visible in the middle ground, positioned behind the central figure. The camera is positioned at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
