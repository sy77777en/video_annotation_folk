  "merged_caption": "The video presents a full shot of a young man dressed in white attire with orange stripes, including a long-sleeved shirt, pants, gloves, and a cap, moving across a minimalist stage. Initially, he stands on a raised black platform located in the upper center of the frame, with the camera positioned below him at eye level, using a low angle. The environment features a stark black backdrop, creating a dramatic contrast with the subject's white outfit. The stage includes a raised platform and a large panel on the left side, contributing to the abstract aesthetic. The bright lighting emphasizes the contrast between the subject and the dark background. The young man begins his movement by stepping off the platform, transitioning from the top center towards the middle of the frame. As he descends, the camera smoothly tilts down at varying speeds, slightly panning left to follow his movement, maintaining a full shot. He carefully lowers himself, using his hands for support as he maneuvers off the ledge. Swinging his legs over the edge, he lands smoothly on the ground below, stands up, and looks ahead, completing his descent. The camera shifts to match his level, transitioning to a high angle with deep focus and a large depth of field, capturing the subject's fluid transition from the raised platform to the lower stage area. The large panel in the lower left corner gradually becomes more visible as the camera moves, eventually shifting to the left side of the frame. The subject's dynamic movement contrasts sharply with the static elements of the stage, emphasizing his actions against the stark black backdrop. The overall scene is devoid of additional props or furniture, focusing on the simplicity and visual impact of the contrasting colors and shapes.",

    "Camera": "The video features a camera at eye level, initially using a low angle and transitioning to a high angle. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera smoothly tilts down at varying speeds, slightly panning left to follow a child in a white uniform jumping from a height onto a platform, causing the subject to appear larger in the frame.",
    "Subject": "The video features a young man dressed in white attire with orange stripes, including a long-sleeved shirt, pants, gloves, and a cap, with a light skin tone.",
    "Motion": "The young man stands on a black platform and begins to step down onto a white ledge. He carefully lowers himself, using his hands for support as he maneuvers off the ledge. Swinging his legs over the edge, he lands smoothly on the ground below, stands up, and looks ahead, completing his descent.",
    "Scene": "The video showcases an indoor setting with a minimalist stage design. The environment features a stark black backdrop, creating a dramatic contrast with the subject dressed in a white outfit, complete with a cap and gloves. The stage includes a raised platform and a large panel on the left side, contributing to the abstract aesthetic. The bright lighting emphasizes the contrast between the subject and the dark background. As the scene progresses, the subject moves from the higher black platform to a lower one. The overall scene is devoid of additional props or furniture, focusing on the simplicity and visual impact of the contrasting colors and shapes.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
