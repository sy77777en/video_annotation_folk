  "merged_caption": "A full shot displays a scene set against a dark background with a faint grid on the floor. In the center of the frame and the middle ground, a translucent blue figure of a man stands behind a simple, brown, four-legged wooden table. The man is wearing what appears to be a collared shirt and trousers, with his hands in his trousers' pockets. A glowing red-orange rectangular box rests on the table, emitting a bright fiery glow. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays the name \"Georg Elser\" in a white, typewriter-style font, with the text changing from \"[2,3,4]\" to \"[5,6]\". From a high, eye-level perspective, the camera executes a smooth counterclockwise arc, moving forward and down towards the table. As the camera moves, the table shifts from the middle ground center to the foreground bottom center, while the translucent blue figure remains in the middle ground center. The human-like figure remains oriented towards the camera as it moves, while the table and the glowing box stay stationary. A deep focus keeps the entire scene, including the blue figure and the glowing box, sharp.",

The man is wearing what appears to be a collared shirt and trousers, with his hands in his trousers' pockets. On the table sits a rectangular box that emits a bright, fiery red-orange glow.

    "Motion": "The human-like figure remains oriented towards the camera as it moves, while the table and the glowing box stay stationary.",
    "Scene": "In a dark, undefined space with a faint grid pattern on the floor, a simple wooden table is positioned in the center. A translucent, blue, human-like figure stands behind the table. On the tabletop, a rectangular object emits a bright red glow. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays the name \"Georg Elser\" in a white, typewriter-style font, and the text changes from \"[2,3,4]\" to \"[5,6].\"",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
