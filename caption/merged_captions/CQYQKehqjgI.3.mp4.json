  "merged_caption": "This close-up shot, filmed from a high angle looking down, focuses on a glass bowl in the center of the middle ground. A light-skinned person's hand in the foreground extends from the top left to the top center, holding a metal wire whisk that moves in a rapid circular motion to mix finely chopped green herbs, a white crystalline powder, and a light greenish liquid within the central bowl. The camera remains static, using a shallow depth of field to focus on the background ingredients. To the left in the middle ground, a wooden board holds halved and squeezed green limes, a silver and red plastic measuring spoon, and a yellow squeezer, while a blurred bunch of fresh green herbs in a glass container occupies the bottom-left corner of the foreground. In the background at the top right, a silver bowl contains several whole limes and a smaller measuring spoon. A clear glass jar with a handwritten label reading \"SEA SALT\" is filled with coarse white salt and is positioned to the right in the middle ground. The scene is brightly lit, with all ingredients and tools thoughtfully arranged. The surrounding elements remain static throughout the shot, enhancing the dynamic motion of the whisking action in the center.",

    "Subject": "A light-skinned person's hand holds a metal wire whisk, actively mixing ingredients within a large, clear glass bowl. The bowl contains a mixture of finely chopped green herbs, a white crystalline powder, and a light greenish liquid. On the left side of the bowl, there are halved and squeezed green limes, a silver and red plastic measuring spoon, and a yellow squeezer, all placed on a wooden chopping board on the table. A bunch of fresh green herbs in a glass container is visible beside the chopping board. On the right side, a silver bowl contains several limes, and a smaller measuring spoon similar to the one on the left. Additionally, a clear glass jar with a handwritten label reading \"SEA SALT\" is filled with coarse white salt.",
    "Motion": "A person's hand holds a metal whisk and moves it in a rapid, circular motion inside a clear glass bowl, stirring and combining the chopped green herbs, white powder, and light greenish liquid within.",
    "Scene": "An overhead POV shot captures a vibrant food preparation scene on a light-colored, weathered wood plank surface. In the center, a hand uses a metal wire whisk to mix finely chopped green herbs, a white crystalline powder, and a light greenish liquid in a large, clear glass bowl. To the left, halved and squeezed green limes, a silver and red plastic measuring spoon, and a yellow squeezer rest on a wooden chopping board. A bunch of fresh green herbs stands in a glass container nearby. On the right, a silver bowl holds several whole limes and a smaller measuring spoon. A clear glass jar with a handwritten label reading \"SEA SALT\" contains coarse white salt. The scene is brightly lit, with all ingredients and tools thoughtfully arranged in the middle ground and background.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
