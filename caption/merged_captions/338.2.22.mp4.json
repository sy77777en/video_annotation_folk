  "merged_caption": "The video features a medium shot of a woman with long brown hair tied in a ponytail, wearing a white shirt, a maroon vest, and a blue backpack, walking through a busy restaurant. The camera remains at her level, capturing her from behind as she moves forward in a third-person over-the-hip POV. Initially, she is centered in the frame, occupying the foreground. As she progresses, her position shifts slightly to the left while remaining in the foreground. The camera smoothly moves forward to follow her as she delivers water to a table. The restaurant is filled with people sitting at tables, eating, and conversing, contributing to a lively atmosphere. The tables and diners are distributed across the middle ground and background, with some individuals seated on the left and others on the right. Notably, a man in a beige shirt is positioned in the middle ground on the left side, gesturing with his hand, possibly talking to someone. The woman reaches the table and begins to serve food. The restaurant's interior, with its warm lighting and decorative wooden panels, forms the backdrop, extending into the background. The ceiling is adorned with ornate designs, adding to the restaurant's traditional aesthetic. The camera maintains a steady perspective, keeping the woman as the focal point while showcasing the surrounding activity. The server becomes smaller in the frame as she moves forward, ending with a slight pan to the left when the water is placed on the table. The overall ambiance is vibrant, with a mix of people and activity contributing to the dynamic scene. The time of day is not explicitly indicated, but the indoor lighting suggests a well-lit, possibly evening setting.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information.
