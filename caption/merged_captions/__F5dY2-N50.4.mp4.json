  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot with no main subjects, capturing an outdoor garden path. Initially, a patio occupies the bottom foreground, featuring a round, dark-colored table with a glass top in the bottom right, on which sits a small, white, square box. A path of rectangular, dark gray stepping stones extends from the bottom center foreground into the sandy middle ground, where a large tree with a thick, dark trunk stands in the center. A low, light-colored wall runs along the left edge, and dense, green tropical foliage fills the background, creating a secluded atmosphere. The video starts with a high-angle shot and smoothly transitions to an eye-level angle as the camera tilts upward, using deep focus to keep the entire patio and garden path sharp. As it tilts, the foreground patio diminishes, and the table shifts toward the bottom right corner, while the stepping stone path and the sandy area remain central. The camera's movement serves to reveal the layout and features of the space rather than to follow a specific person or object, emphasizing the serene and secluded atmosphere of the tropical environment. The entire scene is captured during the daytime, highlighting the smooth, light-gray floor of the patio and the contrast between the dark stepping stones and the light-colored sand. The garden is enclosed by lush green foliage, enhancing the tranquil, private nature of the setting.",

    "Scene": "An outdoor scene during the daytime shows a patio area leading into a sandy garden. The foreground features a smooth, light-gray floor with a round, dark-colored table that has a glass top. On the table sits a small, white, square box. A path made of rectangular, dark gray stepping stones extends from the patio across the light-colored sand. The garden is enclosed by dense, green tropical foliage and trees, including a prominent tree with a thick, dark trunk in the center. A low, light-colored wall runs along the left side of the scene.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
