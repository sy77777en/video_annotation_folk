  "merged_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of a man with a medium-dark skin tone, short dark hair, and wearing a light yellow polo shirt, seated at a table in a warmly lit restaurant. The man occupies the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground, and is seated directly facing the camera, which is at his eye level. The camera is at a level angle, focusing on the man with a shallow depth of field, and remains completely static throughout the sequence. Behind him, two large, ornate circular archways with intricate designs dominate the background, symmetrically placed on the left and right sides of the frame. Within these archways, blurred figures of people can be seen moving around, indicating a busy restaurant environment. The table in front of the man holds a neatly folded napkin. The environment is characterized by intricate, circular wooden archways with ornate carvings, and the lighting is soft and ambient, casting a cozy glow over the scene. The overall atmosphere is inviting, with rich, warm colors and detailed decor contributing to a sense of elegance and cultural richness. The man begins speaking, and his head moves slightly as he talks. He then raises his left hand, gives a thumbs-up gesture, and lowers it. The background shows other people moving around, suggesting a bustling restaurant environment. The man maintains a calm expression as he speaks and gestures with his hands. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial positioning during the sequence.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
