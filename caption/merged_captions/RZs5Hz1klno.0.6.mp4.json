  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a humanoid figure with a smooth, featureless, metallic silver face and neatly combed silver hair, positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground. The figure is dressed in a dark blazer over a white V-neck shirt, with the collar visible, and its neck area is made of the same smooth, silver material as the face. The scene is set in a dimly lit room at night, with a lamp visible in the bottom right foreground and a blurred background featuring a French window on the left with a dark night view and a door on the right with a little light visible. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, maintains a smooth, eye-level shot with a level angle, utilizing a shallow depth of field to keep both the mannequin-like figure and the lamp in focus. The camera moves forward while gently panning left and tilting up, transitioning to a medium close-up shot as it closes in on the figure, which remains completely still, facing forward without any movement throughout the video. White subtitles are displayed as an overlay at the bottom of the scene, showing only a small \"[2]\" on the lower left.",

    "Subject": "A humanoid figure with a smooth, featureless, metallic silver face is shown facing forward. Its silver hair is neatly combed back, with individual strands visible. The figure is dressed in a dark blazer over a white V-neck shirt, with the collar of the shirt visible. The visible neck area is made of the same smooth, silver material as the face.",
    "Motion": "The humanoid figure remains completely still, facing forward without any movement throughout the video.",
    "Scene": "In a dimly lit room at night, a mannequin-like figure with a featureless silver face and silver hair stands in the center. The figure is wearing a dark blazer over a white shirt. The background is blurred, revealing a French window on the left with a dark night view, a door on the right with a little light visible, and part of a lamp in front of the right side. White subtitles are displayed as an overlay at the bottom of the scene, showing only a small \"[2]\" on the lower left.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium shot of a humanoid figure positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground. A lamp is visible in the bottom right foreground, while a window and a door are in the blurred background to the left and right, respectively. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, then moves closer to the figure, transitioning to a medium close-up shot while the subject remains centrally framed."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
