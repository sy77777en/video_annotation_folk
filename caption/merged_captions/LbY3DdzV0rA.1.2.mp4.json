  "merged_caption": "This is an extreme wide shot of a vast landscape, with no main subject. The bottom third of the frame is occupied by an arid desert landscape that extends from the foreground into the middle ground, covered in sparse green and brown vegetation. A range of low, dark mountains stretches horizontally across the scene in the background. The top two-thirds of the frame are dominated by a heavy, dark sky filled with storm clouds tinged with purple and grey. Columns of intense rain are visible falling from the clouds, primarily in the center of the frame over the distant mountain peak, with additional rain shafts on the left and right sides. The camera is positioned at a high elevation, looking out over the scene, and the shot slowly pans to the left, capturing the dynamic nature of the powerful weather system. This is a time-lapse video of a storm forming over a desert landscape, with the camera positioned between overhead and eye level, using a low angle and a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp. The limited view of the ground makes it difficult to determine the exact height. The composition emphasizes the dramatic contrast between the violent storm and the sprawling, empty landscape, as the camera's slow, smooth pan from right to left reveals the immense scale and powerful atmosphere of the weather event.",

    "Subject": "This is a dramatic landscape scenery shot featuring a vast, turbulent sky filled with dark, heavy storm clouds tinged with purple and grey. Visible columns of intense rain pour down from the cloud base, concentrating in the center of the frame over a distant mountain peak. Below, a wide, arid expanse of brownish-green desert scrubland stretches towards the range of dark, rugged mountains on the horizon. There is no main subject, as the focus is on capturing the immense scale and powerful atmosphere of the weather event. The composition emphasizes the dramatic contrast between the violent storm and the sprawling, empty landscape.",
    "Motion": "This is an extreme wide shot of a dramatic storm over a desert landscape. The camera slowly pans to the left, capturing the dynamic nature of the powerful weather system. Dark, heavy clouds fill the sky, with visible sheets of rain falling over distant mountains.",
    "Scene": "An outdoor scene captures a vast, arid landscape under a dramatic, stormy sky. A range of low, dark mountains stretches across the horizon. The terrain extends across the foreground and middle ground, covered in sparse green and brown vegetation. The sky is filled with heavy, dark gray and purple clouds, from which distinct shafts of heavy rain are seen falling over the distant mountains.",
    "Spatial": "This is an extreme wide shot of a vast landscape, with no main subject.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
