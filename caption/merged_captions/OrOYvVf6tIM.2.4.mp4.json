  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a woman with short blonde hair, wearing a grey V-neck T-shirt and dark pants, standing in the background at the center of the frame, while a close-up simultaneously shows a person's left hand and forearm in a dark long-sleeved shirt and a watch centered in the foreground, partially obscuring the woman. The hand opens a wooden drawer with a red-painted front, which then occupies the bottom of the frame, with a countertop visible in the upper right. As the hand opens the drawer, the focus shifts from the woman in the background to the hand and drawer in the foreground. The hand reaches into the drawer, retrieves a black flashlight, activates it, and casts its beam toward the center right while closing the drawer, illuminating the underside of the countertop. The camera initially pans quickly to the right, capturing the middle ground, a woman in the background, and areas further back clearly, while the table and a man are slightly blurred. A rack focus then shifts attention to the foreground, where the part of the table and the drawer closest to the camera come into sharp view, though the man holding items remains slightly blurred. The bright, circular beam of light sweeps across the interior, illuminating the light-colored wood of the drawer and the speckled pattern on the underside of a granite countertop above. In the softly lit hallway, a woman stands with a framed picture visible on the wall to her right, on the left side of the frame. Dark wooden cabinets are also present in the room. The camera consistently stays at the subject's level throughout the shot.",

    "Camera": "This is a hip-level shot with a level angle. The video begins with a quick pan to the right, capturing the middle ground, a woman in the background, and areas further back clearly, while the table and a man are slightly blurred. A rack focus then shifts attention to the foreground, where the part of the table and the drawer closest to the camera come into sharp view, though the man holding items remains slightly blurred.",
    "Subject": "A woman with short blonde hair, wearing a grey V-neck T-shirt and dark pants, stands in the background. In the foreground, the left hand and forearm of a person in a dark long-sleeved shirt and a watch are visible. This person's hand opens a wooden drawer. The focus shifts from the woman to the opened drawer as the hand picks up a black flashlight from inside the drawer and turns it on, casting a beam of light.",
    "Motion": "A person's hand opens a wooden drawer, retrieves a black flashlight, turns it on to cast a beam of light, and then pushes the drawer closed. In the background, a woman stands still.",
    "Scene": "From a perspective beside a wooden drawer with a red-painted front, the view looks toward the drawer and into a dimly lit room at night. A hand reaches into the drawer, retrieves a black flashlight, and turns it on. The bright, circular beam of light sweeps across the interior, illuminating the light-colored wood of the drawer and the speckled pattern on the underside of a granite countertop above. In the softly lit hallway, a woman stands with a framed picture visible on the wall to her right, on the left side of the frame. Dark wooden cabinets are also present in the room.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a full shot of a woman standing in the background at the center of the frame, while a close-up simultaneously shows a person's hand and arm centered in the foreground, partially obscuring the woman. The hand opens a wooden drawer, which then occupies the bottom of the frame, with a countertop visible in the upper right. As the hand opens the drawer, the focus shifts from the woman in the background to the hand and drawer in the foreground. The hand reaches for a flashlight, activates it, and casts its beam toward the center right while closing the drawer, illuminating the underside of the countertop. The camera initially pans quickly to the right but consistently stays at the subject's level throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
