  "merged_caption": "In a medium close-up shot, a person with light skin and short, light-colored hair styled with several large, orange hair curlers is positioned in the foreground and center of the frame, smiling towards the camera. She is wearing large, white, rectangular-framed sunglasses and a dark brown robe or dressing gown draped over her shoulders. A beaded bracelet with orange and brown beads is visible on her right wrist. Her right arm, initially raised with a clenched fist, moves towards the camera and then retracts, followed by the left fist, as she alternately swings both arms. The scene is set indoors, in what appears to be a dimly lit salon or dressing room. In the middleground, a dome-shaped hair dryer, colored blue and white, is visible in the top center. To the left in the background, a large circular mirror reflects a black and white checkered pattern, and slightly to its right, a wooden shelving unit with vertical orange light strips is also in the background. The overall lighting is moody, with teals and blues dominating the ambiance, punctuated by the warm orange lights. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, maintaining a shallow depth of field with focus on the foreground. The video exhibits mild barrel distortion, and the camera movement is quite unsteady and lacks a clear pattern, remaining at the subject's level throughout the shot.",

    "Scene": "The scene is set indoors, in what appears to be a dimly lit salon or dressing room. A prominent, dome-shaped hair dryer, colored blue and white, is visible in the upper center. To the left, a large, circular mirror reflects a black and white checkered pattern. Vertical, glowing orange light strips are positioned near a wooden shelving unit in the background. The overall lighting is moody, with teals and blues dominating the ambiance, punctuated by the warm orange lights. A person with curlers in their hair and wearing white, square-rimmed sunglasses is in the foreground, moving slightly.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
