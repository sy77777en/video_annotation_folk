  "merged_caption": "This wide shot is captured from a ground-level, level-angle perspective at the same height as the subject, with an out-of-focus pebbly shore in the foreground at the bottom of the frame. In the background, a man wearing a blue, short-sleeved top, black shorts, black gloves, and a helmet that is blue, white, and yellow is riding a red bicycle on the surface of the water, positioned in the top-center, performing a stunt. The man faces left and propels himself and the bicycle upwards, spinning in the air before returning to his original position. At the end of the stunt, he pedals forward slightly, all on the surface of the choppy water. The water extends from the middle ground to the background, with a large rock formation visible in the background to the top center-right and an overcast sky filling the top portion of the frame. The scene is viewed from a static, ground-level shot with a level angle. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the background—a person on a bicycle in the water—in focus while the pebbly beach in the foreground is blurred. The scene looks out over a body of rippling water under a bright, overcast sky. In the distance, a solitary rock formation rises from the water near the flat horizon. The foreground is composed of out-of-focus, multi-colored pebbles and sand, with small waves gently lapping at the shoreline.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
