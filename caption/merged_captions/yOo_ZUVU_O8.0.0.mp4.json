  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a wide shot in black and white, where a man in a suit and hat is positioned in the foreground on the left rooftop. He handles a long, light-colored wooden plank, also in the foreground on the left. Another rooftop is visible in the foreground on the right. Below, a hazy city street occupies the middle ground, receding towards faintly visible buildings in the background. Several dark utility wires are strung horizontally across the top of the frame, appearing in the middle ground. The camera is positioned at a subject-level angle, maintaining a deep focus with a large depth of field, and remains fixed but exhibits slight unsteadiness. The man lifts the plank and places one end on the left rooftop, with the other end extending towards the right rooftop, overhanging the street in the middle ground. He looks back briefly before stepping onto the overhanging end of the plank, moving from the foreground left to the foreground center, still above the middle ground street. He then jumps from the plank towards the right rooftop, remaining in the foreground as he moves from the center to the right. At the end of the video, he grabs the edge of the other building's roof with his hands. The scene, captured from an objective point of view, presents a level-angle perspective from the height of the rooftops, overlooking a hazy city street populated with indistinct vehicles that recede into a foggy or smoky distance where other buildings are faintly visible, contributing to the urban atmosphere.",

    "Subject": "In a black-and-white video, a man in a suit and hat is on a rooftop. He lifts a long wooden plank and places it at the edge of the rooftop, with one end hanging over and pointing towards an adjacent rooftop. He then stands on the plank and jumps towards the adjacent rooftop. Beneath his feet is a distant view of the street.\n",
    "Motion": "A man on a rooftop lifts a long wooden plank and positions it so one end extends over the edge towards an adjacent rooftop. Before making the jump, he looks back briefly, then steps onto the overhanging end of the plank and jumps across the gap. At the end of the video, he grabs the edge of the other building's roof with his hands.",
    "Scene": "This black and white vintage film, captured from an objective point of view, presents a level-angle perspective from the height of the rooftops, overlooking a hazy city street. The scene is set on the flat rooftops of two brick buildings in the foreground. A person places one end of a long, light-colored wooden plank on the left rooftop while the other end remains suspended, using it to assist in jumping to the other rooftop. Below, the street, populated with indistinct vehicles, recedes into a foggy or smoky distance where other buildings are faintly visible. Several dark utility wires are strung horizontally across the upper portion of the view, contributing to the urban atmosphere.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
