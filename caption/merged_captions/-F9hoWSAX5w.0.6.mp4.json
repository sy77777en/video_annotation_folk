  "merged_caption": "The video captures a wide shot of an outdoor basketball court enclosed by a black chain-link fence, with the gate open. The camera is at eye level, looking straight ahead with a deep focus and large depth of field, and it smoothly moves forward at a slow pace while slightly tilting up initially. The basketball court occupies the center of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground. The court surface is wet, painted green and red with white lines, and has visible puddles scattered across it, indicating recent rain. An orange cone sits near the center of the court. Two basketball hoops are present, one on each side. The fence dominates approximately 80% of the frame's height in the foreground, stretching from the bottom to the upper part of the frame. Bare trees are positioned in the middle ground, occupying the upper part of the frame from the left side to the center right. Tall buildings appear further back in the background, situated towards the upper middle part of the scene, with a taller building visible in the distance and a brick building to the right of the court. The foreground shows brown fallen leaves. The camera maintains a level angle and minimal shaking throughout, providing a direct view of the court and surrounding elements without any noticeable elevation or angle change. The absence of a specific main subject emphasizes the mood and setting rather than any particular object, highlighting the open space and natural elements like trees and the overcast sky. There are no significant shifts in shot size or spatial positioning throughout the video, maintaining a steady perspective on the environment.",

    "Camera": "The video features a camera at eye level, looking straight ahead with a deep focus and large depth of field. The camera smoothly moves forward at a slow pace while slightly tilting up initially, maintaining a level angle and minimal shaking throughout. The focus is on the basketball court and surrounding area.",
    "Subject": "This is a landscape scenery shot. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere, highlighting the open space and natural elements like trees and the overcast sky. The absence of a specific main subject emphasizes the mood and setting rather than any particular object.",
    "Motion": "The video shows a basketball court enclosed by a chain-link fence, with the gate open. The court is wet, indicating recent rain, and there are puddles on the ground. The background features leafless trees, a few buildings, and two basketball hoops. The camera gradually moves forward, getting closer to the open gate.",
    "Scene": "The video shows an outdoor basketball court on an overcast day, viewed from behind a black chain-link fence with an open gate in the center. The court surface is wet, painted green and red with white lines, and has visible puddles. An orange cone sits near the center of the court. Two basketball hoops are present, one on each side. The foreground shows brown fallen leaves. In the background, bare trees line the perimeter of a park area, with a taller building visible in the distance and a brick building to the right of the court.",
    "Spatial": "The video captures a wide shot of an outdoor basketball court enclosed by a chain-link fence. The camera slowly moves forward, offering a dynamic view of the scene. The basketball court occupies the center of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground. The fence dominates approximately 80% of the frame's height in the foreground, stretching from the bottom to the upper part of the frame. Bare trees are positioned in the middle ground, occupying the upper part of the frame from the left side to the center right. Tall buildings appear further back in the background, situated towards the upper middle part of the scene. Puddles are scattered across the court surface in the middle ground. The camera's height is level with the fence, providing a direct view of the court and surrounding elements without any noticeable elevation or angle change. There are no significant shifts in shot size or spatial positioning throughout the video, maintaining a steady perspective on the environment."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
