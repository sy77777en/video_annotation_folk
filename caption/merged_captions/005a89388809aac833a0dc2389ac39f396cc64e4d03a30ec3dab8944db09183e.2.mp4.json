  "merged_caption": "This is a close-up shot with a shallow depth of field, capturing a softly lit bedroom scene. In the bottom-left foreground, a person's out-of-focus shoulder is visible, and in the upper-left corner, an out-of-focus person's chin can be seen. The central focus is on a pair of light-skinned hands in the middle ground, holding a long, thin object sealed in white paper packaging. The camera, positioned from a high, eye-level angle, remains fixed but slightly unsteady, exhibiting slight movement and subtle shaking throughout the shot. In the background, a young girl with a medium skin tone and dark, curly hair styled in two pigtails is positioned in the upper-right of the frame, sitting up in a bed with a dark headboard composed of vertical bars, grey pillows, and a matching grey comforter. She is wearing a long-sleeved pink textured shirt and is initially leaning back against the pillows with her arms crossed. To her right, in the left background, are several stuffed animals, including a white swan-like toy with pink wings and another plush toy wearing a red and white striped sweater. As the scene progresses, the young girl, initially propped up on pillows, sits up and leans forward slightly, moving closer to the center of the frame to look at the object held by the hands in the foreground. The focus remains on the hands holding the object, while the child in the bed remains softly blurred in the background, maintaining the shallow depth of field throughout the shot.",

    "Scene": "From an over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind a character, the scene is set within a softly lit bedroom. A young girl in a pink textured shirt is sitting up in a bed with a dark headboard composed of vertical bars. The bed is dressed with gray pillows and a matching gray comforter. Next to the girl, several stuffed animals are visible, including a white swan-like toy with pink wings and another plush toy wearing a red and white striped sweater. In the middle ground, a pair of hands holds a long, thin, white sealed packet.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
