  "merged_caption": "This is a wide shot of a rural landscape at dusk, framed from an eye-level perspective with a fixed Dutch angle. In the middle ground at the bottom of the frame, a dark wall or fence runs along. The middle ground is occupied by the dark silhouettes of several trees: a tall evergreen is positioned on the left, a large deciduous tree is in the center, and another evergreen and tree cluster are on the right. In the background, the twilight sky fills the majority of the frame. A soft orange glow is visible on the horizon behind the trees, while dark clouds dominate the upper and left portions of the sky. Two bright orange contrails are visible in the top center of the frame. The camera maintains a stationary position while gradually zooming in, enhancing the focus on the scenic sky at either dawn or dusk. It captures the silhouettes of several trees against a backdrop of dark clouds and colorful streaks from the sun. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp, while slowly and smoothly zooming in. The focus is on the atmospheric quality of the environment rather than a specific subject, using the vastness of the sky to create a sense of scale and mood. The scene is dominated by a deep blue-grey sky filled with dark, heavy clouds. Near the horizon, the last light of the setting sun casts a soft orange and pink glow. Two long, thin contrails, brightly illuminated by the sun, streak across the upper portion of the sky in a vibrant orange hue. The camera remains in position while gradually zooming in.",

    "Camera": "This time-lapse video is captured from a low, eye-level perspective with a fixed Dutch angle. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp, while slowly and smoothly zooming in.",
    "Subject": "This is a landscape scenery shot depicting a dramatic twilight sky over a rural setting. The focus is on the atmospheric quality of the environment rather than a specific subject, using the vastness of the sky to create a sense of scale and mood. The scene is dominated by a deep blue-grey sky filled with dark, heavy clouds. Near the horizon, the last light of the setting sun casts a soft orange and pink glow. Two long, thin contrails, brightly illuminated by the sun, streak across the upper portion of the sky in a vibrant orange hue. In the middle ground, the dark silhouettes of several trees, including tall evergreens and a large, leafy deciduous tree, stand in stark contrast against the colorful twilight.",
    "Motion": "The camera maintains a stationary position while gradually zooming in, enhancing the focus on the scenic sky at either dawn or dusk. It captures the silhouettes of several trees against a backdrop of dark clouds and colorful streaks from the sun. Two long, thin clouds, possibly contrails, are brightly lit with an orange glow.",
    "Scene": "From an outdoor perspective, the scene captures a rural or suburban landscape at dusk. The sky transitions from a dark, cloudy blue to a soft orange glow at the horizon. Two long, thin contrails, illuminated by the setting sun, streak across the upper sky with a bright orange hue. In the middleground, several trees, including a large deciduous tree and a couple of conical evergreens, are silhouetted against the twilight sky. A dark fence or wall runs along the bottom of the view.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
