  "merged_caption": "This video presents a scenery shot focused entirely on the surface of the ocean. In a close-up shot, the deep blue, choppy water fills the entire frame from a high-angle perspective, looking down. The undulating waves are visible across the foreground and middle ground, creating a continuous, textured pattern that shifts and ripples throughout the static shot. The static camera is positioned above the water, using a deep focus to keep the entire surface of the water sharp. The deep blue water is covered in small, gentle waves and ripples that move continuously, lending a calm and mesmerizing quality to the scene. A soft, purplish-pink light, likely from a sunrise or sunset just out of frame, reflects off the crests of the waves, creating a subtle contrast with the darker troughs and lending a serene quality to the scene. The water ripples and shifts constantly, with a soft, purplish light reflecting across the waves, suggesting the low light of either dawn or dusk. The view remains focused on the dynamic, undulating surface of the sea.",

    "Subject": "This video presents a natural scenery shot of the open sea. There is no main subject, as the focus is entirely on the vast, textured surface of the water, emphasizing the environment and atmosphere. The deep blue water is covered in a continuous pattern of small, choppy waves that gently rise and fall. A soft, purplish-pink light, likely from a sunrise or sunset just out of frame, reflects off the crests of the waves, creating a subtle contrast with the darker troughs and lending a serene quality to the scene.",
    "Motion": "This video features a static, close-up shot of the ocean's surface. The deep blue water is covered in small, gentle waves and ripples that move continuously. The scene is calm and mesmerizing, with subtle color variations on the water's surface.",
    "Scene": "A vast expanse of deep blue ocean water fills the frame, its surface textured with a continuous pattern of small, choppy waves. The water ripples and shifts constantly, with a soft, purplish light reflecting across the waves, suggesting the low light of either dawn or dusk. The view remains focused on the dynamic, undulating surface of the sea.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
