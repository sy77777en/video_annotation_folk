  "merged_caption": "A close-up shot frames a young, light-skinned man with short, curly brown hair in profile, positioned in the center of the frame as he faces toward the right. He is wearing a dark, possibly black, shirt, and his expression is somber and contemplative as he sits in a dimly lit environment. The scene is set in a vast, desolate landscape at twilight, with a flat, lighter-colored expanse occupying the mid-ground and a dark, sloping hill visible in the background under a deep blue sky. The ground appears dark and sandy, dotted with a few sparse, out-of-focus bushes. The lighting is low and warm-toned, casting the foreground largely in shadow while a faint light catches the distant plain. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, uses a shallow depth of field to focus on the man in the foreground. Throughout the video, the man remains completely still, enhancing the somber and contemplative mood. The camera performs a slow and smooth counterclockwise arc around him, maintaining the focus on his profile while subtly revealing more of the surrounding landscape, including the dark, sloping hill that extends from the top left toward the center and the lighter, flat expanse visible in the lower middle ground.",

    "Subject": "A young, light-skinned man with short, curly brown hair is shown in a close-up profile view, looking toward his own front, which is the right side of the frame. He is wearing a dark, possibly black, shirt. His expression is somber and contemplative as he sits in a dimly lit environment.",
    "Motion": "The man remains completely still throughout the video, his expression somber and contemplative as he sits in a dimly lit environment.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
