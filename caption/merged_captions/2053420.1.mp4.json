  "merged_caption": "The video captures a dynamic road journey, beginning with a wide shot of a highway stretching into the horizon, flanked by lush greenery. The road occupies the lower half of the frame, extending from the foreground to the background, while the vibrant sunset sky fills the upper half. The camera, mounted at the front of a car at hip level, moves quickly and smoothly forward along the road, maintaining a level angle and deep focus. As the vehicle progresses, more cars, including trucks, appear intermittently, enhancing the sense of motion. The scene transitions smoothly as the road narrows, lined with trees that create a corridor-like effect, with road markings and streetlights guiding the viewer's eye. The environment briefly shifts to an enclosed segment under a tunnel illuminated by overhead lights, where a few cars are seen driving ahead. Exiting the tunnel, the camera continues on a road with trees on both sides, and more vehicles are visible. The camera then moves through a more urban area with buildings and streetlights, maintaining a steady forward motion and a driver's perspective throughout. The video shows the camera moving through various types of roads, including those with traffic lights and residential areas, with the sky gradually darkening. The final frames show the camera moving through a tree-lined street and a more densely built area, with the scene becoming increasingly blurred due to the motion. The focus is on the atmosphere and the experience of travel, highlighting the continuous flow of the drive, with occasional random trucking and panning movements and brief pauses, capturing the overall driving experience.",

    "Camera": "The video is a time-lapse with the camera at hip level, maintaining a level angle and deep focus. It is mounted at the front of a car, moving quickly and smoothly forward along the road. There are occasional random trucking and panning movements with brief pauses.",
    "Subject": "The video is a dynamic road scenery shot, capturing the overall driving experience. It begins with an open highway under a wide sky, featuring a sunset with vibrant clouds that emphasize the vastness and openness of the road. As the drive continues, the scene transitions seamlessly from a highway to a tree-lined street within the town, with blurred lights suggesting speed and motion. The focus is on the atmosphere and the experience of travel, highlighting the continuous flow of the drive.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a view of a highway surrounded by trees and a clear sky with a few clouds, as the camera moves forward along the road. As the camera progresses, more vehicles, including trucks and cars, appear on the highway, driving in both directions. The camera continues to move forward, passing through a tunnel illuminated by overhead lights, where a few cars are seen driving ahead. Exiting the tunnel, the camera continues on a road with trees on both sides, and more vehicles are visible. The camera then moves through a more urban area with buildings and streetlights, and continues to follow the road as it curves and straightens. The video shows the camera moving through various types of roads, including those with traffic lights and residential areas, with the sky gradually darkening. The final frames show the camera moving through a tree-lined street and a more densely built area, with the scene becoming increasingly blurred due to the motion.",
    "Scene": "The video captures an outdoor setting transitioning from a highway to a tree-lined road. Initially, the scene features a wide highway with smooth, dark asphalt, bordered by dense greenery on both sides. The sky is clear with a few clouds, suggesting early evening as the sun sets, casting a warm glow. Numerous cars, including a visible truck, are passing by on both sides or being overtaken. The scene transitions to a narrower road enveloped by trees, with blurred motion indicating speed. Streetlights begin to illuminate, hinting at the onset of dusk. The environment briefly shifts to an enclosed segment under a tunnel, but the majority of the scene remains outdoors, with the natural elements of trees and artificial lighting creating a contrasting atmosphere.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
