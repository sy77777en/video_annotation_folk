  "merged_caption": "This is a high-angle full shot of a picnic set arranged on a weathered wooden deck. The camera, from a high, hip-level angle, slowly and smoothly arcs clockwise around the picnic set, maintaining a deep focus to keep the entire arrangement sharp. The picnic set is placed on a dark gray, textured mat with white stitching and occupies the center of the frame in the middle ground. In the center-left, an orange, square container is topped with a white plate, with its separate white, orange-rimmed lid in the bottom center foreground. To its right, in the center-right middle ground, is a rectangular, two-compartment metal lunchbox containing a salad with chicken and peas, cherry tomatoes, and grilled vegetables. A set of cutlery held together by a black elastic band on a gray holder with an orange rim is to the right of the lunchbox, and two small white round containers are to its left. In the bottom right foreground, a smartphone and a small orange ring lie next to the detached lid. The lower legs and feet of a person wearing black leggings, white socks with green stripes, and black sneakers are visible in the top right background, with a slight movement in the person's leg and foot.",

    "Scene": "An outdoor meal is set up on a weathered wooden deck. A dark gray, textured placemat with white stitching is laid out on the planks. Arranged on the mat is a modern lunch set, featuring a rectangular, metal bento box with two compartments containing a salad with chicken and peas, cherry tomatoes, and grilled vegetables. An orange, square container with a separate white lid with an orange rim, two small white circular containers, and a set of cutlery held in an orange and gray holder complete the arrangement.

    "Spatial": "This is a high-angle full shot of a picnic set arranged on a wooden deck. The camera subtly and smoothly arcs clockwise around the picnic set, which is placed on a dark gray mat and occupies the center of the frame in the middle ground.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
