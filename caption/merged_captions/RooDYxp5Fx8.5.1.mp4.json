  "merged_caption": "This video presents a dynamic wide shot of a city street scene in Japan on a bright, sunny day. From a slightly unsteady, handheld, eye-level perspective, the camera moves forward smoothly along the wide sidewalk, which occupies the foreground and middle ground, stretching from the bottom left towards the center. The camera pans slightly to the right, maintaining a deep focus that keeps the entire street scene, from the foreground to the distant mountains, sharp. A white \"SOMPO\" sign stands in the foreground on the far left, next to a grey-tiled building that lines the left side of the frame. A woman with dark hair, wearing a black shirt and blue jeans, is seen in the left-middle ground, walking away from the camera along the sidewalk. The sidewalk, paved with grey and yellow tactile tiles, runs parallel to a multi-lane road with light traffic, including a silver van parked at the curb. The road fills the middle ground on the right. Across the street, other contemporary buildings line the cityscape, with a lush, green mountain visible in the distant background at the center. The upper portion of the frame is filled with a brilliant blue sky and scattered white clouds, adding a natural element to the urban landscape. The scene captures a typical moment of urban life, emphasizing the overall environment and peaceful atmosphere of the city on a sunny day, rather than focusing on any single person or object.",

    "Subject": "This video captures a bright and tranquil cityscape scenery shot from a sidewalk in a Japanese city. The scene unfolds along a wide, paved sidewalk next to a multi-lane road with light traffic, including a silver van parked at the curb. A woman with dark hair, wearing a black shirt and blue jeans, walks away from the camera. The street is lined with modern buildings of varying heights, one of which features a prominent white sign with the \"SOMPO\" logo. In the distance, lush green mountains are visible under a brilliant blue sky filled with scattered white clouds, adding a natural element to the urban landscape. There is no main subject; the camera's static, wide perspective emphasizes the overall environment and peaceful atmosphere of the city on a sunny day, rather than focusing on any single person or object.",
    "Motion": "This is a street-level view of a city in Japan on a bright, sunny day. A woman is walking on the sidewalk and passing by a large sign for \"SOMPO,\" with buildings, traffic, and a distant green hill visible. The scene captures a typical moment of urban life.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a walk along a wide sidewalk in a Japanese city under a clear blue sky with scattered clouds. To the left stands a modern building with a grey-tiled facade, fronted by a white sign with the \"SOMPO\" logo and Japanese text. The sidewalk, paved with grey and yellow tactile tiles, runs parallel to a multi-lane road with moving traffic, including a silver van parked at the curb. Across the street, other contemporary buildings line the cityscape, with a lush, green mountain visible in the distance. A woman wearing a black top and blue jeans walks ahead on the pavement.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
