  "merged_caption": "The video begins by focusing on a stone-like object located in the middle ground on the left, with other blurred stone-like objects visible from the foreground to the middle ground on a reddish-brown table. The camera is positioned at hip level, initially at a high angle, then transitions to a low angle due to camera motion. A dark, out-of-focus silhouette occupies the right side of the middle ground. The camera tilts upward while simultaneously panning to the right, revealing more of the figure in a dark suit with crossed arms, initially out of focus. As the silhouette gradually comes into focus, it reveals a figure positioned on the right, dressed in a dark suit and a lighter-colored collared shirt, with light-colored hair and round glasses. The video employs a shallow depth of field, starting with the focus on the midground and then shifting to the man in the foreground via a rack focus. The shot transitions into a medium shot, framing the figure from the waist up. As the camera continues to move, the figure's upper body and face become clearer, showing light hair, glasses, and a mustache. The camera pans to the right and tilts up at the beginning to focus on the man in black, while slowly moving backward throughout the entire video. When the figure is fully revealed, they are positioned in the center of the foreground. The stone-like objects are no longer visible at this point. The camera is at the same height as the figure. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays the text \"ALBERT REHM\" at the top and \"GERMAN PHILOLOGIST\" at the bottom on a light beige background, which gradually disappears as the figure's face becomes fully visible. The overall atmosphere is somber and shadowy.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at hip level. Initially, it's at a high angle, then transitions to a low angle due to camera motion. The video employs a shallow depth of field, starting with the focus on the midground and then shifting to the man in the foreground via a rack focus. The camera pans to the right and tilts up at the beginning to focus on the man in black, while slowly moving backward throughout the entire video. The camera movement is very smooth.",
    "Subject": "The video begins with a static close-up of several small, stone-like objects on a brown surface. Then, a figure in a dark suit with crossed arms appears in the middle ground, initially out of focus, before gradually coming into sharper focus as the camera moves. Finally, the figure's head and facial features, including light hair, glasses, and a mustache, become visible.",
    "Motion": "The video starts with a close-up of several stone-like objects on a reddish surface, with a label identifying 'Albert Rehm, German Philologist' appearing in the lower left corner. The camera then tilts upward while simultaneously panning to the right, revealing more of the figure in a dark suit with crossed arms, initially out of focus. As the camera continues to move, the figure's upper body and face become clearer, showing light hair, glasses, and a mustache. The label in the lower left corner gradually disappears as the figure's face becomes fully visible.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set in a moderately lit indoor environment. On a reddish-brown table, scattered stones in a mix of teal, white, and reddish-brown are visible. A figure, rendered in a desaturated, almost grayscale palette. The figure is dressed in a dark suit and a lighter-colored collared shirt, with light-colored hair and round glasses. They stand with their arms crossed. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays the text \"ALBERT REHM\" at the top and \"GERMAN PHILOLOGIST\" at the bottom on a light beige background. The bottom right corner of the overlay features a pattern of three quarter-circle arcs. The overall atmosphere is somber and shadowy.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
