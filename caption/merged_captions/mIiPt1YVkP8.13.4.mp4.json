  "merged_caption": "A full shot shows a damaged section of an airplane fuselage positioned in the center of the frame, located in the foreground against a dark, gradient background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level and smoothly arcs clockwise around the 3D model of the broken airplane fuselage, causing it to gradually shift to a profile view within the shot. The fuselage is primarily white, marked with red and blue stripes running horizontally along its length. Near the top, a small Malaysian flag is visible, with an additional Malaysian flag inside the fuselage. The fuselage is severely damaged, with large, jagged sections of its skin torn away, particularly in the upper middle section, revealing the dark, skeletal framework of the plane's internal structure. The entire piece is illuminated by a soft, focused light emanating from the right side of the image, highlighting its tattered form in the otherwise dark space. The shot uses a deep focus, keeping the entire model in sharp detail. Without further context, it is unclear if the camera is moving around the model or if the model itself is rotating.",

Without further context, it is unclear if the camera is moving around the model or if the model itself is rotating. The shot uses a deep focus, keeping the entire model in sharp detail.",
    "Subject": "A damaged section of an airplane fuselage is depicted against a dark, gradient background. The piece is primarily white, with a red and a blue stripe running horizontally along its length. Near the top, a small Malaysian flag is visible, with an additional Malaysian flag inside the fuselage. The fuselage is severely damaged, with the outer skin torn away in large, ragged sections, particularly in the upper middle section. This damage exposes the dark, skeletal framework of the plane's internal structure. The object is illuminated from the right, highlighting its tattered form.",
    "Motion": "The damaged section of the airplane fuselage slowly shifts to a profile view against a dark, gradient background.",
    "Scene": "A damaged section of an airplane fuselage is suspended against a dark, featureless background. The white exterior is marked with red and blue stripes running horizontally, and a small Malaysian flag is visible near the front. The fuselage is severely damaged, with large, jagged sections of its skin torn away, revealing the dark, skeletal frame of the aircraft's interior structure. The entire piece is illuminated by a soft, focused light emanating from the right side of the image in the otherwise dark space.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
