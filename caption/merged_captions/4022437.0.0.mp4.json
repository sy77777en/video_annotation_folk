  "merged_caption": "This is a full, level-angle shot where a black Mercedes-Benz S550 sedan with its doors open is positioned in the center of the frame. The asphalt pavement, marked with white lines, occupies the entire foreground and extends continuously to the background. In the background, several single-story white buildings are visible behind the vehicle, with a tree to the far left and a distant construction crane to the far right. The car remains stationary in a paved asphalt parking lot during the day under a partly cloudy blue sky. The camera smoothly moves backward away from the black Mercedes-Benz S550, which is parked with its doors open, causing the car to recede slightly further into the middle ground and become smaller within the frame, while revealing more of the pavement in the foreground. Midway through the backward movement, the camera performs a slight pan to the left. The car is viewed from a level angle, positioned at the left rear of the vehicle, and features silver, multi-spoke alloy wheels. The light tan or beige interior is visible through the open doors. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp as it moves.",

    "Camera": "From a ground-level, level angle, the shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera smoothly moves backward away from a black Mercedes-Benz S550, which is parked with its doors open. Midway through the backward movement, the camera performs a slight pan to the left.",
    "Subject": "The video shows a black Mercedes-Benz S550 sedan parked in an outdoor paved area marked with white lines. The car is viewed from a level angle, positioned at the left rear of the vehicle. All four of its doors are open, revealing a light tan or beige interior. The car features silver, multi-spoke alloy wheels, and several buildings are visible in the background.",
    "Motion": "The black car remains stationary in a parking lot with all four of its doors open throughout the video.",
    "Scene": "From a level-angle perspective close to the ground, the scene is set in a paved asphalt parking lot during the day under a partly cloudy blue sky. A black sedan with a tan interior is parked with all four of its doors open. In the background, there are several single-story white buildings, a chain-link fence, and a distant construction crane. The camera slowly moves backward across the worn pavement, which is marked with white parking lines, away from the rear three-quarter view of the car.",
    "Spatial": "This is a full, level-angle shot where a black car with its doors open is positioned in the center of the frame. The asphalt pavement, marked with white lines, occupies the entire foreground and extends continuously to the background. In the background, several white buildings are visible behind the vehicle, with a tree to the far left and a construction crane to the far right. The camera slowly pulls backward, causing the car to recede slightly further into the middle ground and become smaller within the frame, while revealing more of the pavement in the foreground."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
