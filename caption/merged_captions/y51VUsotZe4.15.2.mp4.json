  "merged_caption": "The video begins with an extreme wide shot, capturing a red sedan, identifiable by the yellow car topper sign on its roof, in the center middle ground of the frame. The car is positioned on a wide, multi-lane bridge at night, which occupies the bottom portion of the screen, extending from the foreground into the distance. Symmetrical rows of tall, slender streetlights line the left and right sides of the bridge, their warm, orange-yellow glow casting light onto the road and creating leading lines that converge toward the background, where the out-of-focus lights of a city create a soft, blurred backdrop against the black sky. The dark, paved road is marked with a central yellow double line. As the red sedan, with its headlights illuminated, drives steadily forward on the wide, empty bridge, it remains centered in its lane, moving directly toward the camera. The car transitions from the middle ground to the foreground, causing the shot to transition into a wide shot. Initially, the camera starts at a level angle and then tilts downward to achieve a high-angle perspective, looking down on the scene while keeping the car centered. The camera maintains a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp as it tracks the car driving towards it.",

    "Camera": "The video starts with a level angle before tilting down to a high angle, maintaining a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp. The camera tracks the car as it drives towards the camera.",
    "Subject": "A red sedan, identifiable by the yellow car topper sign on its roof, is shown on a wide, multi-lane bridge at night. The car is centered on the road, consistently approaching the viewer with its headlights on. The bridge is defined by two long, symmetrical rows of tall, slender streetlights, one on each side. The lights are illuminated, casting a warm glow onto the road surface and creating a visual corridor that recedes into the darkness.",
    "Motion": "A red sedan with a yellow sign on its roof drives steadily forward on a wide, empty bridge at night. The car remains centered in its lane as it moves directly toward the camera with its headlights illuminated.",
    "Scene": "At night, a single car with its headlights illuminated drives toward the camera on a wide, multi-lane overpass. The dark, paved road is marked with a central yellow double line. Symmetrical rows of tall, slender streetlights line both sides of the overpass, their warm, orange-yellow glow casting light onto the road and creating a receding perspective against the black sky. In the distance, the out-of-focus lights of a city create a soft, blurred backdrop.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
