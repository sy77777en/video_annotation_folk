  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot capturing the entire red brick house positioned slightly left of center in the middle ground. A black metal fence spans the foreground across the bottom of the frame. To the left of the house's arched wooden front door is a large bush with red flowers, and a small blue security sign is staked in the green lawn at the bottom left, near the foreground fence. A white stucco pillar with a black light fixture is fully visible in the right foreground, along with an attached black metal gate. The green lawn stretches between the foreground fence and the middle ground house. An adjacent white house with a red tile roof is visible in the background on the far right. The camera is at eye level, maintaining a level angle and deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping the house and its surroundings sharp. The camera performs two zoom-out movements, with a brief pause in between. The movement is slightly unsteady, exhibiting noticeable shaking. As the camera zooms out, the view gradually reveals more of the house's facade, including additional windows and the surrounding greenery. The black metal fence in the foreground becomes more prominent as the camera continues to zoom out, showing the full extent of the fence and the well-maintained lawn. The adjacent white house with a red tile roof comes into view, indicating the house is part of a residential area. The scene, captured during the daytime under an overcast sky, also reveals a neighboring house with a light-colored stucco exterior and a red tile roof to the right as the view widens slightly.",

    "Subject": "The video begins with a close-up of the front exterior of a large, two-story house built with red bricks, featuring multiple windows with white frames, a dark roof, and an arched wooden front door beneath a black light fixture. As the camera zooms out, it reveals a black metal fence with decorative finials enclosing a green lawn, and a substantial bush with red flowers near the house's entrance. The zoom-out action also includes the right-side fence pillar, a white stucco structure holding a black light fixture, which forms part of a black metal gate. Additionally, the adjacent white house with a red tile roof becomes visible on the far right, along with a small blue security sign staked in the lawn close to the fence.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a wide shot of the front entrance of a brick house, featuring a wooden door under an arched brick canopy, flanked by two windows and a black lantern. As the camera zooms out, the view gradually reveals more of the house's facade, including additional windows and the surrounding greenery.

    "Scene": "The video shows the exterior of a large, two-story red brick house with white-framed windows and a dark shingled roof, set behind a black wrought iron fence with spear-point finials. An arched wooden front door is a central feature of the house. In the foreground, the black wrought iron fence, along with a white stucco pillar featuring a modern black light fixture and a black wrought iron gate that opens onto a paved area, forms part of the property's boundary. In the midground, a well-maintained green lawn and various bushes, including one with red flowers near the entrance, are visible. The scene, captured during the daytime under an overcast sky, also reveals a neighboring house with a light-colored stucco exterior and a red tile roof to the right as the view widens slightly.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
