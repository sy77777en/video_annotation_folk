  "merged_caption": "The video presents a medium close-up shot of a woman with medium skin tone and straight, shoulder-length dark hair, wearing large, polygonal glasses and a teal hoodie. She is centrally positioned in the frame, occupying the foreground, with a calm and slightly smiling expression. Initially, her head is turned towards her right, which corresponds to the left side of the frame, then she gradually turns to face forward, maintaining her central position. The camera is positioned at eye level, capturing her in the foreground with a shallow depth of field, keeping the focus on her while the background remains blurred. The background consists of patterned wallpaper and framed artwork located behind her, with decorative plates visible on the wall, situated in the upper middle and right areas of the frame. The scene is set indoors in a warmly lit room with a cozy, intimate feel, featuring soft lighting that casts gentle shadows. The environment includes decorative plates mounted on the wall, adding a touch of homeliness. The time of day is indeterminate due to the indoor lighting. The camera is static, with no movement or shaking, and there are no noticeable changes in angle or position. The scene remains consistent throughout, with no significant changes in the environment or lighting, and the spatial arrangement of the elements remains static.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
