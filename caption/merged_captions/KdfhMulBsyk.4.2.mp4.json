  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot filmed at the subject's level, a man in a long, dark coat is positioned in the center middle ground, walking steadily towards the camera down a foggy, snow-dusted urban street at night. The camera, positioned at a level angle and hip-height, smoothly moves backward and to the left, leading the man as he walks. In the background on the right, two large, boxy vehicles with bright headlights illuminate the dense, blue-tinted fog and remain stationary. A group of silhouetted figures is clustered in the center-right background, between the man and the vehicles, also walking forward in the same direction. A large, dark building with a row of small lights along its upper walkway occupies the left middle ground, casting a cool, blue-green light over the scene. In the bottom-left foreground, a single bright headlight from a mostly obscured vehicle is visible near the ground, and the rear half of a large vehicle with its tail spotlight can be seen, disappearing from the left side of the frame as the video progresses. The air is thick with mist or falling snow, obscuring details and creating a hazy atmosphere. In the distance, a group of silhouetted figures rides motorcycles alongside the large trucks. A deep focus is employed, keeping both the man in the middle ground and the vehicles in the background relatively sharp.",

    "Subject": "The main subject is a man, seen from the front, walking down a dark, foggy street. He is a silhouette wearing a long, dark coat. In the background, further down the street, are two large, boxy vehicles with bright headlights that illuminate the dense, blue-tinted fog. A small group of silhouetted figures is clustered between the man and the vehicles. On the left side of the scene, a single bright headlight from a mostly obscured vehicle is visible near the ground, and the rear half of a large vehicle with its tail spotlight can also be seen, disappearing from the left side of the frame as the video progresses.",
    "Motion": "A man in a long coat walks steadily towards the camera down a foggy street. In the distance, a small group of people also walks forward in the same direction, while two large vehicles with bright headlights remain stationary in the background.",
    "Scene": "A lone figure in a dark coat walks down a foggy, snow-dusted urban street at night. The scene is cast in a cool, blue-green light, primarily illuminated by the bright headlights of several large, truck-like vehicles on the right and a series of small lights along the upper walkway of a large, dark building on the left. In the distance, a group of silhouetted figures rides motorcycles alongside the large trucks. The air is thick with mist or falling snow, obscuring details and creating a hazy atmosphere.",
    "Spatial": "In a wide shot filmed at the subject's level, a man in a long coat is positioned in the center middle ground, walking away from the camera. In the background on the right, two large vehicles with bright headlights are visible. A group of silhouetted figures is clustered in the center-right background, between the man and the vehicles. A large, dark building with a row of lights occupies the left middle ground. In the bottom-left foreground, a single spotlight from an obscured vehicle is visible."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
