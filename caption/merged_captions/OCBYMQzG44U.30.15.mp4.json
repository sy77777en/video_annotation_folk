  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot of an interior architectural space, featuring mild barrel distortion. Initially, a rough-textured wall dominates the left foreground and middle ground, with a white-tiled walkway extending from the bottom foreground towards an arched doorway in the center background. A dark, tiled area is visible in the bottom right foreground and middle ground. The camera is at eye level and maintains a level angle, utilizing deep focus with a large depth of field. As the viewpoint moves forward, the walkway leads towards the doorway, which remains in the center background but appears closer. The camera gradually moves closer to the doorway, maintaining focus on it. The room's walls are divided, with a lower band of rough, grey-brown textured material and an upper section of white, small square tiles. The floor features an outer edge lined with white tiles, followed by a band of black tiles, and a central rectangular section made of white tiles. The camera then pans to the right, and the initial doorway exits the frame. The frame now shows a large expanse of the room, with the dark tiled floor prominent in the foreground and middle ground, a white tiled section in the center middle ground, and white tiled walls with a grey band below them in the middle ground and background. A large circular ceiling light and smaller recessed lights illuminate the scene, creating a sterile ambiance. The camera completes its pan, fully revealing the room's interior, including another arched doorway at the far end. The intention is to showcase the architectural design, the interplay of light and shadow, and the overall mood of the space, emphasizing its scale and minimalist aesthetic rather than a particular focal point.",

    "Camera": "The video features mild barrel distortion. The camera is at eye level and maintains a level angle, utilizing deep focus with a large depth of field. This first-person camera moves forward while rapidly panning from left to right to examine the room, with very smooth movement.",
    "Subject": "This video presents an interior architectural scenery shot, focusing on the environment and atmosphere of a stark, modern space.The camera reveals a room where white ceramic tiles line the floor and the lower portion of the walls, creating a contrast with the rough gray-textured surface above. There is a rectangular area on the floor outlined with dark tiles, where reflections are clearly visible. An arched doorway with a dark interior stands at the far end. The scene is illuminated by a large circular ceiling light and smaller spotlights, creating a sterile ambiance. There is no main subject, as the intention is to showcase the architectural design, the interplay of light and shadow, and the overall mood of the space, emphasizing its scale and minimalist aesthetic rather than a particular focal point.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a view of a tiled room with a small arched doorway at the far end, illuminated by a ceiling light. The camera gradually moves closer to the doorway, maintaining focus on it. As the camera continues to move, it starts to pan to the right, revealing more of the room. The room features a floor with a white outer border, a central black-tiled band, and a smaller white rectangle at the center. The walls are a mix of white and gray tiles. The camera completes its pan, fully revealing the room's interior, including another arched doorway at the far end.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, reveals a large, brightly lit indoor space as the viewpoint moves forward and then pans to the right. The room's walls are divided, with a lower band of rough, grey-brown textured material and an upper section of white, small square tiles. The floor features an outer edge lined with white tiles, followed by a band of black tiles, and a central rectangular section made of white tiles. A white ceiling features a large, circular light fixture and smaller recessed lights. At the far end, an arched doorway with a dark interior is visible.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
