  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot, framing a smiling woman on the left and a smiling man in the center-right, both positioned in the foreground. The woman has long, light-colored hair partially covered by a striped grey, white, and brown headscarf and is wearing a long-sleeved coat or dress with a shiny, yellow and brown snakeskin pattern. The man has dark, shoulder-length hair and is dressed in 18th-century-style clothing, including a dark green velvet frock coat and a large, ruffled white cravat. A vintage car is partially visible on the far right, with a stone wall on the left and a large, dark red garage door forming the background. The scene is set at night in a dimly lit driveway or garage, flanked by walls constructed from light-colored stone blocks. The space is sparsely illuminated by warm lights from the wall sconces, with some sources not visible. As the figures walk together toward the right and slightly toward the camera, the woman moves to the passenger side of the dark-colored convertible and gets into the car. The man then walks around the rear of the vehicle to the driver's side and opens the door. The camera simultaneously tracks rightward and moves backward, transitioning into a full shot that reveals the entire car now positioned in the foreground. The car has a classic design with large, round headlights and a chrome grille. The woman continues moving on the left side of the frame, getting into the car's passenger seat, while the man shifts from the center-left to the center-right of the frame, positioning himself by the driver's door. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the shot, maintaining a deep focus to keep the characters and their surroundings clear.",

    "Camera": "This is a smooth, eye-level shot that leads a man and a woman from the front as they walk toward a vintage car. The camera moves backward while trucking to the right, executing a slight downward tilt as the woman gets into the car. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the characters and their surroundings clear.",
    "Subject": "A smiling woman and a man stand next to a vintage car in a dimly lit setting. The woman has long, light-colored hair partially covered by a striped grey, white, and brown headscarf. She is wearing a long-sleeved coat or dress with a shiny, yellow and brown snakeskin pattern. The man, who is also smiling, has dark, shoulder-length hair and is dressed in 18th-century-style clothing, including a dark green velvet frock coat and a large, ruffled white cravat. The woman walks to the passenger side of the dark-colored convertible and gets in, while the man walks to the other side of the vehicle and opens the door. The car has large, round headlights and a prominent front grille.",

    "Scene": "The scene is set at night in a dimly lit driveway or garage, flanked by walls constructed from light-colored stone blocks. A large, dark red garage door serves as the background. The space is sparsely illuminated by warm lights from the wall sconces, with some sources not visible. A dark, vintage convertible is parked in the driveway. The car has a classic design with large, round headlights and a chrome grille. Two figures approach the car; one enters the passenger side while the other opens the driver's door.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
