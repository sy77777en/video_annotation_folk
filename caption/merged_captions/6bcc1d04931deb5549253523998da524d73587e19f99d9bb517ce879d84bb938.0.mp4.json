  "merged_caption": "This is a medium to close-up, high-angle shot captured in slow motion from a high, eye-level angle. Initially, a dark-skinned hand, extending from the cuff of a white, long-sleeved shirt, is positioned in the bottom-left foreground, operating a black smartphone's calculator application resting on a light-colored wooden table. The phone's screen displays a calculator application featuring white numerals on dark gray circular buttons and orange circular operational buttons, with the calculated result shown on its display changing. The large white architectural blueprints, detailed with black and gray technical drawings, dimensions, and featuring the visible text \"Structures Education,\" serve as the middle ground, spread across the entire frame. A wooden pencil rests in the middle-left, and a portion of a white rolled-up paper or blueprint tube with a black end is visible in the bottom-right foreground. The hand taps on the smartphone's calculator application, changing the number on the display. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, focusing on the person's hands in the foreground and the architectural blueprint in the middle ground. From this near bird’s-eye view, the camera slowly and smoothly arcs counterclockwise around the blueprint on the table. The hand then moves to the middle-left to pick up the light brown wooden pencil, holding it between the fingers, and makes a mark on a section of the architectural blueprints laid out on the table. Finally, the hand, holding the pencil, moves across the center-left area of the frame, making a mark on the drawing. The person's torso remains partially visible at the top-left edge throughout the shot.",

    "Subject": "A dark-skinned hand, extending from the cuff of a white, long-sleeved shirt, interacts with a black smartphone resting on a light-colored wooden table. The phone's screen displays a calculator application featuring white numerals on dark gray circular buttons and orange circular operational buttons, with the calculated result shown on its display changing. The hand then picks up a light brown wooden pencil and proceeds to write or make notations on large white architectural blueprints, which are detailed with black and gray technical drawings, dimensions, and feature the visible text \"Structures Education.\" A portion of a white rolled-up paper or blueprint tube with a black end is also visible in the lower right.",

    "Scene": "From an eye-level perspective above the subject, a large architectural blueprint with black-lined diagrams and measurements is spread across a light-colored wooden desk. A person wearing a white shirt uses a calculator app on a black smartphone that is resting on the paper. After performing a calculation, they pick up a nearby wooden pencil and mark a section of the drawing. A rolled-up white paper is also visible on the desk.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
