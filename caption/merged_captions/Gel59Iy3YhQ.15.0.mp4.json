  "merged_caption": "This is a wide, high-angle shot of a video game level featuring two cartoonish chef characters wearing classic white chef hats; one is dressed in red, positioned on a platform in the top right, while the other in blue is on a platform in the bottom center. The main gameplay area, consisting of several stone-tiled kitchen platforms with red trim, occupies the middle ground of the frame, surrounded by dark purple water filled with bright green lily pads. The scene is illuminated by glowing red, square-shaped lanterns scattered around the platforms, creating a whimsical ambiance. In the lower right foreground, dark silhouettes of trees are visible. Overlaid on the screen are recipe cards at the top, a score in the bottom left, and a timer in the bottom right. During the clip, the blue-shirted chef remains in the bottom right kitchen, placing chopped ingredients onto a plate, while the red-shirted chef picks up a blue ingredient and moves left, crossing a lotus leaf area to reach the top left kitchen. The camera uses a deep focus, ensuring the entire game level is clear and sharp, and is mostly static, exhibiting only minor, smooth, and unintentional movements.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
