  "merged_caption": "In a close-up shot, a light-skinned woman's face occupies the right-center portion of the frame in the middle ground. Her head is tilted, resting on a soft, textured surface that extends across the bottom of the frame, with the left side showing her upper body and the far right side revealing part of the ground. The scene flickers between light and darkness, resembling a lightning storm, in a nearly black environment with a strong blue light creating a dark, monochromatic blue color scheme. Her face is partially illuminated, and she looks upward with wide, dark eyes, her expression tense with a slight frown and her mouth slightly open. Her dark hair is partially visible around her face. The woman's face remains completely still throughout the video, with no discernible movement. The camera, positioned at her height from a ground-level, level angle, slowly and smoothly zooms in on her face, maintaining a shallow depth of field that keeps the focus fixed on her face in the midground as she looks straight ahead at the camera.",

    "Camera": "From a ground-level, level angle, the camera slowly and smoothly zooms in on a person's face. A shallow depth of field keeps the focus fixed on the face in the midground.",
    "Subject": "In a very dark, blue-lit scene, the face of a light-skinned woman is shown in a close-up. Her head is tilted, resting on a surface, and she looks upward with wide, dark eyes. Her expression is tense, with a slight frown and her mouth slightly open. Her hair is dark and partially visible around her face.",
    "Motion": "The woman's face remains completely still throughout the video, with no discernible movement.",
    "Scene": "In a nearly black environment, a person's face is partially illuminated by a strong blue light, creating an atmosphere reminiscent of a lightning storm with alternating light and darkness. The individual is lying on a soft, textured surface that is mostly obscured by shadow, and the scene is characterized by its dark, monochromatic blue color scheme.",
    "Spatial": "In a close-up shot, a woman's face occupies the right-center portion of the frame in the middle ground. Her head is tilted, resting on a surface that extends across the bottom of the frame, with the left side showing her upper body and the far right side revealing part of the ground. The scene flickers between light and darkness, resembling a lightning storm. The camera, slightly and slowly zooming in, is positioned at her height, capturing her as she looks straight ahead at the camera."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
