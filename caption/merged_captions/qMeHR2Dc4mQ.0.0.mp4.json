  "merged_caption": "This close-up shot frames a Black man primarily in the center of the screen, occupying the foreground against a dark background. The video shows a close-up profile view of his head and shoulders, with short, dark hair and a shirt. The lighting is dim, illuminating only the left side of his face and head, leaving the right side mostly in shadow. His mouth is slightly open, and he is consistently facing the left side of the frame. The background and middleground are entirely dark and indistinct, suggesting a nighttime setting or a space completely lacking light. The camera maintains a position level with the subject, smoothly tracking the man by moving left. As he runs, his head and shoulders move up and down in sync with his body, causing slight vertical motion, yet his position remains fixed in the center of the frame. His hands occasionally enter the frame in the bottom foreground. The video is captured in slow motion, enhancing the perception of his movement. The pervasive darkness renders the focus indeterminable, and the man appears mostly as a silhouette against the indistinguishable surroundings.",

    "Camera": "This slow-motion video is captured from an eye-level, level angle. Due to the dim lighting and black background, the focus is indeterminable. The camera smoothly tracks the man by moving left.",
    "Subject": "The video shows a close-up profile view of a Black man's head and shoulders against a dark background. He has short, dark hair and is wearing a shirt. The lighting is dim, illuminating only the left side of his face and head, leaving the right side mostly in shadow. His mouth is slightly open, and he is facing the left side of the frame, appearing to be running.",
    "Motion": "The video shows a close-up profile view of a Black man's head and shoulders against a dark background. He has short, dark hair and is wearing a shirt. The lighting is dim, illuminating only the left side of his face and head, leaving the right side mostly in shadow. His mouth is slightly open, and he is looking towards the left side of the frame while running, with his head and shoulders moving up and down in sync with his body.",
    "Scene": "The video is set in an extremely dark environment where the surroundings are indistinguishable. It appears to be nighttime or within a space completely lacking light. A close-up shot prominently features a Black man in profile, who is running. At times, his hands briefly enter the frame. He is heavily shadowed and appears mostly as a silhouette against the pervasive darkness. No other details of the location are discernible.",
    "Spatial": "This close-up shot frames a man primarily in the center of the screen, occupying the foreground. Both the background and the middleground are entirely dark and indistinct. The camera maintains a position level with the subject. While the man is running, causing slight vertical motion, his position remains fixed in the center of the frame, consistently facing left. His hands occasionally enter the frame in the bottom foreground."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
