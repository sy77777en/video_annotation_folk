  "merged_caption": "From a high-angle, point-of-view perspective, a full shot captures two light-skinned women in mid-air as they jump from a dark, jagged rock formation. The woman holding the camera, who has long, blonde hair and is wearing a black bikini top, is in the foreground, positioned in the bottom right of the frame. She is holding hands with a second woman, who has long, brown hair and is wearing a patterned bikini with red, black, and white designs. This second woman is slightly ahead in the middle ground, just to the left of the frame's center. Both women are moving downwards, their hair flying out as they leap towards the deep, greenish-blue water below. The water fills the middle ground and background on the left and bottom of the frame, while white surf crashes against the rocky coastline visible in the background at the top left. The slightly unsteady camera, held by the woman with blonde hair, tracks their descent from an overhead height, moving down and to the left, following their fall toward the water. The shot exhibits mild barrel distortion and maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",

    "Camera": "From a high angle, the slightly unsteady camera tracks two women as they jump from a cliff. The camera moves down and to the left, following their descent from an overhead height toward the water. The shot exhibits mild barrel distortion and maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "The video, shot from a selfie perspective, shows two light-skinned women jumping off a rocky cliff. The woman holding the camera has long, blonde hair and is wearing a black bikini top. She is holding hands with another woman who is further away from the camera and to her right. This second woman has long, brown hair and is wearing a patterned bikini with red, black, and white designs. Both women are in mid-air, their hair flying out as they leap towards the water.",
    "Motion": "From a selfie perspective, a woman holding a camera and another woman run together while holding hands. They leap from a rocky cliff, and the video captures them in mid-air as they fall toward the water below, their hair flying upward from the motion.",
    "Scene": "From a selfie point of view, the camera, held by one of two women, captures them in mid-air as they jump from a dark, jagged rock formation. They are holding hands as they descend towards the deep, greenish-blue water below. In the background, white surf crashes against the rocky coastline under daylight.",
    "Spatial": "From a high-angle, point-of-view perspective, a full shot captures two women in mid-air. The woman holding the camera is in the foreground, positioned in the bottom right of the frame. She is holding hands with a second woman who is slightly ahead in the middle ground, just to the left of the frame's center. Both are moving downwards from a dark rock formation that occupies the middle ground on the right and top. The water below them fills the middle ground and background on the left and bottom of the frame, while white surf against a rocky coastline is visible in the background at the top left."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
