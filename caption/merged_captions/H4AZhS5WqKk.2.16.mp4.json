  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot featuring Tom the cat hanging from a golden chandelier, positioned prominently in the foreground. Jerry the mouse stands above him on the chandelier, also in the foreground. The background includes a window in the top left, striped armchairs extending from the bottom left towards the center, a round table in the center, and a wall lamp in the top right. The camera is positioned at an overhead level, initially at a low angle looking up at Tom and Jerry on the chandelier, and is also at the same height as the chandelier, Tom, and Jerry. It then slightly cranes up, transitioning to a high-angle view looking down at them, and subsequently remains static. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the focus on Tom and Jerry in the foreground. As Tom swings, his head and hands are initially visible at the bottom of the frame, while Jerry's full body is in view. The shot size varies, sometimes showing Tom's entire body and other times just his head, while Jerry is mostly depicted in full. In the next sequence, Jerry is positioned above Tom as they appear to fall from the center towards the bottom of the frame. However, Tom becomes stuck in the chandelier, while Jerry stands on the edge of a light bulb, closer to the camera. The chandelier shifts towards the top of the frame, and the shot continues to track the characters, maintaining a medium shot. The room is a cozy living room setting, warmly lit for evening or nighttime, with a striking, gold-colored metal chandelier with multiple lit bulbs encased in cylindrical glass shades taking center stage. The playful chase results in the chandelier flickering and eventually going out, as if experiencing a short-circuit or loose connection.",

    "Subject": "The video features the iconic animated characters, Tom and Jerry. In this scene, Tom, a blue-gray cat with a white muzzle, white paws, yellow eyes with black pupils, and pink inner ears, is seen hanging from a golden chandelier with both paws. Jerry, a small brown mouse with a lighter brown belly, large eyes, and pink inner ears, stands on the chandelier above Tom. Tom is making a determined effort to catch Jerry, and they both remain on the chandelier at the conclusion of the video.",
    "Motion": "In a well-lit room with modern decor, a blue-gray cat named Tom with white paws and yellow eyes reaches up towards a chandelier where a small brown mouse named Jerry is perched. Tom stretches his neck and paws towards Jerry, who remains elusive on the chandelier. Despite Tom's frantic efforts and constant movement, the chandelier appears to short-circuit or malfunction, yet both Tom and Jerry remain on it. Tom ends up stuck inside the chandelier, while Jerry stands confidently on the edge of one of the light bulbs. In the end, neither of them actually falls, with Jerry still positioned above Tom.",
    "Scene": "The video captures a cozy living room setting, warmly lit for evening or nighttime. A striking, gold-colored metal chandelier with multiple lit bulbs encased in cylindrical glass shades takes center stage. The room features light-colored walls, a window revealing the dark night outside, and a light-colored floor. Furnishings include stylish black and white striped armchairs and a round table with a light-colored surface. Modern, geometric wall-mounted lamps add to the ambient lighting. In a lively scene, animated characters Tom and Jerry are interacting with the chandelier. Tom is trying to catch Jerry, causing the chandelier to sway continuously. This playful chase results in the chandelier flickering and eventually going out, as if experiencing a short-circuit or loose connection.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
