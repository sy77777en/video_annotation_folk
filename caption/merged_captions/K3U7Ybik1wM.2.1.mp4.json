  "merged_caption": "This is a close-up scenery shot of a meadow, capturing a serene outdoor setting filled with vibrant yellow flowers, likely buttercups, in a lush green meadow. The camera is positioned at ground level, capturing the field from a high angle with a fixed Dutch tilt. Initially, the focus is on the yellow flowers in the middle ground, which are spread across the entire frame, with the flowers in the foreground appearing as large, soft yellow blurs. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, and the gentle sway of the flowers suggests a light breeze, contributing to the tranquil, natural ambiance. The scene is set during the day, with natural light illuminating the landscape, and the meadow stretches into the distance, creating a sense of vastness and tranquility. As the shot progresses, the camera performs a rack focus, smoothly shifting to bring the flowers in the foreground into sharp detail, while the flowers closest to the camera, as well as the middle ground and background, remain completely blurred, creating an aesthetic bokeh effect with hues from the yellow flowers and rich green grass. The camera tilts down slightly with some minor shaking, enhancing the soft, dreamlike quality that emphasizes the collective beauty of the scene rather than singling out any particular flower or element. Towards the end, the focus transitions to a single flower in the foreground, while the midground and background become out of focus, further contributing to the peaceful and natural setting.",

    "Subject": "The video presents a nature scenery shot, specifically a close-up view of a vibrant green meadow dotted with numerous small, bright yellow buttercups and a few tiny white flowers. There is no main subject because the focus is on the overall environment and atmosphere of the flower-filled field, with the camera's shallow depth of field and shifting focus creating a soft, dreamlike quality that emphasizes the collective beauty of the scene rather than singling out any particular flower or element. The gentle sway of the flowers suggests a light breeze, further contributing to the tranquil, natural ambiance.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenic close-up shot of a field of small yellow wildflowers, likely buttercups, in a lush green meadow. The camera's focus shifts, creating a soft, blurry effect on different parts of the field.",
    "Scene": "The video captures a serene outdoor setting in a lush meadow filled with vibrant yellow flowers. The scene is set during the day, with natural light illuminating the landscape. The meadow stretches into the distance, creating a sense of vastness and tranquility. Initially, the midground is in focus, showcasing many yellow flowers. Towards the end, the focus transitions to a single flower in the foreground, while the midground and background become out of focus, creating an aesthetic bokeh effect with hues from the yellow flowers and rich green grass. The setting is natural and peaceful.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
