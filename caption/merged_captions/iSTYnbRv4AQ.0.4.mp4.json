  "merged_caption": "This video captures a wide scenery shot from an eye-level perspective, presenting a dynamic cityscape scenery shot taken at night. The composition features a dynamic camera movement that initially follows the street, pans left at an intersection, and then continues forward. The camera moves forward quickly through a city street at night, characterized by significant motion blur that streaks the lights from buildings and street lamps, creating an energetic and slightly disorienting effect. As the camera pans left, a large, light-colored vehicle, possibly a tour bus, quickly passes from left to right in the middle ground, its form elongated and distorted by the camera's movement. The street is visible in the center, flanked by multi-story, historic-style buildings on both sides, extending from the foreground to the background. Their windows and storefronts glow with warm light, and the fast movement of the camera blurs the surroundings, stretching light sources into long horizontal streaks across the frame. After the camera turns left, additional multi-story European-style buildings appear near the center in the background, with buildings still present on both sides, extending from the foreground to the middle ground. The street and sidewalk fill the foreground and middle ground, with blurred figures visible on the street. The pavement reflects the ambient illumination from streetlights and shops, while indistinct figures of people occupy the sidewalks. The primary dynamic is the camera's motion, which streaks all light sources and blurs the scene's elements into horizontal lines. There is no main subject, as the intentional blur and rapid motion shift the focus to the overall atmosphere and kinetic energy of the urban environment rather than any specific person or object.",

    "Camera": "This time-lapse video is captured from a slightly unsteady, eye-level perspective with a deep focus. The camera moves forward quickly through a city street at night, then pans left before continuing its forward motion.",
    "Subject": "This video is a dynamic cityscape scenery shot taken at night. The scene is characterized by a significant motion blur that streaks the lights from buildings and street lamps, creating an energetic and slightly disorienting effect. In the background, multi-story European-style buildings with illuminated windows line a street, while a large, light-colored vehicle, possibly a tour bus, moves through the center of the frame, its form elongated and distorted by the camera's movement. There is no main subject, as the intentional blur and rapid motion shift the focus to the overall atmosphere and kinetic energy of the urban environment rather than any specific person or object.",
    "Motion": "This is a nighttime scene of an illuminated city street lined with historic-looking buildings. The shot is characterized by significant motion blur, causing the lights from buildings, street lamps, and a passing vehicle to streak across the frame.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a rapid, motion-blurred view of a city street at night. The scene is set in a square lined with multi-story, historic-style buildings, their windows and storefronts glowing with warm light. The fast movement of the camera blurs the surroundings, stretching light sources into long horizontal streaks across the frame. A large white bus is visible in the center, its form and lights distorted by the motion. The pavement reflects the ambient illumination from streetlights and shops, while indistinct figures of people occupy the sidewalks.",
    "Spatial": "This video captures a wide scenery shot from an eye-level perspective. The composition features a dynamic camera movement that initially follows the street, pans left at an intersection, and then continues forward. As the camera pans left, a bus quickly passes from left to right in the middle ground, creating a sense of motion. The street is visible in the center, flanked by multi-story buildings on both sides, extending from the foreground to the background. After the camera turns left, additional multi-story buildings appear near the center in the background, with buildings still present on both sides, extending from the foreground to the middle ground. The street and sidewalk fill the foreground and middle ground, with blurred figures visible on the street. The primary dynamic is the camera's motion, which streaks all light sources and blurs the scene's elements into horizontal lines."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
