  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a cylindrical nesting doll, predominantly white with blue and green floral patterns, positioned in the lower left corner of the frame, lying on its side in a minimalistic indoor setting with a plain white background. The camera is shot at a level angle with an ultra shallow depth of field, initially focusing on the foreground object, a fallen Russian nesting doll. As the video progresses, the nesting doll starts rolling forward to the left, revealing more of its intricate design, including orange and white details. As it continues to roll, the doll's patterns become more visible, showing a mix of blue, white, and orange colors. The focus transitions to out of focus as the subject moves. The nesting doll exits the frame from the lower left corner, and this transition shifts to a wide shot, revealing a smaller blue and white floral-patterned cylindrical nesting doll lying on its side near the bottom center edge of the frame. The smaller nesting doll then rolls to the left, positioned in the middle ground. The background remains a plain white throughout, providing a consistent backdrop. The camera remains completely static throughout, maintaining the same height as the subjects.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
