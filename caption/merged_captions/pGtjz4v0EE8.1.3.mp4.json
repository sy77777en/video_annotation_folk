  "merged_caption": "The video employs an extreme wide shot from a high-angle, elevated perspective, with a subtle zooming in and out effect during the transitions between day and night. The octagonal Florence Baptistery, constructed with distinctive white and green marble in horizontal bands and featuring arched windows and a domed roof, is the central element, positioned in the middle ground of the frame. To its left and extending towards the top left, a portion of the larger Florence Cathedral (Duomo) and its bell tower are visible, showcasing similar white and green marble, a prominent rose window, and part of its bell tower, appearing more in the background. The paved square surrounds the Baptistery, occupying the foreground and extending into the middle ground, primarily visible in the bottom and center-right portions of the frame, where numerous people are seen moving during daylight, transitioning to blurred light streaks at night. Multi-story buildings of varying architectural styles, predominantly in shades of yellow and beige with numerous windows, are positioned on the right side of the frame and also form the background behind the main structures, existing in both the middle ground and background. The video begins with a view of a large, ornate building with a dome and arched windows, surrounded by a busy square filled with people walking and gathering. As the video progresses, the lighting changes from daylight to dusk, and the building and square become illuminated by artificial lights. The scene transitions to nighttime, with the building and square brightly lit, and people continuing to move around. The video then returns to daylight, showing the building and square as they were initially, with people still present in the square. The video exhibits barrel distortion, adding a unique visual effect to the scene.",

    "Camera": "This time-lapse video, shot from a aerial high angle, exhibits noticeable barrel distortion. The camera maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field throughout. The very smooth camera movement consists of an initial zoom in, followed by a zoom out at the end.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a cityscape scenery shot from an elevated perspective, capturing a historic European square as it transitions from bright daylight to illuminated night and back to daylight, highlighting the full cycle of the day. The focus is not on a singular subject but rather on the grand architectural ensemble and the evolving atmosphere of the urban space, emphasizing the scale and timelessness of the structures. Central to the view is an octagonal baptistery, distinguished by its white and green marble striped facade, arched windows, and pyramidal roof, standing adjacent to a partially visible, elaborately decorated cathedral with a prominent bell tower. The paved square below teems with people during the day, their movements transforming into blurred streaks under the artificial glow of streetlights and building illuminations at night, conveying a sense of continuous activity against the backdrop of enduring historical architecture.",

    "Scene": "The video presents a high-angle view of a bustling European city square, identified as Piazza del Duomo in Florence, Italy, transitioning from bright daylight to illuminated night and then back to daylight. Dominating the center is the octagonal Florence Baptistery, constructed with distinctive white and green marble in horizontal bands and featuring arched windows and a domed roof. To the left, a portion of the larger Florence Cathedral (Duomo) is visible, showcasing similar white and green marble, a prominent rose window, and part of its bell tower. The square is paved and surrounded by multi-story buildings of varying architectural styles, predominantly in shades of yellow and beige, with numerous windows. During the day, many people are seen walking around the square. As the scene shifts to night, the buildings and the Baptistery are illuminated by artificial lights, and the movement of people becomes blurred streaks, indicating a time-lapse effect. The sky changes from clear blue to dark and then back to daylight, with streetlights and building lights creating a warm glow in the urban environment.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
