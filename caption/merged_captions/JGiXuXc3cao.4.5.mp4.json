  "merged_caption": "The video opens with an extreme wide shot from a high-angle perspective. A small, cylindrical, metallic-looking probe hangs in the top center of the frame in the middle ground, suspended from a thin cable that extends off-screen. The probe casts two wide, translucent beams of light downward, illuminating the textured, grey ground. A dark strip remains unlit directly beneath the probe, while the light reveals the terrain on either side. The textured ground surface extends from the foreground to the background, with a small, dark gray, irregularly shaped rock with a lumpy texture positioned on the left. The camera starts by moving to the left while simultaneously panning to the right, creating a dynamic and engaging shot. During this movement, the probe shifts toward the right side of the frame and eventually moves out of view, but its light beams remain visible. The perspective slowly moves closer to the ground, focusing on the rock as the light beams sweep across the surface. The camera then transitions to a high angle as it moves forward and downward, closing in on the small rock-like object on the dark, textured ground. The rock transitions from the left to the center of the frame. The shot resolves into a high-angle wide shot, with the rock now centered in the middle ground. The entire scene is captured in a smooth, computer-generated shot with a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp. The top of the rock displays varying colors due to the reflection caused by the light exposure. The probe remains stationary, while the light emitted from it moves as if scanning the ground.",

    "Motion": "The camera focuses on a small, dark gray rock resting on a textured surface. A probe suspended from a cable above remains stationary, while the light emitted from it moves as if scanning the ground.",
    "Scene": "A small, cylindrical probe hangs suspended by a thin cable from an unseen point above.

A probe hangs in the top center of the frame in the middle ground, suspended from a cable that extends off-screen. The textured ground surface extends from the foreground to the background, with a small rock positioned on the left. The camera then pans right while moving left and tilts down, moving closer to the ground. During this movement, the probe shifts toward the right side of the frame and eventually moves out of view, but its light beams remain visible. The rock transitions from the left to the center of the frame. The shot resolves into a high-angle wide shot, with the rock now centered in the middle ground."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
