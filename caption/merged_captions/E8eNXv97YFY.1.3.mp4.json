  "merged_caption": "In a level-angle wide shot, the deck of a ferry occupies the lower half of the frame, filled with vehicles and people. A dark green SUV with a spare tire mounted on its rear is on the left, while both a silver car and a black SUV are positioned in the center. A portion of a white car is visible in the lower-left foreground, and a motorcycle is positioned in the space between the green, silver, and black vehicles. The people, mostly men of various ages with light to medium brown skin, are dressed in casual attire such as T-shirts and collared shirts. They are scattered around and between these vehicles in the foreground and middle ground, some standing and others sitting. The ferry is moving forward across a body of water that extends from the immediate foreground to the background, creating a churning wake. In the distant background, a city skyline stretches across the horizontal center of the frame, silhouetted against a dramatic sunset sky filled with dark, heavy clouds and glowing with orange and yellow light from the setting sun. The primary movement is the ferry traveling forward, causing the water to rush past the sides of the vessel. This time-lapse video, shot from an overhead level, level angle perspective, captures the journey from the ferry deck to the distant city skyline with deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. Mounted on the ferry, the camera moves smoothly forward, tracking the journey from behind the cars and passengers, with the time-lapse effect resulting in slight, rapid panning movements as the ferry navigates the choppy water, which reflects the evening light.",

    "Subject": "A group of people and several vehicles are gathered on the deck of a ferry. The vehicles include a dark green SUV on the left with a spare tire mounted on its rear, a silver car in the center, and a black SUV on the right. A portion of a white car is visible in the lower-left foreground, and a motorcycle is positioned in the space between the green, silver, and black vehicles. The people, mostly men of various ages with light to medium brown skin, are dressed in casual attire such as T-shirts and collared shirts. They are positioned around and on top of the vehicles, some standing and others sitting.",
    "Motion": "From a viewpoint at the rear of a ferry, the vessel moves forward across the water, creating a churning wake. On the deck, several cars are parked with passengers standing and sitting around them, all moving along with the boat. In the distance, a city skyline at sunset moves across the frame as the ferry progresses on its journey.",
    "Scene": "From the deck of a moving ferry, the scene captures a crossing over a wide body of water during a dramatic sunset. The sky is filled with dark, heavy clouds, while the horizon glows with orange and yellow light from the setting sun. In the distance, a city skyline is silhouetted against the colorful sky. The ferry's deck is crowded with vehicles, including a dark green SUV and a black SUV, parked alongside motorcycles. Numerous passengers are visible among the vehicles, standing and sitting as the ferry moves through the choppy water, which reflects the evening light.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
