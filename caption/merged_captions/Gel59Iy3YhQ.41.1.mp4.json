  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a young person with light skin and a light-colored ponytail, wearing black-framed glasses, a purple long-sleeved shirt under an orange safety vest, and dark-colored pants, positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. They are holding a light blue umbrella over their head and looking down at a book, which they hold with both hands. The scene is set at the entrance to Odin Finch National Park, indicated by a large, dark wooden sign with white lettering mounted on a wall of large, grey, rounded stones in the upper center of the frame. To the left of the main sign is a smaller emblem for the Department of the Interior, positioned in the upper left corner. The background includes indistinct white shapes visible in the distance behind the sign. The video is shot from a level, eye-level perspective, framed as if viewed through a camera within a game. Initially, the scene is out of focus but sharpens as the camera performs a quick, smooth zoom-out, transitioning to a medium-full shot, revealing the person standing before the sign for \"ODIN FINCH NATIONAL PARK.\" Throughout the video, the person nods their head while reading in front of the sign. The entire scene is presented with a vintage, sepia-toned filter and framed with rounded corners, resembling an old film projection. Yellow text at the bottom center of the screen reads, \"I will never forget this weekend, Dad.\" Additional overlay elements include numerical scales along the right and bottom edges of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, capturing the scene's temporal evolution and spatial relationships.",

    "Scene": "An outdoor scene is set at the entrance to Odin Finch National Park, indicated by a large, dark wooden sign with white lettering mounted on a wall of large, grey, rounded stones. To the left of the main sign is a smaller emblem for the Department of the Interior. A person wearing glasses stands in front of the main sign under a light blue umbrella, looking down at a book.

    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium shot of a person positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. As the camera zooms out, it transitions to a medium-full shot. In the middle ground, a large wooden sign is located in the upper center, mounted on a stone wall.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
