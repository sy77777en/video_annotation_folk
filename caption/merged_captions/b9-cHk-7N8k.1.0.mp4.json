  "merged_caption": "This video begins with a wide shot from a camera positioned at the subject's level, capturing a first-person POV as if through the character’s eyes. In the foreground, the front portion of a second jet ski, featuring white and yellow-green coloring, is visible at the bottom of the frame, moving forward through a calm, dark green body of water. A person with light brown hair, wearing orange and black clothing, rides a white and green jet ski located in the middle ground, starting on the left side of the frame and moving diagonally forward to the right, creating a white wake. As the camera, positioned on the front of the second jet ski, moves smoothly forward while panning to the right, the person on the jet ski exits the frame on the right side. The scene is dominated by towering, reddish-orange sandstone cliffs that rise steeply from the edge of the water, with their layered rock formations perfectly reflected on the water's glassy surface. In the background, large canyon walls and the clear blue sky together occupy the top portion of the frame, with their reflections appearing on the water that extends from the foreground to the background. The entire scene moves forward from the perspective of the foreground watercraft, maintaining a deep focus that keeps both the jet ski and the surrounding canyon walls sharp. The bright, sunny day enhances the vivid colors of the canyon and the water, creating a striking visual contrast.",

    "Camera": "From an above-water, level-angle perspective, the camera moves smoothly forward while panning to the right to follow a jet ski. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping both the jet ski and the surrounding canyon walls sharp.",
    "Subject": "A person with light brown hair, wearing orange and black clothing, rides a white and green jet ski from left to right across the water, creating a white wake. The rider and their jet ski proceed to move out of the frame to the right. In the foreground at the bottom of the scene, the front portion of a second jet ski is visible, featuring white and yellow-green coloring, and it is moving forward.",
    "Motion": "A person on a jet ski travels from left to right across the water, creating a white wake. The jet ski continues its path and moves out of the frame to the right. The camera, positioned on the front of a second jet ski, moves forward through the water.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a view from a watercraft moving through a canyon on a bright, sunny day. The scene is dominated by towering, reddish-orange sandstone cliffs that rise steeply from the edge of a calm, dark green body of water. Under a clear blue sky, the layered rock formations are perfectly reflected on the water's glassy surface. Ahead, another person on a jet ski speeds across the water, leaving a prominent white wake behind them. The front of the viewer's own watercraft is visible at the bottom of the view.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
