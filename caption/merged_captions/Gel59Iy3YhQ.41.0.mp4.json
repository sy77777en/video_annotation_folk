  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot, initially focusing on a tree branch on the far left of the frame. A young person with blonde hair and glasses, wearing a purple shirt, an orange vest, and dark pants, stands in the center middle ground, holding a blue umbrella above them and a white book. In the background, a \"ODIN FINCH NATIONAL PARK\" sign is positioned in the top right, while a rocky wall with a \"Department of the Interior\" emblem occupies the left. Yellow subtitles are overlaid in the bottom center foreground, reading, \"I will never forget this weekend, Dad,\" with horizontal and vertical bar graphs resembling film reel markings at both the bottom and right side of the frame. A faint concentric circle, resembling a lens-like marking, is visible in the center of the frame. The video begins out of focus and then suddenly shifts to bring everything into focus as the camera zooms in, creating a dynamic transition that draws attention to the scene. As the camera executes a quick and unsteady zoom, the focus sharpens on the person but becomes blurry again before settling. The shot transitions to a medium shot, with the young person remaining in the center middle ground. The umbrella is now partially visible at the top center, and the book appears more prominent. The background sign and wall are partially obscured, while the foreground overlays remain in their respective positions. Throughout the shot, the camera maintains the subject's eye level. The frame, resembling a view through an old film viewer, features a film-like filter with numeric bar graphs and a slight tilt upward, ending with the camera focusing more closely on the person and their actions.",

    "Camera": "The video begins out of focus and then suddenly shifts to bring everything into focus as the camera zooms in. This creates a dynamic transition that draws attention to the scene. As the camera zooms in on a character reading under an umbrella, it goes out of focus again, adding a disoriented effect. The frame, resembling a view through an old film viewer, features a film-like filter with horizontal and vertical numeric bar graphs at the bottom and right side, respectively, and a faint concentric circle in the center, suggesting the shape of a camera lens. The scene smoothly zooms in with unsteady movements, ending with a slight tilt upward.",
    "Subject": "The video shows a young person with blonde hair and glasses, wearing a purple shirt, an orange vest, and dark pants. They stand outdoors in front of a rocky wall and a sign that reads \"ODIN FINCH NATIONAL PARK.\" The person holds a blue umbrella over their head with their right hand and reads from a white book held in their left hand. An overlay resembling a camera screen covers the entire video. The video includes a subtitle that reads, \"I will never forget this weekend, Dad.\" The camera quickly zooms in and is unsteady before focusing on the young person as they continue to read.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a distant view of a person standing in front of a rocky wall with a sign that reads 'ODIN FINCH NATIONAL PARK' and another sign for the National Park Service. The person is holding a blue umbrella and reading a book. As the camera zooms in, the person continues to read, and the subtitle 'I will never forget this weekend, Dad' appears at the bottom of the screen. The camera continues to zoom in, focusing more closely on the person and their actions.",
    "Scene": "The video depicts an outdoor scene at the entrance to \"ODIN FINCH NATIONAL PARK,\" as indicated by a large, dark brown wooden sign with white lettering. To the left of the sign, a rock wall features a \"Department of the Interior\" emblem. A person with blonde hair and glasses, wearing a purple and orange vest, stands under a light blue umbrella while reading a white book. The camera's unsteady zoom transitions from a full shot of the outdoor setting to a medium shot focusing on the person reading. The scene has a somewhat dim and slightly blurry, vintage aesthetic. Overlaid at the bottom of the screen is yellow text reading, \"I will never forget this weekend, Dad,\" along with film reel-like markings, a vertical bar graph on the right side, and a horizontal bar beneath the text containing numerical values.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
