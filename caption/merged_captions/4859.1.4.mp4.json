  "merged_caption": "This full shot captures a dynamic scene outdoors on a paved, grey surface under a bright, clear blue sky, suggesting daytime. On the left, a person in a full-body grey pigeon costume, featuring an orange beak, orange eyes, grey pants, and bright red shoes, is in the middle ground, blurred to indicate rapid movement as they hold a skateboard and strike the lid of a large, bright green, plastic wheeled trash bin situated in the center-right foreground, its lid ajar. To the right, another person wearing a bright yellow high-visibility vest over a dark grey short-sleeved shirt is bent over the bin, partially obscured by it, with their head hidden. The paved ground extends from the foreground to the middle ground, while indistinct city buildings and a body of water form the distant background across the upper frame, beneath a clear sky at the top. The overall image exhibits motion blur, particularly on the pigeon-costumed person and in the streaking of the background, enhancing the sense of movement. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level, initially at eye level with a level angle, then quickly pans right and tilts slightly down, resulting in a high angle. The movement is smooth and fast, with mild barrel distortion. A deep focus is maintained throughout, keeping a large depth of field. The person in the pigeon costume is positioned on the left, appearing to wave the skateboard as if to strike the lid of the trash bin, casting a long, dark shadow. The overall visual has a slightly blurred, dynamic quality, with the camera capturing the scene's energy and motion effectively.",

    "Camera": "The video exhibits mild barrel distortion. The camera is initially at eye level with a level angle, then quickly pans right and tilts slightly down, resulting in a high angle. The movement is smooth and fast. A deep focus is maintained throughout, keeping a large depth of field.",
    "Subject": "A person in a full-body grey pigeon costume, featuring an orange beak, orange eyes, grey pants, and bright red shoes, is positioned on the left. As the camera pans right and slightly tilts down, it reveals another person on the right, wearing a bright yellow high-visibility vest over a dark grey short-sleeved shirt, bent over a large, open, green wheeled trash bin with their head obscured by the bin.",
    "Motion": "The person in the pigeon costume is holding a skateboard and striking the bin lid forcefully, while the person in the high-visibility vest is bent over the bin.",
    "Scene": "The scene unfolds outdoors on a paved, grey surface under a bright, clear blue sky, suggesting daytime. In the background, indistinct city buildings and a body of water are visible. A large, bright green, plastic wheeled trash bin with its lid ajar is prominent in the foreground. To the left, a figure in a grey bird costume with an orange beak and red shoes is in motion, appearing to wave a skateboard as if to strike the lid of the trash bin, casting a long, dark shadow. To the right, another figure wearing a bright yellow, reflective safety vest is partially obscured by the trash bin. The overall visual has a slightly blurred, dynamic quality.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
