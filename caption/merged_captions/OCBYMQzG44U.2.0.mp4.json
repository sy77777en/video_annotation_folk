  "merged_caption": "This is a static, close-up scenery shot filmed from above the water, looking down through the surface at a swimming pool floor. The grid of greenish-grey tiles fills the entire frame, with a darker, irregularly shaped patch on the tiled surface in the center. A set of steps leading deeper into the pool is visible as a bright line along the top edge of the frame. The composition remains completely still throughout the video. The video is captured from a high angle, looking down at the water, with a fixed Dutch angle, resulting in a tilted perspective. The lens has mild barrel distortion, causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward. With a deep focus keeping the entire scene clear, the camera performs a very smooth, minor zoom-in on the tiled floor of the pool. The bottom is lined with a grid of small, square tiles, with a darker, wet-looking patch visible in the center. The scene is largely static with very subtle water movement. The water imparts a murky, green hue to the scene and creates a slight wavering distortion of the tiles below. The water's surface can be seen along the top edge, reflecting dim, diffuse light. The ripple of the water's surface is visible in the top left corner, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise still scene. The focus is entirely on the quiet, submerged environment, aiming to convey a specific mood through the visual texture of the tiles and the quality of the underwater light, rather than to follow a particular character or object.",

    "Subject": "This video captures a scene of a swimming pool's tiled floor from above the water's surface. The small, square tiles are a muted, dark green, and the water above them is slightly murky, creating a dim and somber atmosphere. In the center of the frame, a patch of tiles appears darker, suggesting a stain rather than a structural irregularity. The ripple of the water's surface is visible in the top left corner, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise still scene. The focus is entirely on the quiet, submerged environment, aiming to convey a specific mood through the visual texture of the tiles and the quality of the underwater light, rather than to follow a particular character or object.",

    "Scene": "From a perspective looking down into the water, the bottom of a pool is visible, lined with a grid of small, square, greenish-grey tiles. The water imparts a murky, green hue to the scene and creates a slight wavering distortion of the tiles below. A darker, irregularly shaped patch rests on the tiled surface in the center of the view. The water's surface can be seen along the top edge, reflecting dim, diffuse light.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
