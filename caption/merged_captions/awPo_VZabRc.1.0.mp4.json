  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a young man with pale skin and black, spiky hair, wearing a black jacket over a white t-shirt, positioned in the center middle ground, walking down the aisle of a crowded, moving subway car toward the camera. The interior is rendered in a stylized, angular animation with beige bench-style seating, vertical metal poles, and a dark, ribbed floor. A passenger is in the right foreground with their back to the viewer, while other passengers are seated in the left middle ground and standing in the background. The camera, maintaining a smooth, eye-level tracking shot, moves backward as the pickpocket advances, capturing his stealthy maneuvers as he discreetly steals items from passengers' pockets and conceals them in his clothing. As the man approaches, he becomes larger in the frame, and a man in a suit facing the camera appears in the left foreground before the shot transitions to a close-up. In this final composition, the main subject is reframed in the center foreground from the chest up, with his right hand holding a brown object, which appears to be a wallet stolen from another passenger. Only the man's chest and his right hand holding the brown object are visible, with no other passengers in view. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout the shot, maintaining a deep focus that keeps all characters and the background sharp. The color palette is predominantly muted, with desaturated tones of gray, blue, and brown, and through the windows, a dark, blurred landscape suggests the train is in motion. Surrounding the main character are other passengers depicted in a similar stylized, angular art style, either seated or standing, holding onto poles, leaning against railings, or facing the train doors.",

    "Camera": "This is a smooth, eye-level tracking shot that leads a man in a black jacket as he walks through a subway car. The camera moves backward, and as the man approaches, he becomes larger in the frame. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping all the characters and the background sharp.",
    "Subject": "The main subject of this animated video is a young man with pale skin and black, spiky hair. He wears a black jacket over a white t-shirt and is seen navigating through a crowded train car. Surrounding him are other passengers depicted in a similar stylized, angular art style. The passengers are either seated or standing, holding onto poles, leaning against railings, or facing the train doors, creating a packed environment through which the main character moves.",
    "Motion": "An animated young man, who is actually a pickpocket, walks down the aisle of a crowded train car, discreetly stealing items from passengers' pockets and concealing them in his own clothing. The camera moves backward as the pickpocket advances toward it, capturing his stealthy maneuvers as he squeezes between seated and standing individuals.",
    "Scene": "The scene takes place inside a crowded, moving subway car, rendered in a stylized, angular animation. The interior is characterized by beige bench-style seating, vertical metal poles for standing passengers, and a dark, ribbed floor. Through the windows, a dark, blurred landscape suggests the train is in motion. The color palette is predominantly muted, with desaturated tones of gray, blue, and brown. The car is filled with various passengers, some seated and others standing, as the perspective shifts through the narrow aisle.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a full shot of the main subject positioned in the center middle ground, walking down the train aisle toward the camera. A passenger is in the right foreground with their back to the viewer, while other passengers are seated in the left middle ground and standing in the background. As the camera moves backward, a man in a suit facing the camera appears in the left foreground of the frame before the shot transitions to a close-up. In this final composition, the main subject is reframed in the center foreground from the chest up, with his right hand holding a brown object, which appears to be a wallet stolen from another passenger.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
