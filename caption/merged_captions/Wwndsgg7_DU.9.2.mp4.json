  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot, where a woman with long hair that is brown at the top and gradually transitions to blonde is positioned slightly to the right and above the center of the frame, standing at the edge of a vast green grassy field that occupies the foreground and middle ground. She is wearing a white two-piece outfit consisting of a bandeau top and loose-fitting pants, paired with white sneakers. Behind her, a tall cornfield stretches horizontally across the background, with a dark pine forest visible further back, predominantly on the right side, and distant mountains in the far background on the left, under a pale sky at the top. The camera, exhibiting noticeable fisheye distortion, is positioned at eye level, employing a high angle view that looks down on the scene with a Dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping a large depth of field sharp. Initially static, the handheld camera then smoothly pans continuously to the left, tracking the woman as she begins to run across the lawn. As she runs towards the camera, her figure becomes larger in the frame, and briefly, her head moves out of the top of the frame, leaving her body from the neck down visible. Subsequently, as she runs away from the camera, moving towards the center of the frame, the shot remains wide, showing her full figure receding into the middle ground. The grassy field extends from the foreground to the background then, while the cornfield is no longer visible, and the forest and mountains are visible in the background. Yellow subtitles appear at the bottom of the screen, displaying the words \"Ohh,\" \"yes,\" \"yes, yes, yes,\" and \"that's it.\" At the end of the video, part of the filmer’s left hand appears, making an \"OK\" gesture.",

    "Camera": "The video exhibits noticeable fisheye distortion. The camera is positioned at eye level, employing a high angle view that looks down on the scene. A Dutch angle is present and varies due to camera rolling. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping a large depth of field sharp. Initially static, the handheld camera then smoothly pans continuously to the left, tracking a girl as she runs across the lawn.",
    "Subject": "The video features a woman with long hair that is brown at the top and gradually transitions to blonde. She is wearing a white two-piece outfit consisting of a bandeau top and loose-fitting pants, paired with white sneakers. She is seen running in a grassy field. Initially, she is visible in a wide shot. As she runs towards the camera, she becomes larger in the frame, and for a moment, only her body from the neck down is visible as her head moves out of the top of the frame. Subsequently, as she runs away from the camera, the view returns to a wider shot showing her full figure again.",
    "Motion": "The woman, initially standing in a grassy field, begins to run close to the camera. As she approaches, her figure becomes larger in the frame, and briefly, her head moves out of the top of the frame. She continues running in the same direction, receding into a wider shot that again shows her full figure.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot from a handheld panoramic camera, with noticeable distortion, shows a person running through a lush green grassy field. In the background, a tall, dense cornfield lines the edge of the meadow, with a dark green pine forest and distant mountains visible under a pale sky, indicating sunset or dusk. The camera moves with the person, capturing the motion through the long grass. Yellow subtitles appear at the bottom of the screen, displaying the words \"Ohh,\" \"yes,\" \"yes, yes, yes,\" and \"that's it.\" At the end of the video, part of the filmer’s left hand appears, making an \"OK\" gesture.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
