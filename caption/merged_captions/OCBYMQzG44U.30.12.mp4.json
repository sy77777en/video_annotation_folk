  "merged_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot of an empty room. The video begins with the camera positioned at a level angle, partially behind a white-tiled wall in the right foreground. The view looks across a large, tiled floor that occupies the bottom half of the frame, with a black and white geometric pattern in the middle ground. In the background, dark walls line the space, and two arched doorways are visible. The camera then performs two quick pans to the right, revealing more of the room. After the camera moves, only one arched doorway is visible on the left. A curved wall extends from the background to the right edge of the foreground. This smooth, eye-level shot exhibits mild barrel distortion and maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera moves forward into a tiled room while performing two quick pans to the right to reveal the full space. The room is characterized by its stark off-white and black tiled floor, dark lower walls, and a distant arched doorway, all illuminated by a combination of a large ceiling light and smaller spotlights, casting a yellow-green hue over the space. The floor is covered in small white tiles, with a rectangular area of white tiles framed by black tiles in the center. The lower portion of the walls is a dark, textured material, while the upper walls and ceiling are white, illuminated by several small circular white lights and one large, circular light fixture. An arched doorway is visible in the back wall. There is no main subject; the focus is entirely on the unsettling, liminal atmosphere and the stark, geometric design of the environment itself, making the empty space the point of interest.",

    "Motion": "This video presents a wide-angle scenery shot of a large, empty room. The camera moves in a point-of-view style, capturing the scene dynamically. The room is characterized by its stark off-white and black tiled floor, dark lower walls, and a distant arched doorway, all illuminated by a combination of a large ceiling light and smaller spotlights, casting a yellow-green hue over the space.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves through a large, sterile room under the glow of circular ceiling lights that cast a greenish-yellow hue. The floor is composed of small white tiles, with a large, white-tiled rectangle framed by glossy black tiles. The lower half of the walls are a dark, textured material, contrasting with the white upper walls and ceiling. An arched doorway is visible in the distance. The perspective pans quickly to the right, revealing more of the empty, tiled space.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
