  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot from a level angle, beginning with a wet stone patio with a transparent geometric overlay occupying the foreground and bottom half of the frame. A potted plant in a blue-green ceramic pot is in the bottom left, and another in a terracotta pot is in the bottom center. The middle ground features a lush green lawn, a low stone wall to the left, and a wooden fence running horizontally. In the background, two brown horses graze in a pasture dotted with yellow wildflowers, with a line of trees at the horizon under a cloudy sky. The camera, in an unsteady, first-person shot from an eye-level perspective, moves forward and tilts downward, changing from a level angle to a high-angle view that looks at the stone patio. As the camera tilts down, the composition shifts to a top-down view, focusing exclusively on the wet, stone-paved surface of the patio, which now fills the entire frame. The video is altered with a post-edited, trippy ripple effect, distorting the image and making the camera's focus unclear. The absence of a main subject allows the viewer to absorb the tranquil environment and the textures of the natural and man-made elements within it. A small shed and a light green spherical tank are visible next to the low stone wall, enhancing the rural setting. The camera's movement and the ripple effect create a dynamic visual experience, emphasizing the detailed, irregular pattern of the damp, weathered stones of the patio itself.",

    "Camera": "This is an unsteady, first-person shot from an eye-level perspective. The camera moves forward and tilts downward, changing from a level angle to a high-angle view that looks at the stone patio.

    "Subject": "This video presents a countryside scenery shot, focusing on the atmosphere of a quiet, rural setting rather than a specific subject. The view begins from a wet, flagstone patio, looking out over a vibrant green lawn towards a wooden-fenced pasture where two brown horses graze among yellow wildflowers under a cloudy sky. The camera then noticeably shakes as it tilts down, shifting the focus from the pastoral landscape to the detailed, irregular pattern of the damp, weathered stones of the patio itself. The absence of a main subject allows the viewer to absorb the tranquil environment and the textures of the natural and man-made elements within it.",
    "Motion": "This scenery shot begins on a stone patio overlooking a green field with horses grazing in the distance. The camera then tilts down to focus on the wet, stone-paved surface of the patio. Two potted plants sit at the edge of the patio where it meets the grass.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, looks out from a wet stone patio onto a rural landscape under an overcast sky. The camera tilts down to focus on the large, irregular stone pavers of the patio, which are marked with a transparent, dark geometric overlay. Two potted plants, one in a blue-green ceramic pot and the other in a terracotta pot, sit on the patio at the edge of a lush green lawn. A low stone wall stands to the left, next to a small shed and a light green spherical tank. In the background, a wooden fence encloses a large field dotted with yellow wildflowers, where two brown horses are visible grazing in the distance before a line of trees.",
    "Spatial": "This video presents a wide scenery shot from a level angle. Initially, a wet stone patio with a transparent geometric overlay occupies the foreground and bottom half of the frame, with a potted plant in the bottom left and another in the bottom center. The middle ground is composed of a green lawn, a low stone wall to the left, and a wooden fence running horizontally. In the background, two horses are visible in a pasture, with a line of trees at the horizon under a cloudy sky. The camera then tilts directly downwards, shifting the composition to a top-down view that focuses exclusively on the stone pavers of the patio, which now fill the entire frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
