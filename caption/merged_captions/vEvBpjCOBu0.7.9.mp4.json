  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium close-up shot of a man with metallic silver skin positioned on the right side of the frame, shown in profile and facing towards the left of the frame. He wears a dark, pinstriped suit jacket over a white collared shirt and a black fedora hat with a brown band. He has a short, sculpted beard and mustache, both of which share the same metallic texture as his skin. In his right hand, he holds up an empty, clear pint glass, which he appears to be examining. The scene is set against a solid black background and is lit from the side, creating distinct highlights on the silver skin and the glass. A small, white text overlay reading \"[32]\" is present in the bottom left corner. As the camera performs a smooth zoom out, it transitions to a medium shot, maintaining a level-angle, eye-level perspective with deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp. The man and the clear pint glass he holds in his right hand, slightly left of the frame's center, are both in the foreground. Throughout the video, the man remains completely still, holding the empty pint glass and looking at it against the black background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, ensuring that the entire scene remains in focus and sharp.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
