  "merged_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a wooden bench and a waterfall within a lush forest setting. The bench, made of logs with a rustic appearance and natural wood texture, is prominently positioned in the center of the foreground, with its simple, sturdy design clearly visible. It is composed of horizontal planks for the seat and backrest, supported by thicker horizontal logs. Behind the bench, a small waterfall cascades steadily down a rocky surface, extending from the top center of the background to the bottom right of the middle ground. The water flows energetically, creating a dynamic and lively movement in contrast to the stillness of the wooden bench. The surrounding dense foliage forms both the background and the middle ground, enveloping the scene in greenery. Sunlight filters through the trees, casting dappled shadows on the ground and highlighting the vibrant greenery, enhancing the natural ambiance. The camera is positioned at ground level with a level angle, using deep focus to keep both the wooden bench in the foreground and the waterfall in the background sharply in focus. The camera remains completely static throughout, with no movement or shaking, maintaining a level perspective. The overall atmosphere is serene, with the natural elements harmoniously blending together, and the clear, lively water adds a dynamic element to the tranquil scene.",

    "Scene": "The scene is set in a lush, green forest during the daytime, featuring a wooden bench positioned prominently in the foreground. The bench, made of logs with a rustic appearance, is placed on a patch of ground surrounded by dense foliage. Behind the bench, a small waterfall cascades down a rocky surface, adding a dynamic element to the tranquil setting. The water flows energetically, creating a contrast with the stillness of the bench. Sunlight filters through the trees, casting dappled shadows on the ground and highlighting the vibrant greenery.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
