  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot, the video initially focuses on the rear wooden stock of a rocket launcher, positioned diagonally from the bottom left towards the top right in the foreground/middle ground, resting on a ridged green surface in the background. The camera features a high-angle view with deep focus, capturing the weapon. The view then expands rightward as the camera slowly pans to the right and slightly tilts up, revealing the full length of the launcher, which maintains its diagonal foreground/middle ground position. The launcher has a distinct design with a wooden grip and a metallic body, showcasing a combination of dark and polished metal parts. The wooden section is reddish-brown, contrasting with the sleek, dark metal. The camera continues to move, revealing two green, conical rocket-propelled grenades with pointed tips and cylindrical bodies, lying next to the launcher on the right side of the frame, also in the foreground/middle ground. The grenades have a smooth, matte finish, and their color is a muted olive green. The camera captures their details, such as their pointed tips and cylindrical bodies. The scene is dimly lit, with focused light casting shadows across the ridged surface. The camera then moves forward to approach the launcher and grenades, emphasizing their detailed construction and arrangement. The background consists of a corrugated surface, likely a metal or plastic sheet, providing a stark contrast to the dark and bright colors of the launcher and grenades. The overall composition highlights the launcher and grenades as the central subjects, emphasizing their detailed construction and arrangement.",

    "Camera": "The video features a high-angle view with deep focus, capturing a weapon. The camera smoothly pans right and slightly tilts up to reveal the entire weapon, then moves forward to approach it.",
    "Subject": "The video features a rocket-propelled grenade launcher prominently displayed on a corrugated surface. The launcher has a distinct design with a wooden grip and a metallic body, showcasing a combination of dark and polished metal parts. The wooden section is reddish-brown, contrasting with the sleek, dark metal. The launcher is positioned horizontally, with its barrel extending towards the upper right corner. Adjacent to the launcher, there are two green, conical rocket-propelled grenades, each with a pointed tip and cylindrical body, lying next to the launcher. The grenades have a smooth, matte finish, and their color is a muted olive green. The overall composition highlights the launcher and grenades as the central subjects, emphasizing their detailed construction and arrangement.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a close-up of the tip of a rocket-propelled grenade launcher, showing its dark, metallic barrel and wooden grip. The camera slowly pans to the right, revealing more of the launcher's body, which is made of polished metal and wood. As the camera continues to move, the full length of the launcher becomes visible, including its handle and the attached rocket-propelled grenades. The grenades are green and conical, lying next to the launcher, and the camera captures their details, such as their pointed tips and cylindrical bodies. The background consists of a corrugated surface, likely a metal or plastic sheet, providing a stark contrast to the dark and bright colors of the launcher and grenades.",
    "Scene": "The video shows a rocket launcher and three rockets resting on a dark green surface with parallel ridges. The launcher has a dark metal body, a reddish-brown wooden stock and grip, and a black muzzle end. The rockets are light green, cylindrical, with pointed tips and fins. The scene is dimly lit, with focused light casting shadows across the ridged surface. The view initially focuses on the rear part of the launcher before revealing the entire weapon and the adjacent rockets.",
    "Spatial": "In a medium shot, the video initially focuses on the rear wooden stock of a rocket launcher, positioned diagonally from the bottom left towards the top right in the foreground/middle ground, resting on a ridged green surface in the background. The view then expands rightward, revealing the full length of the launcher, which maintains its diagonal foreground/middle ground position. Two rockets appear close to the launcher on the right side of the frame, also in the foreground/middle ground. The camera is positioned above the subjects throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
