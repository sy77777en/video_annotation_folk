  "merged_caption": "The video presents a full shot of a man with a light skin tone, wearing a white tank top, black pants, a black knit hat, white socks, and black and white sneakers, initially positioned in the center foreground, bent over his skateboard on a concrete sidewalk in an urban environment. To his left, in the middle ground, a black sedan is parked, with a tall, metallic light pole to the right of it. Green bushes are visible in the center behind the man, with a modern building featuring vertically placed ornamental railings and a cut-out garage entrance with hexagonal patterns in the right background. Palm trees line the left and central background. The sky appears bright, and a fisheye lens effect is visible in the upper right and lower right corners. The camera is positioned at ground level with a level angle, utilizing a deep focus that keeps a large depth of field sharp. The man lifts his left leg and pushes off the sidewalk, propelling himself and the skateboard forward, then places his left foot back onto the moving skateboard. The camera moves forward at a slight angle, tracking the skateboarder from a rear-side perspective, causing the skateboarder to appear larger in the frame over time. Around the middle of the video, the camera pans slightly to the left as the skateboarder moves slightly left, positioning himself more directly in front of the camera. The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking. By the end of the sequence, the man remains in the center foreground, continuing to move forward and slightly towards the left within the frame, remaining in the foreground.",

    "Subject": "A man with a light skin tone is skateboarding on a sidewalk. He wears a white tank top, black pants, a black knit hat, white socks, and black and white sneakers. He is initially bent over his skateboard and then pushes off with his left leg.",
    "Motion": "The man, initially bent over his skateboard, lifts his left leg and pushes off the sidewalk, propelling himself and the skateboard forward. He then places his left foot back onto the moving skateboard.",
    "Scene": "The video is set on a concrete sidewalk in an urban environment, illuminated by ambient light. To the left, a street with parked cars, including a prominent black sedan, runs parallel to the sidewalk. A tall, metallic light pole stands near the curb. To the right, a modern building with a light-colored facade featuring vertically placed ornamental railings is visible, along with a cut-out garage entrance composed of numerous hexagonal patterns. Lush green bushes and several palm trees line the edge of the sidewalk and the area in front of the building. The sky appears bright. A fisheye lens effect is visible in the upper right and lower right corners.",
    "Spatial": "The video presents a full shot of a man initially positioned in the center foreground, bent over his skateboard, which is also in the foreground. To his left, in the middle ground, a black sedan is parked, with a light pole to the right of it. Green bushes are visible in the center behind the man, with a modern building in the right background. Palm trees are seen in the left and central background. The man then pushes off with his left leg, causing him and the skateboard to move forward and slightly towards the left within the frame, remaining in the foreground. By the end of the sequence, the man remains in the center foreground, continuing to move forward. The camera is positioned at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
