  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a yellowish biplane with white wings partially visible in the left foreground, occupying 50% of the frame's height. The camera is at an aerial level, initially adopting a low angle looking upwards, which transitions to a level angle as it moves. The biplane ascends, initially shifting left before curving to the right and moving into the middle ground, diminishing in size until it occupies about 5% of the frame’s height in the upper left. The camera executes a very smooth upward movement while trucking to the left, performing an initial slight pan to the left, which then shifts to a pan to the right. A tall, cylindrical white lighthouse with several windows and dark patches, possibly indicating wear or damage, stands prominently on the right side of the frame, initially in the middle ground, with a small white building with a sloped red roof and a dark, military-style vehicle at its base. Large, greyish-brown rocks dominate the middle ground across the bottom half of the frame. As the aircraft moves to the middle ground, the lighthouse and rocks become part of the foreground. In the background, hazy, light brown mountains stretch across the horizon, beneath a clear blue sky that fills the upper portion of the frame, where a single, small, white cloud is visible in the center-right. The scene is sun-drenched and arid, with the biplane flying from left to right, remaining on the left side of the frame. The camera maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field throughout, capturing the biplane as it continues to fly upward and to the right, gradually moving away from the camera.",

    "Camera": "The camera is at an aerial level, initially adopting a low angle looking upwards, which transitions to a level angle as it moves. A deep focus with a large depth of field is maintained throughout. The camera executes a very smooth upward movement while trucking to the left. It also performs an initial slight pan to the left, which then shifts to a pan to the right.",
    "Subject": "In the video, a yellowish biplane with white wings is seen. Initially, only the rear half of the aircraft is visible on the far left, but it moves forward to become fully visible, appearing smaller as it flies further away. Positioned on the right side, atop a cluster of large, greyish-brown rocks, stands a tall, cylindrical white lighthouse. The lighthouse features several windows and some dark patches indicating wear or damage. A small, white building with a dark roof is situated at the base of the lighthouse. Near this small building, a dark, military-style vehicle is parked amongst the rocks.",
    "Motion": "A yellowish biplane with white wings enters the frame from the bottom, initially moving to the left before changing direction and ascending along a curved trajectory to the right. The plane continues to fly upward and to the right, gradually moving away from the camera. The background consists of a rocky terrain with a tall, white lighthouse standing prominently on the right side. The lighthouse has several windows and dark patches, possibly indicating wear or damage. A small, white building with a dark roof is situated at the base of the lighthouse. A dark, military-style vehicle is parked to the right of the small building.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone shows a biplane flying in a clear blue sky over a sun-drenched, arid, rocky landscape. In the middle ground, large, weathered grey boulders cover a hilly terrain, gradually becoming part of the foreground as the biplane moves further away. A tall, cylindrical, white lighthouse with a few dark, damaged patches on its surface and a visible lantern room at the top stands prominently. At the base of the lighthouse, a small white building with a sloped red roof is visible. In the distance, hazy, light brown mountains stretch across the horizon under the bright sky, with a single, small, white cloud visible. The airplane, with yellow and white wings, flies from left to right, remaining on the left side of the frame.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
