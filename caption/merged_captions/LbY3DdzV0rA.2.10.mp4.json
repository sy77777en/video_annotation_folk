  "merged_caption": "This video features an extreme wide shot of a vast canyon landscape with no main subject. The expansive canyon fills the bottom half of the frame, extending from the foreground deep into the background. A small, winding river is positioned in the bottom left of the frame, deep within the canyon in the middle ground. The sky occupies the top half of the frame, with a layer of dark clouds situated horizontally across the middle ground and lighter clouds scattered in the background sky above. The sun is positioned on the left side of the frame, creating a glow from behind the clouds. As the video progresses, the sun casts beams of light that sweep diagonally across the canyon from the left to the right. This is a time-lapse video shot from a high, aerial-level perspective with a level angle, looking out over the Grand Canyon. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire landscape sharp. The camera performs a slow and smooth pan from left to right as the sun sets and clouds move rapidly across the sky. Initially, the sun is hidden behind the clouds, emitting a gentle golden glow that gradually intensifies as it breaks through the gaps. This glow casts sweeping sunbeams through the clouds, illuminating the hazy atmosphere and parts of the distant landscape. In the distance, curtains of rain can be seen falling from the base of the darker clouds. The scene is dynamic, with the light and clouds constantly changing, casting shifting rays of light and shadows across the vast canyon landscape. The time-lapse captures an extreme wide, elevated view of a vast canyon at sunset or sunrise, with the light and shadows continuously shifting across the terrain.",

    "Subject": "This video presents a dramatic landscape scenery shot of a vast canyon at sunrise or sunset. Initially, the sun is hidden behind the clouds, emitting a gentle golden glow that gradually intensifies as it breaks through the gaps. This glow casts sweeping sunbeams through the clouds, illuminating the hazy atmosphere and parts of the distant landscape. The expansive canyon, with its layered rock formations, is cast mostly in deep shadow, while a thin, winding river is visible at its bottom. Above, the sky is a dynamic canvas of dark, heavy storm clouds and lighter, puffy clouds against a backdrop of blue. In the distance, curtains of rain can be seen falling from the base of the darker clouds. There is no main subject, as the shot's purpose is to capture the immense scale of the natural environment and the awe-inspiring atmospheric spectacle of the changing light and weather.",
    "Motion": "This is a time-lapse video of a dramatic sunset or sunrise over the Grand Canyon. Clouds move swiftly across the sky as the sun descends or ascends, casting shifting rays of light and shadows across the vast canyon landscape. The scene is dynamic, with the light and clouds constantly changing.",
    "Scene": "A time-lapse captures an extreme wide, elevated view of a vast canyon at sunset or sunrise. The sky is filled with a mix of dark, heavy storm clouds and white, illuminated clouds against a blue background. As the sun dips toward the horizon on the left, its golden light breaks through the clouds, casting dramatic sunbeams that sweep across the layered rock formations of the canyon. Much of the expansive landscape is in shadow, with a winding river visible at the bottom. In the distance, rain appears to fall from the base of the dark clouds while the light and shadows continuously shift across the terrain.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
