  "merged_caption": "This is an eye-level, wide shot of an empty, modernistic room, featuring a swift pan to the left. The foreground and bottom half of the frame are dominated by a floor with a large white tiled area in the center, framed by black tiles on the left and right. In the middle ground, dark, curved lower walls extend across the frame, with lighter-colored upper walls above them. A narrow, arched doorway is visible in the center-background, while the ceiling, featuring several recessed lights and a larger circular fixture, occupies the top of the frame. The camera smoothly pans to the left and then moves forward at a regular speed toward the arched doorway, providing a comprehensive view of the entire room. The space is defined by its curved walls, which feature a two-tone design with a dark, textured lower section and a smooth, off-white upper portion that blends into the ceiling where several recessed lights cast a soft, greenish-hued glow. The wide, level-angle perspective emphasizes the room's unusual curves, stark contrasts, and enigmatic, empty atmosphere. The first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves through the large, unfurnished indoor space, highlighting the bold geometric pattern of the floor and the architectural space itself.",

    "Camera": "This eye-level, deep-focus shot features a smooth, quick left pan and then moves forward at a regular speed toward the arched doorway.",
    "Subject": "This is an interior scenery shot of a stark, modernistic room. The space is defined by its curved walls, which feature a two-tone design with a dark, textured lower section and a smooth, off-white upper portion that blends into the ceiling where several recessed lights cast a soft, greenish-hued glow. A striking geometric pattern of large white and black tiles dominates the floor, and a narrow, arched doorway is visible in the distance. There is no main subject, as the focus is deliberately placed on the architectural space itself. The wide, level-angle perspective emphasizes the room's unusual curves, stark contrasts, and enigmatic, empty atmosphere.",
    "Motion": "This is a wide-angle, scenery shot of a modern, minimalist room. The space features two-toned curved walls, a glossy floor with a black and white tile pattern, and recessed ceiling lights. The camera quickly pans to the left through the empty room.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves through a large, unfurnished indoor space. The room features curved walls, with the lower portion finished in a dark, textured material and the upper portion, along with the ceiling, in a lighter off-white. The floor is laid with a bold geometric pattern of a large white tiled area bordered by glossy black tiles. Several recessed spotlights and a larger circular fixture illuminate the room from the ceiling. The perspective shifts to the left, providing a comprehensive view of the entire room. ",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
