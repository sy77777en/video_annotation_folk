  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot capturing a dynamic cityscape, featuring the grand Altar of the Fatherland monument in Rome. The camera, positioned at a low angle, looks slightly up at the large building, maintaining a deep focus to keep the entire monument and its surroundings sharp. The camera moves to the right and pans to the left, performing a parallax shot to reveal the monument, which dominates the middle ground and extends into the background. The massive white neoclassical building features a wide central staircase, a large colonnade, and is crowned by two prominent bronze quadrigas on its roofline, all set against a blue sky with scattered white clouds. An equestrian statue stands at the monument's center, and two large Italian flags on tall poles flank the main structure. In the foreground, a green lawn with flowerbeds of red and white flowers spans the bottom of the frame. A road with flowing traffic, including white taxis, stretches horizontally between the lawn and the monument in the middle ground. The plaza is bustling with pedestrians, and a few people are visible on the steps of the monument. Occasionally, the heads or shoulders of nearby tourists briefly pass across the lower foreground. The camera's slightly unsteady movement captures the impressive architecture against the sky, emphasizing the architectural grandeur and the bustling atmosphere of the surrounding piazza.",

    "Subject": "This video presents a cityscape scenery shot centered on the grand Altar of the Fatherland monument in Rome. The immense, white neoclassical building features a wide central staircase, a large colonnade, and is crowned by two prominent bronze quadrigas on its roofline, all set against a blue sky with scattered white clouds. An equestrian statue stands at the monument's center, and two large Italian flags on tall poles flank the main structure. The composition lacks a single main subject, instead emphasizing the architectural grandeur and the bustling atmosphere of the surrounding piazza, which includes traffic, pedestrians, and flowerbeds of red and white flowers on a large green lawn in the foreground.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenic, wide cityscape shot of the grand Altar of the Fatherland in Rome. The massive white monument is viewed from across a plaza with a constant flow of vehicles and people passing by.

    "Scene": "An outdoor, daytime view captures the Victor Emmanuel II National Monument in Rome, Italy, set against a blue sky with scattered white clouds. The grand, white marble building is characterized by a wide central staircase, a prominent colonnade, and an equestrian statue at its center. Atop the structure, two bronze quadrigas are positioned on the upper corners. Two large Italian flags are displayed on flagpoles flanking the main staircase. In the foreground, a green lawn features flowerbeds with red and white flowers. A road with flowing traffic, including white taxis, separates the lawn from the monument, where a few people are visible on the steps and the road is bustling with pedestrians.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a wide shot capturing a dynamic cityscape. The camera moves to the right and pans to the left, revealing the Altar of the Fatherland monument, which dominates the middle ground and extends into the background. In the foreground, a green lawn with flowerbeds spans the bottom of the frame. A road with traffic stretches horizontally between the lawn and the monument in the middle ground. Pedestrians are visible around the base of the monument and across the plaza. Two large Italian flags on poles flank the monument's central staircase in the middle ground.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
