  "merged_caption": "This medium shot frames a male-presenting mannequin from the hip up, positioned slightly left of center in the middle ground. The mannequin, with a featureless, smooth, metallic silver head and matching hands, is dressed in a light blue, long-sleeved collared shirt and a light grey tie. It holds a plain, light brown cardboard box with both hands in front of its chest, in the center-left of the frame. The mannequin stands completely still. In the foreground, a desk is visible at the bottom, and after the camera moves down, its edge becomes visible. A dark shelving unit containing several binders occupies the far-left side, below part of the frame, in the background, while a wall covered in vertical wood paneling fills the entire background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, filmed from a level, eye-level perspective, maintaining a deep focus that keeps both the figure and the background sharp. The camera executes a slow downward movement with minimal unsteadiness. The scene features a text overlay at the bottom-left that reads \"[4]\" and fades away in the second part of the video.",

    "Motion": "The mannequin stands completely still, holding a cardboard box in front of its chest.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set indoors with a wall covered in vertical wood paneling. A faceless, metallic figure dressed in a light-colored shirt and tie stands behind a desk, holding a plain cardboard box. To the left of the figure, a dark shelving unit contains several binders. The scene features a text overlay at the bottom-left that reads \"[4]\" and fades away in the second part of the video.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
