  "merged_caption": "In a static full shot, a young child with fair skin and short, dark hair stands mostly still on a sidewalk in the center-right of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. The child wears a light-colored collared shirt, a dark skirt or shorts, light-colored socks, and dark shoes, holding a dark, folded piece of fabric, possibly a jacket or blanket, clutched to their chest. The child faces forward, looking directly ahead with a neutral expression. The scene is set outdoors at night, bathed in a deep blue light, with a paved sidewalk next to a cobblestone street. In the foreground, a curb extends horizontally across the bottom of the frame. Behind the child, a tall, dark, wrought-iron fence with decorative scrollwork and diamond-shaped patterns spans the width of the scene, visible in the background. The area between the sidewalk and the fence consists of dark, unpaved ground. The overall lighting is dim, casting the surroundings in shadow. The camera is positioned at the child's level, using a deep focus to keep both the young child in the middle ground and the fence in the background sharp. The child remains mostly still throughout the video, with only slight movements, maintaining the static, eye-level shot with a level angle.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
