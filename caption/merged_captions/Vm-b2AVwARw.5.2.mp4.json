  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a medium full shot, captured from a high angle, showing a woman with short black hair and pale, greyish skin standing motionless in a modern kitchen, holding the handle of a light-colored canister vacuum cleaner with a black, flexible hose. She is wearing a blue, long-sleeved blazer over a white top and light-colored pants, with her head tilted down and a downcast expression as she looks towards the vacuum. The kitchen features dark wood cabinetry, a light wood parquet floor, and grey, textured walls resembling marble or unfinished concrete. A large, grey central kitchen island with a built-in cooktop and three U-shaped, light wood stools tucked underneath occupies the center middle ground, extending from the left of the frame, with a long, thin, modern light fixture suspended above it. A small white bowl is located on the bottom right side of the kitchen island. In the background, a stainless steel range hood and built-in appliances are visible across the top portion of the scene. Overlay text \"[27]\" appears in the bottom left corner. As the shot progresses, the camera smoothly descends with a slight upward tilt, arcing clockwise to maintain focus on the mannequin-like figure, transitioning from a high angle to a level one. This movement results in a medium shot of the woman, now framed at her level, with a shallow depth of field that keeps her in focus. She remains positioned in the right half of the frame, with the kitchen island and background elements still visible but less prominent. Throughout the video, the woman remains completely still, enhancing the static nature of the scene.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
