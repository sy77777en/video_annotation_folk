  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot showing a cartoon boy with an atypically large and stylized brown hairstyle, sitting at a wooden desk in a classroom during the daytime. His hair is sculpted into several large, rounded, cloud-like sections forming a voluminous bouffant. He has a light skin tone, large blue eyes with heavy eyelids, and eyebrows angled upwards toward the center. Dressed in a white collared shirt and a green sweater vest, he rests his cheek on one hand while holding a yellow pencil in the other, looking down at a piece of paper on his desk. The classroom features blue walls, a large green chalkboard, and sunlight streaming through a window on the left, casting natural light onto the scene. A stack of books with colorful covers is placed in the middle ground on the left, transitioning to the foreground. The window reveals green foliage outside, indicating a clear day. The camera is at the same height as the seated boy, providing a straight-on, eye-level view with a shallow depth of field, focusing on the boy in the midground. The shot transitions to a medium shot, cropping closer to the main boy so that only his head, shoulders, arms, and the upper part of the desk are visible, with the boy remaining centered in the frame. The partial figure of another boy, wearing the same attire, is visible to the left in the foreground but becomes less visible as the shot tightens. The boy lets out a deep sigh, remaining mostly still throughout the video.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, capturing the scene with deep focus and a large depth of field. It smoothly arcs counterclockwise around a group of people seated at a table, ensuring all elements remain sharp and clear.",
    "Subject": "The video features a group of men seated in a row at a long table. They are all wearing similar attire, consisting of light-colored shirts and pants. The men have varied hairstyles, with all of them having short hair. They are positioned closely together, facing the same direction, suggesting a sense of uniformity and focus. The lighting is dim, casting shadows that emphasize the collective presence of the group rather than individual features. The overall composition highlights the uniformity and alignment of the subjects.",
    "Motion": "In a dimly lit room with a plain background, a group of people is seated on ordinary chairs arranged in a line, facing away from the camera. Some individuals are raising their hands in front of them, while others are simply sitting. Their postures are fixed, with no apparent motion.",
    "Scene": "The video depicts an indoor setting with a dimly lit, minimalist environment. A long, dark table extends across the scene, surrounded by a row of identical chairs. Seated at the table are multiple figures, all wearing similar attire, facing away from the viewer. Soft light is cast above the table, and the floor reflects the shadows of the row of people, emitting a faint sheen. The atmosphere is calm and still, with no visible movement or activity. Overlays include a small text element located at [25,28], which is not part of the scene itself.",
    "Spatial": "This is a wide shot showing a group of men seated in a row at a long table. The row of men extends from left to right, occupying the horizontal center of the frame and positioned in the middle ground. The table is directly in front of them, also in the middle ground and spanning the central width of the frame. The chairs are beneath the men, in the middle ground. The reflective floor occupies the bottom portion of the frame, mirroring the subjects. The background is a dimly lit, indistinct space behind the men. Initially, the camera is positioned slightly towards the left side of the row. Over the first few seconds, the camera performs an arc movement, resulting in a more centered view of the entire row of men within the frame. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
