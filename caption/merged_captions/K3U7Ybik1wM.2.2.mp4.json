  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot, where the camera is at a level angle, maintaining a consistent height with the flowers throughout the scene. Initially, the focus is on the middle ground, where two open yellow flowers and two small flower buds are visible: one open flower with an attached bud on its stem is positioned slightly left of center, while a second open flower and a separate small, unopened bud are located slightly right of center. The foreground is blurred, and the background is a soft green field with out-of-focus yellow flowers, creating a bokeh effect. The camera uses an extremely shallow depth of field, initially focusing on the midground flowers, then rack focusing to the foreground flower. The focus gradually shifts from these middle ground elements to the foreground, causing some elements in the middle to become out of focus. After a brief blur during the transition, the shot becomes an extreme close-up, sharply focusing on a single yellow buttercup flower positioned in the foreground, slightly left of center. This flower, with its five distinct yellow petals and a visible yellow center, is attached to a slender green stem. A smaller, closed bud, displaying both green and yellow hues, is visible on the same stem to the right of this open flower, also in the foreground. The background remains a soft, out-of-focus expanse of green and yellow, suggesting a field of similar flowers. The camera shows some minor, slightly unsteady movement, tilting down, enhancing the dynamic feel of the scene. The sunlit field and the blurred tapestry of green foliage and other indistinct yellow blossoms create an extreme shallow depth of field, emphasizing the delicate beauty of the focused flowers.",

    "Subject": "The video begins with a soft-focus, blurry view of numerous small, bright yellow flowers scattered across a vibrant green field, creating a bokeh effect. In the middle ground, two bright yellow flowers and two small flower buds are actually in sharp focus. The camera then transitions by shifting focus from the middle ground to the foreground, with a brief moment where the focus is out of focus. It then brings a single yellow buttercup flower into sharp focus in the foreground. This flower, with its five distinct yellow petals and a visible yellow center, is attached to a slender green stem. To the right of the open flower, on the same stem, a smaller, closed bud, both yellow and green, is also in focus. The background remains a soft, out-of-focus expanse of green and yellow, suggesting a field of similar flowers.",

The focus gradually shifts from the middle ground to the foreground, causing some elements in the middle to become out of focus. Ultimately, the focus settles on a single yellow buttercup and a flower bud to its right, with the background and middle ground remaining a soft, out-of-focus expanse of green and yellow.",
    "Scene": "The video presents an outdoor scene in a sunlit field, where the initial view focuses on the middle ground, showcasing two small yellow flowers in relative clarity, while both the background and foreground are blurred. The background is dotted with many small yellow flowers. The focus gradually shifts, bringing a single, delicate yellow buttercup with five distinct petals into sharp clarity in the foreground. This flower, along with a smaller, unopened bud, is supported by a slender green stem. The background remains a blurred tapestry of green foliage and other indistinct yellow blossoms, creating an extreme shallow depth of field.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
