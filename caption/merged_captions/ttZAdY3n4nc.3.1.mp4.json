  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot, a young, light-skinned man with a serious expression stands in the foreground of a dusty Old West town street during what appears to be sunset, with a warm, golden-orange light illuminating the environment. He wears a dark, wide-brimmed cowboy hat, a brown suit jacket over a matching vest, a white collared shirt, and a red tie. A pocket watch chain is visible across his vest, and a pistol in a holster is strapped to his right hip. Groups of men and women dressed in late 19th-century Western attire line the left and right sides of the frame, occupying the middle ground and background, standing still and observing him. The men wear hats and suits, while the women are in long dresses, all in muted earth tones. The scene is flanked by two-story, weathered wooden buildings with porches. At first, the young man has his hands behind his back, then his right hand moves to his right hip, as if he is about to draw a gun. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout the scene, beginning level and transitioning into a Dutch angle as it steadily rolls counterclockwise, gradually increasing the angle. The shallow depth of field keeps the man in the foreground in focus, while the background is only slightly blurred. This sequence showcases a dolly zoom effect, with the camera smoothly moving forward while simultaneously zooming out, enhancing the tension as the man remains standing in place in the center of the wide, unpaved dirt street.",

    "Scene": "This outdoor scene is set in a dusty Old West town during what appears to be sunset, with a warm, golden-orange light illuminating the environment. A wide, unpaved dirt street runs through the center, flanked on both sides by two-story, weathered wooden buildings with porches. A young man wearing a dark, wide-brimmed hat and a brown suit walks down the middle of the street. In the background, groups of people in period clothing stand along the sides of the road.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
