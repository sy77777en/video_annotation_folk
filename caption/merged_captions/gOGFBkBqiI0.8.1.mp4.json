  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium close-up of a Black woman with long black braids, some dyed red and yellow, and a yellow butterfly clip in her hair, positioned slightly left of center in the foreground. She is draped in an American flag, revealing a blue and white striped top and a silver necklace with a circular pendant underneath. She smiles as she speaks into a black microphone in the bottom center foreground. The background consists of a red running track and a green field inside a large, brightly lit athletics stadium, with multi-tiered red and white spectator stands visible, though mostly empty. Blue banners with white \"TDK\" logos line the edge of the track. The camera, positioned at eye level, begins with a shallow depth of field, focusing on the first woman. As the camera smoothly pans right and simultaneously zooms out, two more Black women are revealed, joining her in the frame. The depth of field deepens, bringing the entire group into clear focus. The woman in the middle has her dark hair pulled back, is also draped in an American flag over a blue top, and is laughing while holding a water bottle. The woman on the far right wears a white headband in her dark hair and is draped in an American flag over a blue top with the name \"TERRY\" in white letters. All three women are smiling and appear to take turns speaking into the microphone. A hand holding a black microphone with the NBC logo and the word \"Sports\" is extended towards them from the right foreground, indicating they are being interviewed as a group. At the very end of the video, a fourth woman becomes partially visible on the far right of the frame, holding an American flag and smiling.",

    "Scene": "From a television broadcast-style viewpoint, the scene is set at night within a large, brightly lit athletics stadium. A red running track encircles a green grass infield, with multi-tiered red and white spectator stands visible in the background, though the seats appear mostly empty. Blue banners with white \"TDK\" logos line the edge of the track. Three female athletes, draped in red, white, and blue American flags, are being interviewed near the track as a microphone with a \"Sports\" logo is held up to them. The stadium lights illuminate the scene, while a few people on the field and around the track remain softly out of focus, enhancing the scene's realism.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium close-up of a woman positioned slightly left of center in the foreground, with a microphone in the bottom center foreground. The background consists of a red running track and a green field inside a stadium. The camera then zooms out to a medium shot, revealing two additional women standing to the right of the first, all positioned in the foreground just behind a thin piece of plywood. In the final composition, the first woman is on the left, the second is in the center, and the third is on the right. A hand holding a microphone enters from the right foreground, pointed towards the group. The stadium setting remains in the background. At the very end of the video, a fourth woman becomes partially visible on the far right of the frame, holding an American flag. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
