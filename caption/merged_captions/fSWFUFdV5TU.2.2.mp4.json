  "merged_caption": "A medium shot shows a man with dark, curly hair from behind, positioned in the center middle ground as he leans over a light-colored wall on a balcony at night. He is wearing a dark, possibly denim, jacket with prominent seams. In the background, a dark cityscape with blurred lights is visible, and small white particles fall steadily throughout the scene. The man, initially leaning forward, holds a long, unclear object in front of his head. As the clip progresses, he bends down further, eventually squatting down slightly over the wall, seemingly captivated by the view. The camera, positioned at the man's level from a hip-height perspective, smoothly tilts downward to follow his movement. The shot uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the man in the midground in focus against the blurry city background.",

    "Scene": "The scene is set on a balcony at night, overlooking a dark cityscape where building lights appear as blurred, out-of-focus points in the distance. Small white particles fall steadily through the air. In the middleground, a person in a dark jacket leans forward and bends down slightly over a plain, light-colored wall, seemingly captivated by the view.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
