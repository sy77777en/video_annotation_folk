  "merged_caption": "In a full shot, a young, dark gray elephant with large ears is positioned in the center foreground, walking toward the camera through a field of tall, dry, golden grass. Directly behind it in the middle ground and slightly to the left stands a larger adult elephant, also dark gray, initially still before taking a slow step forward. On the right edge of the frame, also in the middle ground, a third elephant is partially visible, with only its head, trunk, and a white tusk showing as it remains stationary, using its trunk to pick something up from the ground and bring it to its mouth. The scene is set in a vast, open savanna illuminated by the warm, golden light of either early morning or late afternoon. The landscape is covered in tall, dry grass, its yellow and brown tones stretching towards a distant horizon of gently rolling hills. A few sparse, dark-leafed trees are scattered across the midground, breaking up the otherwise uniform expanse of grassland. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level in a static, eye-level shot with a deep focus, keeping both the elephants and the distant savanna landscape in sharp view. The camera remains fixed with only slight unsteadiness, capturing the temporal progression as the young elephant moves forward and the larger adult elephant takes a step, while the third elephant on the right continues its feeding action.",

    "Camera": "This is a static, eye-level shot with a deep focus, keeping both the elephants and the distant savanna landscape in sharp view. The camera remains fixed with only slight unsteadiness.",
    "Subject": "A young, dark gray elephant with large ears walks forward through a field of tall, dry, golden grass. Directly behind it and slightly to the left, a larger adult elephant, also dark gray, stands in profile facing left. On the far right, the head, trunk, and a white tusk of a third elephant are partially visible.",
    "Motion": "A young elephant walks forward through a field of tall grass. Behind it, a larger adult elephant stands still before taking a slow step forward. A third elephant, partially visible on the right, remains stationary while using its trunk to pick something up from the ground and bring it to its mouth.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set in a vast, open savanna illuminated by the warm, golden light of either early morning or late afternoon. The landscape is covered in tall, dry grass, its yellow and brown tones stretching towards a distant horizon of gently rolling hills. A few sparse, dark-leafed trees are scattered across the midground, breaking up the otherwise uniform expanse of grassland. In the foreground, a smaller elephant is positioned slightly in front of a larger one directly behind it, while another elephant is on the right edge of the frame, with only its head, trunk, and tusks visible.",
    "Spatial": "In a full shot, a young elephant is positioned in the center foreground, walking toward the camera. Directly behind it in the middle ground and slightly to the left stands a larger adult elephant. On the right edge of the frame, also in the middle ground, a third elephant is partially visible. The scene is set in a field of tall grass that occupies the foreground and middle ground, with a few trees scattered in the middle ground and rolling hills visible in the distant background. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
