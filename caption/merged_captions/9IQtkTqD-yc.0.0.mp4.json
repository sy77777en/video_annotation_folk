  "merged_caption": "This video presents a slightly shaky, static wide shot of a rural landscape at night, viewed through the circular vignette of a night vision device. The camera is positioned at a fixed, eye-level, and level angle, though it remains slightly unsteady. The focus is on the scenery rather than a specific subject. Initially, the scene is dark, with a prominent, gnarled tree silhouetted in the upper left-center middle ground against a grainy green sky, flanked by a line of trees in the background. A light source then flashes on from a low angle, illuminating the lower half of the frame to reveal an unpaved road stretching from the foreground into the middle ground. This light also makes a fence and vegetation visible along the left and center side in the foreground and middle ground, and a small shed appears in the right middle ground next to the trees. The scene is intermittently illuminated, as if by headlights being turned on and off, revealing the road's rough surface, some vegetation, and a fence line along its edges. When the light is on, a small shed is visible near both a prominent, gnarled, leafless tree and a leafy tree, which are further away from the road. In the far background, a wall of trees is silhouetted against the sky. The light source turns on and off, alternately revealing and obscuring the details of the landscape. The emphasis is on the environment and the unsettling feeling of the isolated, dimly lit location rather than a specific object or person. The light source then turns off, returning the scene to its initial dark state where only the silhouettes of the trees are visible.",

    "Camera": "Viewed through the circular frame of what appears to be a night vision scope, the camera is positioned at a fixed, eye-level, and level angle, though it remains slightly unsteady. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire nighttime scene of a rural road and distant trees relatively sharp.",
    "Subject": "This is a rural landscape scenery shot, captured through night vision. There is no main subject because the focus is on the eerie atmosphere created by the night vision and the brief illumination of a desolate, unpaved road. The scene is initially very dark, with the silhouette of a prominent, bare, gnarled tree and a line of other trees visible against a grainy, greenish sky. Headlights then briefly illuminate the road, revealing its rough surface, some vegetation and a fence line along its edges, and a small wooden shed near the trees, before the light extinguishes, returning the scene to near darkness. The emphasis is on the environment and the unsettling feeling of the isolated, dimly lit location rather than a specific object or person.",
    "Motion": "A slightly shaky, night-vision shot captures a rural road and treeline, where a gnarled dead tree, located beside a leafy tree and a wooden shed, stands out against the sky. The scene is intermittently illuminated, as if by headlights being turned on and off.",
    "Scene": "The scene is viewed through a night vision device, casting the entire landscape in a grainy, green monochrome and framed by a dark, circular vignette. The setting is a rural area at night. A light source intermittently flashes, illuminating a dirt road that stretches horizontally in the midground. When the light is on, a small shed is visible near both a prominent, gnarled, leafless tree and a leafy tree, which are further away from the road. A fence line with weeds runs parallel to the dirt road, located beside it. In the far background, a wall of trees is silhouetted against the sky. The light source turns on and off, alternately revealing and obscuring the details of the landscape.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
