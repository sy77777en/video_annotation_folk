  "merged_caption": "In a static wide shot captured from a low angle, a group of sports fans occupies the foreground, filling the lower half of the frame. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping all the fans in the frame sharp. A man in a yellow beanie is positioned in the left-foreground, clapping vigorously, with other fans arranged horizontally to his right across the middle and right foreground, also clapping their hands enthusiastically. Many in the crowd wear yellow beanies, including a man with a goatee in a black collared jacket over a yellow shirt, and a man with a darker skin tone in a black jacket, yellow scarf, and black and yellow cap. Further to the right, a man with long dark hair and glasses wears a yellow beanie, and next to him, another man wears a gray baseball cap and a yellow t-shirt. A woman with blonde hair and a yellow beanie is also in the crowd, clapping and smiling, with another blonde-haired person positioned behind her. They are all looking in the same direction, cheering, with a glass barrier positioned above them where people are watching the match. In the background, a row of large, rectangular glass windows extends across the top half of the frame, set in a light-colored frame. Reflections are visible on the glass, and through it, other people can be seen in a suite, also observing and clapping. The scene is set in a brightly lit stadium, with the modern architectural feature of the windows adding depth to the composition.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
