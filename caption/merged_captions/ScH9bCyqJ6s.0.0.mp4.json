  "merged_caption": "In a static close-up shot, a light-skinned right hand holding a silver-colored metal utility knife occupies the top right foreground, with its sharp, trapezoidal blade extended and hovering above the top edge of a dark-colored foldable smartphone. The smartphone fills the center, bottom, and left portions of the frame in the foreground, with its large display showing a blueish tint and two parallel lines separating different shades of blue. A small circular feature, which appears to be an air bubble, is visible near where the knife is hovering. The left hand is partially visible at the top left and bottom right, securing the phone. The scene takes place on a plain white surface, with the text \"JerryRigE\" appearing as part of an item in the background. The camera is positioned directly above the subjects, providing a high-angle view of the scene and using a shallow depth of field to focus on the foreground where the hand holds the utility knife to the corner of the smartphone screen. A hand slightly adjusts the utility knife above the top edge of the smartphone, with the blade hovering without making contact. The phone is gently held, but both the knife and phone experience slight movements due to natural shifts in hand position. In the top background, a white object is visible behind the hand and phone.",

    "Subject": "A person's light-skinned right hand holds a silver-colored metal utility knife with its sharp, trapezoidal blade extended, hovering above the black top bezel of a dark-colored foldable smartphone, right at the edge of the screen. The phone's large display has a blueish tint with two parallel lines separating different shades of blue. A small circular feature, which appears to be an air bubble, is visible near where the knife is hovering. The left hand holds the smartphone, while the right hand holds the knife.",
    "Motion": "A hand slightly adjusts a utility knife above the top edge of a smartphone, with the blade hovering without making contact. The phone is gently held, but both the knife and phone experience slight movements due to natural shifts in hand position.",
    "Scene": "An overhead POV shot shows a hand holding a silver utility knife, with the blade hovering above the top edge of a dark-colored foldable smartphone. The phone's screen is reflective with a blue tint, and a small, circular, dotted pattern is visible near the top bezel. The scene takes place on a plain white surface, with the text \"JerryRigE\" appearing as part of an item in the background.",
    "Spatial": "In a static close-up shot, a hand holding a silver utility knife occupies the top right foreground, with its blade hovering above the top edge of a smartphone. The smartphone itself fills the center, bottom, and left portions of the frame in the foreground. A second hand is partially visible at the top left and bottom right, securing the phone. In the top background, a white object is visible behind the hand and phone. The camera is positioned directly above the subjects, providing a high-angle view of the scene."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
