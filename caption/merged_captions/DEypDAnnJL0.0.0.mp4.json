  "merged_caption": "A close-up shot frames a woman with light brown skin and curly, light brown hair in the midground of the screen. Initially, a blurred hand is visible in the right foreground, partially obscuring the view before it moves out of the frame to the right. As the hand moves away, the woman's head, which was slightly tilted, straightens to face the camera directly. Her mouth, initially slightly parted, closes slightly as her expression shifts from relaxed to more serious. She is wearing a black turtleneck shirt and small gold hoop earrings, with her hair pulled back and several curly tendrils framing her face. The woman remains centrally positioned throughout the shot. The video takes place indoors in a modern, softly lit living space with neutral-colored walls and large windows adorned with white curtains that allow natural daylight to filter in. In the background, a blue couch and a framed mirror are visible on the left wall, while a dining table and chairs are situated in the right background. The room is minimally decorated, with a modern pendant light hanging above the dining area and a piece of dark furniture against the far right wall. The overall atmosphere is calm and uncluttered, with smooth surfaces and a muted color palette dominated by shades of gray, white, blue, and black. The lighting is diffuse, creating gentle shadows and a subdued ambiance throughout the space. The camera is positioned at the woman's eye level, using a static, level angle with a shallow depth of field that focuses on the woman in the midground and blurs the living room behind her.",

    "Subject": "At the beginning of the video, a woman with light brown skin and curly, light brown hair has her blurred hand near the camera before moving it away. Her head is slightly tilted, and she has a relaxed yet focused expression with her mouth slightly open. She is wearing a black turtleneck shirt and small gold hoop earrings. Her hair is pulled back, with several curly tendrils framing her face. As she moves her hand away, she straightens her head, and her expression becomes more serious, with her mouth closing slightly, though not completely.",

    "Scene": "The video takes place indoors in a modern, softly lit living space with neutral-colored walls and large windows adorned with white curtains that allow natural daylight to filter in. In the background, a dining area is visible against a large window, featuring a rectangular table surrounded by several blue chairs, with a modern pendant light hanging above. The room is minimally decorated, with a framed mirror on the left wall and a blue couch positioned against it, accompanied by a glass door on the far left. On the far right, there is a piece of dark furniture against the wall. The overall atmosphere is calm and uncluttered, with smooth surfaces and a muted color palette dominated by shades of gray, white, blue, and black.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
