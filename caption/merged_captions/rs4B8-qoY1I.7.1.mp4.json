  "merged_caption": "This wide shot, filmed from a high, isometric angle, initially frames a blue, anthropomorphic hedgehog with red and white shoes and a small purple, dinosaur-like creature in the center-left middle ground, next to a large metallic cylindrical structure on the left. The environment is an indoor, industrial-style level with a grid of gray and green tiles, some featuring a circular fan pattern. The hedgehog character transforms into a solid blue sphere and stays in the center middle ground, rolling through the air and collecting several scattered gold rings. The camera smoothly tracks the avatar as it moves downward and to the right across the level, with minor camera shakes occurring when the avatar jumps, adding a subtle immersive effect. Upon reaching the center, the hedgehog uncurls, flies around gathering more rings, and reverts to its hedgehog form, now positioned in the middle ground with a small red, crab-like enemy visible in the top-center background. The character then transforms back into a sphere and spins in place on a small, dark gray pyramidal structure in the center of the frame. The floor features orange, ribbed conduits lining some platform edges, and a blue, glowing button on a pedestal is visible. Overlays are present on the screen: the top-left corner displays the word \"RINGS\" followed by a number, the bottom-left shows a character icon and a number, and the bottom-right features several character icons and other symbols. Throughout the video, game interface elements remain fixed in the top-left, bottom-left, and bottom-right corners, while the hedgehog is accompanied by a green dinosaur-like creature. The game's graphics feature pre-rendered 3D models converted into sprites, giving the characters and environment a distinct, blocky, pseudo-3D appearance.",

    "Camera": "This is a screen recording of a 2.5D isometric video game. The camera smoothly tracks the avatar as it moves downward and to the right across the level. Minor camera shakes occur when the avatar jumps, adding a subtle immersive effect.",
    "Subject": "A blue, anthropomorphic hedgehog with red and white shoes is the central character in a video game presented from an isometric perspective. The hedgehog is accompanied by a small, purple, dinosaur-like creature and a green dinosaur-like creature. The game's graphics feature pre-rendered 3D models converted into sprites, giving the characters and environment a distinct, blocky, pseudo-3D appearance. The hedgehog character is also shown transforming into a solid blue sphere. Other elements in the scene include scattered gold rings and a small, red, crab-like enemy.",
    "Motion": "A blue hedgehog, accompanied by a small purple creature, curls into a solid blue sphere. The sphere rolls through the air, collecting several gold rings. It then uncurls, and the hedgehog flies around, gathering more rings. Finally, the hedgehog transforms back into a sphere and bounces in place on a small, dark pyramid.",
    "Scene": "A third-person isometric (2.5D) gaming video with a tilted overhead angle showing the environment in a three-quarters perspective reveals an indoor, industrial-style level. The floor consists of a grid of gray and green tiles, with many of the gray tiles featuring a circular fan pattern. On the left, a large, metallic, cylindrical structure has a yellow sign with a black triangle on it. Orange, ribbed conduits line some of the platform edges, and golden rings are scattered across the floor. In the center of the area, a small, dark gray pyramidal structure and a blue, glowing button on a pedestal are also visible. Overlays are present on the screen: the top-left corner displays the word \"RINGS\" followed by a number, the bottom-left shows a character icon and a number, and the bottom-right features several character icons and other symbols.",
    "Spatial": "This wide shot, filmed from a high, isometric angle, initially frames a blue hedgehog character and a purple creature in the center-left middle ground, next to a large cylindrical structure on the left.

Upon reaching the center, it reverts to its hedgehog form, now positioned in the middle ground with a small red enemy visible in the top-center background.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
