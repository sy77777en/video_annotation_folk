  "merged_caption": "From a first-person perspective looking downwards, the person's arms and hands occupy the bottom half of the frame in the foreground. The left hand initially holds a reddish-brown, rectangular brick in the bottom center of the frame, while the right hand holds a trowel in the bottom right. Their lower body, wearing a light-colored long-sleeve shirt, patterned shorts, and sandals, is also visible in the bottom center. A bucket containing mortar is positioned in the left bottom middle ground. A partially constructed brick wall is in the middle ground, initially in the upper left and later shifting to the right side of the frame. Greenery and rocks are visible in the background, starting in the upper left corner and moving to the top and then the upper right corner due to camera movement. At the beginning, several steps and white lines are visible in the middle ground on the right side of the frame. The video starts with a bird's-eye view and transitions to an upside-down high-angle shot, indicating a first-person, head-mounted perspective. The camera is at eye level and uses deep focus with a large depth of field. It captures a first-person POV, rolling counterclockwise as the person turns left to place a brick on the wall. After the roll, the camera moves slightly downward. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking. The person, whose arms and hands are visible and have a darker skin tone, walks towards a partially constructed wall made of similar bricks. The person positions the brick on the wall, aligning it with the existing structure. They then press the brick into place, ensuring it is secure. The background includes a construction site with a bucket of mortar, some greenery, and scattered construction materials. The lighting is bright, indicating clear weather.",

    "Scene": "The video presents a first-person POV shot of an outdoor construction site during the day. The setting features a partially built brick wall with red bricks stacked evenly. The ground is a mix of concrete and dirt, with a bucket of mortar nearby. A trowel and some string are visible, indicating ongoing construction work. The scene includes a glimpse of greenery in the background, suggesting a natural environment surrounding the site. The lighting is bright, indicating clear weather.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
