  "merged_caption": "This wide shot is framed from a camera fixed directly below a person, whose head and upper torso remain stationary in the top-center foreground. The person, wearing a lime-green garment with two blue zippers and a black helmet strap visible across their chin, glides steadily forward through a deep gorge, maintaining a stable, face-down position. The camera, positioned at the person's waist, captures the view with noticeable, unsteady shaking and a varying Dutch angle as it rolls slightly. The footage, filmed with mild barrel distortion and deep focus, shows steep, forested cliffs positioned in the middle ground on the left and right sides of the frame. Below them, in the center middle ground, a valley floor with fields and a town is visible. A large mountain range extends across the background, with a clear blue sky filling the upper portion of the frame. The perspective glides forward high above a deep mountain valley, revealing steep cliffs covered in dense, dark green forests that descend into a gorge. In the distance, a wider valley floor features green fields, a small town, and a road, all set against a backdrop of a massive mountain range with grey, rocky peaks. The entire scene takes place on a clear day under a bright blue sky. The camera remains stationary relative to the person, creating a stable frame through which the vast landscape glides past, capturing the expansive mountain landscape that remains sharp and in view.",

    "Camera": "This video is shot from an aerial perspective, capturing the view of a wingsuit flyer with the camera positioned at the person's waist. The footage shows the flyer appearing above the camera, moving forward with noticeable, unsteady shaking and a varying Dutch angle as it rolls slightly. Filmed with mild barrel distortion and deep focus, the expansive mountain landscape remains sharp and in view.",
    "Subject": "The video features a person, seen from a camera positioned directly below them. The person is oriented face down, with their upper torso and chin visible at the top of the frame. They are wearing a lime-green garment, possibly a wingsuit or jacket, which has two blue zippers running down the middle. The person's chin shows short, light brown beard, and a black strap from helmet is visible across it.",
    "Motion": "From a camera's perspective positioned directly below, a person in a wingsuit glides steadily forward through the air. They maintain a stable, face-down position as they soar over a vast, forested mountain valley.",
    "Scene": "From a locked-on POV shot, the perspective glides forward high above a deep mountain valley. The chin of a person and a portion of a yellow wingsuit with two blue zippers are visible at the top of the frame. Below, the landscape unfolds, revealing steep cliffs covered in dense, dark green forests that descend into a gorge. In the distance, a wider valley floor features green fields, a small town, and a road, all set against a backdrop of a massive mountain range with grey, rocky peaks. The entire scene takes place on a clear day under a bright blue sky.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
