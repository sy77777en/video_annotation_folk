  "merged_caption": "The scene begins with a focus on a blonde woman in the left middle ground, wearing a red long-sleeved top, a white skirt, and a glowing blue necklace, holding a light green and transparent elongated object. As she directs it towards the man in the center middle ground, water suddenly sprays onto him, hitting his black suit and face. The man, dressed in a black suit, white shirt, and dark patterned tie, reacts with a startled expression, now visibly wet, and looks towards the woman with a surprised expression while fiddling with a black and white plush toy in his hand. The woman immediately brings her hand to her mouth and laughs. The shot transitions to a medium shot, highlighting the woman and the man in the center, while the man on the right, also in a black suit and white shirt with short dark hair and a light beard, is temporarily excluded from the frame. He gestures with his hand while speaking and recoils, leaning back with a surprised facial expression, simultaneously turning to face another direction. A table displaying pet tech gadgets, including a white and blue cylindrical device and a white rectangular dispenser with a wooden lid, occupies the foreground. A large screen displaying a bright daytime cityscape with a prominent palm tree forms the background. The man on the right reappears at the conclusion of the video. Graphic overlays, including a \"PET TECH\" banner with \"GADGETS TO TRACK & ENTERTAIN YOUR FURRY FRIENDS\" and a \"9\" logo, are visible in the bottom corners of the frame. The camera is positioned at eye level, maintaining a level angle with deep focus, ensuring all elements are sharp. It initially remains stationary, focused on three people, then quickly moves forward to focus on two of them as they talk, with generally smooth movement and minimal shaking.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at eye level, maintaining a level angle. It employs a deep focus, ensuring a large depth of field where all elements are sharp. The handheld camera initially remains stationary, focused on three people. During the video, it quickly moves forward to focus on two of them as they talk. The camera movement is generally smooth with minimal shaking.",
    "Subject": "A blonde woman, wearing a red long-sleeved top, a white skirt, and a glowing blue necklace, is positioned on the left. She holds an elongated object, with the upper part being light green and the lower part transparent, and is depicted laughing with her hand covering her mouth, following an apparent discharge of water from the object. In the center, a man dressed in a black suit, white shirt, and a dark patterned tie, holds a small black and white stuffed animal; water is visible on his suit and face, and he has a surprised expression. To his right, a second man, also in a black suit and white shirt, with short dark hair and a light beard, reacts with an expression of surprise and amusement, leaning back slightly. Several pet tech gadgets are displayed on a table before them, notably a white and blue cylindrical device and a white rectangular dispenser with a wooden lid.",
    "Motion": "The man on the right gestures with his hand while speaking. The woman on the left holds a light green and transparent elongated object. As she handles this object, water suddenly sprays from it, hitting the man in the center on his suit and face. The man on the right recoils, leaning back with a surprised facial expression, and simultaneously turns to face another direction. The woman immediately brings her hand to her mouth and laughs. The man in the center, now visibly wet, looks towards the woman with a surprised expression. While doing so, he fiddles with a black and white plush toy in his hand, frowning slightly and speaking to the woman with a wry smile.",
    "Scene": "A television broadcast-style viewpoint shows an indoor studio setting. In the background, a large screen displays a bright daytime cityscape with a prominent palm tree. In the foreground, a white table holds several pet tech gadgets: a white and teal cylindrical device, a white rectangular object with a wooden lid, and a white circular water fountain. On the far left, a blonde woman holds a small, teal, elongated object from which a white foamy substance, identified as water, has just sprayed. In the center, a man in a dark suit is reacting to the spray, while on the far right, another person stands. Overlay elements include a \"Today\" logo with the time \"8:55\" displayed beneath it, and a banner in the lower left with \"PET TECH\" in dark blue text on a white background on the top line, and \"GADGETS TO TRACK & ENTERTAIN YOUR FURRY FRIENDS\" in smaller white text on a dark blue background on the bottom line. A yellow \"9\" logo is visible in the lower right.",
    "Spatial": "The scene begins with a focus on the woman in the left middle ground, holding a light green object, as she directs it towards the man in the center middle ground, causing water to spray onto him.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
