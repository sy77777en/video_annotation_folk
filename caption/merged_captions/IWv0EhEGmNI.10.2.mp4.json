  "merged_caption": "This is a slightly shaky, first-person perspective shot with subtle horizontal and vertical movements, filmed from a low, eye-level angle. The camera, representing the player holding a modern firearm with a scope and laser attachment, moves smoothly with minimal shaking, frequently panning slightly left and right and tilting downward to survey the surroundings. In the foreground, the rifle is positioned in the bottom center of the frame, with dark, out-of-focus structures framing the view on the left and right sides. The laser attachment turns off a few seconds into the video. In the middle ground, a large, dense bush is positioned towards the center-left, and a low wall made of rough, uneven stones is located in the center. The background is completely dark, rendered in the monochromatic green of night vision. Several digital overlays are present on the screen: an ammo counter is in the bottom right, a battery indicator is in the bottom left, a vertical bar is on the left side, and subtitles are at the bottom center, displaying dialogue with the character's name highlighted in red. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp with a large depth of field.",

    "Camera": "This first-person video game perspective is filmed from a low, eye-level angle. The camera, representing the player holding a rifle, moves smoothly with minimal shaking, frequently panning to the right and tilting downward to survey the surroundings. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp with a large depth of field.",
    "Subject": "A first-person perspective from a video game is shown through a green-tinted night-vision scope. The viewer is holding a modern firearm, with its scope and a laser attachment visible in the lower portion of the view, which turns off a few seconds into the video. In the distance, a low, rough-hewn stone wall stands next to a dark, leafy bush. Digital interface elements are overlaid on the scene, including an ammo counter in the bottom right corner, additional overlays at the bottom left and the center of the screen, and a subtitle at the bottom of the screen.",
    "Motion": "From a first-person perspective, the viewpoint pans slightly left and right, with some minor up-and-down movement, while aimed at a distant stone wall and a bush.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, looks out from a narrow, dark space at night, with the entire scene rendered in the monochromatic green of night vision. The perspective is framed by dark structures on the left and right, with the character's rifle visible in the foreground. Directly ahead, a large, dense bush stands next to a low wall made of rough, uneven stones. Several overlays are present on the screen: white subtitles at the bottom display dialogue with the character's name highlighted in red, while a heads-up display shows a vertical bar on the left, an ammunition count with weapon icons on the right, and a battery level indicator located at the bottom left of the screen.",
    "Spatial": "This is a slightly shaky, first-person perspective shot with subtle horizontal and vertical movements. In the foreground, a rifle with a scope is positioned in the bottom center of the frame, with dark, out-of-focus structures framing the view on the left and right sides. In the middle ground, a large bush is positioned towards the center-left, and a low brick wall is located in the center. The background is completely dark. Several digital overlays are present on the screen: an ammo counter is in the bottom right, a battery indicator is in the bottom left, a vertical bar is on the left side, and subtitles are at the bottom center. The camera is positioned at the character's eye level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
