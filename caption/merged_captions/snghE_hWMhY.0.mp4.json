  "merged_caption": "In a full shot, a tall, slender rocket stands vertically in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground against a dark night sky. The rocket's main body is painted in sections of white and a light blue-green color, topped by a white nose cone. Several smaller, white solid rocket boosters are attached to the lower part of the main stage. Bright spotlights are visible in the middle ground to the left and right of the rocket, with additional, more distant lights in the background on the right. A dark structure is partially visible in the foreground at the bottom left. Throughout the shot, the rocket remains stationary while a steady plume of white vapor continuously vents from its base at the bottom center of the frame, creating a small cloud that drifts in the darkness. Intermittent plumes of white vapor vent from its lower section, while a continuous stream of smoke rises from off-screen at the bottom. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, maintaining a static, low-angle shot with deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. Bright spotlights from the ground and nearby towers illuminate the vehicle, while other lights are visible in the distant background.",

    "Camera": "This is a static, low-angle shot of a rocket on its launchpad. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "A tall, slender rocket stands vertically in the center of the view against a black night sky. The rocket's main body is painted in sections of white and a light blue-green color, topped by a white nose cone. Several smaller, white solid rocket boosters are attached to the lower part of the main stage. Throughout the video, a steady plume of white vapor vents from the base of the stationary rocket.",
    "Motion": "A tall rocket stands motionless on its launchpad against the night sky, as intermittent plumes of white vapor vent from its lower section, while a continuous stream of smoke rises from off-screen at the bottom.",
    "Scene": "A tall, slender rocket stands vertically on a launchpad against a black night sky. The rocket is primarily white with a greenish-blue section on its upper half and features a pointed nose cone. Bright spotlights from the ground and nearby towers illuminate the vehicle, while other lights are visible in the distant background. White vapor continuously vents from the base of the rocket, creating a small cloud that drifts in the darkness.",
    "Spatial": "In a full shot, a tall rocket stands vertically in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground against a dark background.

A dark structure is partially visible in the foreground at the bottom left.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
