  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot, captured from the subject's level, in a mystical, dark forest setting. A large, luminous blue-white orb is positioned in the center of the frame in the middle ground, encased within a dark, swirling, vine-like structure, emitting powerful beams of blue-white light. A small, bipedal creature, entirely white and glowing with long ears and a slender body, is present on a platform slightly below and to the left of the orb. The scene is framed by gnarled tree branches in the foreground and middle ground, with misty, purple-blue clouds at the bottom and waterfalls cascading in the background. The air is filled with floating, glowing particles. An achievement notification is overlaid in the top-left corner, reading \"ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED RUN FOR YOUR LIFE,\" and a heads-up display with various icons is visible at the bottom center. The small white creature jumps upwards and to the right, gliding through the air alongside the nearby glowing blue orb. The camera maintains a level angle as it tracks the creature's upward movement, moving with a mix of pauses and bursts of speed, though the tracking is slightly unsteady with some noticeable shakiness. The creature initially moves towards the upper right corner of the frame, then ascends rapidly in a vertical direction along the right side. Subsequently, it moves towards the upper left corner, landing on a higher branch near the center in the middle ground, and continues to jump back and forth upwards. The ground is composed of floating platforms, enhancing the mystical atmosphere of the forest environment.",

    "Camera": "This is a side-view shot from a video game, where the camera maintains a level angle as it tracks a small, glowing character. The camera follows the character's upward movement as it jumps, moving with a mix of pauses and bursts of speed. The tracking is slightly unsteady, with some noticeable shakiness.",
    "Subject": "In a mystical, dark forest setting, a large, luminous blue-white orb is encased within a dark, swirling, vine-like structure, emitting powerful beams of blue-white light. A small, bipedal creature, entirely white and glowing with long ears and a slender body, is present.",
    "Motion": "In a 2D game scene, a large, luminous blue-white orb pulses with light. A small, glowing white creature jumps upwards from a platform, gliding through the air alongside the nearby glowing blue orb. Initially, it moves towards the upper right corner of the frame, then ascends rapidly in a vertical direction along the right side. Subsequently, it moves towards the upper left corner, landing on a tree, and continues to jump back and forth upwards.",
    "Scene": "In a side-view gaming video, the scene is set within a dark, mystical forest environment. Gnarled, dark tree branches and trunks dominate the landscape, framing a central, large, glowing blue orb that pulsates with purple light and is encased in a thorny, cage-like structure. The ground is composed of floating platforms amidst misty, purple-blue clouds, with waterfalls cascading in the background. A small, white, glowing creature is seen on a platform. The air is filled with floating, glowing particles. Overlays are present on the screen: a notification in the top-left corner reads \"ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED RUN FOR YOUR LIFE,\" and a heads-up display with various icons is visible at the bottom center.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a wide shot, captured from the subject's level.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
