  "merged_caption": "In a high-angle full shot, a long, dark rectangular table extends from the bottom foreground toward the right middle ground, featuring a grid pattern with white rectangular objects and a red glow emanating from beneath it in the bottom center foreground. In the middle ground, a group of brown-colored figures, primarily men in military-style uniforms with hats, and one distinguished by a red uniform and hat, stand around the table. Other brown figures are positioned in the foreground at the bottom of the frame, facing the table. Initially appearing as an amorphous shape in the center-left foreground, a blue, particle-like figure solidifies and disintegrates into particles, then reappears at a dark doorway on the far left, taking the form of a man who appears to be running, although he remains stationary, in the process of exiting the scene but not actually leaving. The camera, from a high, overhead angle, performs a smooth, complex movement, tilting and rolling as it examines the room filled with these stylized human figures, maintaining a deep focus to keep all the figures and the environment sharp. The scene is dimly lit, with the red glow providing a stark contrast to the dark setting, enhancing the textured, brown material rendering of the figures, which appear to be miniature statues or figurines. The blue figure's transformation and the camera's dynamic movement reveal the larger group of stationary figures, emphasizing the spatial relationships and the enclosed nature of the space.",

    "Camera": "From a high, overhead angle, the camera performs a smooth, complex movement, tilting and rolling as it examines a room filled with stylized human figures. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping all the figures and the environment sharp.",
    "Subject": "The video features multiple figures, primarily men, in a dark setting. Most of the men are rendered in a textured, brown material, wearing military-style uniforms with hats. One man is distinguished by his red uniform and hat. A single figure, also a man, is rendered in blue and is seen walking away from the group through a doorway. In the center, there is a large, dark rectangular table with a grid pattern, on which white rectangular objects are placed, around which some of the men are gathered.",
    "Motion": "A blue, particle-like figure initially stands in front of a long table and disintegrates into particles. It then reappears at a dark doorway, taking the form of a man who appears to be running, although he remains stationary. As the blue figure transforms, the camera moves with a complex combination of tilting and rolling actions, revealing a larger group of stationary figures, mostly brown with one in red, standing around the table.",
    "Scene": "The video presents an overhead view of a dark, enclosed space where numerous figures stand around a rectangular table. The figures, primarily rendered in shades of brown, appear to be miniature statues or figurines. One figure, colored blue, stands apart from the rest, seemingly moving away from the group. The table features a grid-like pattern in the center, where a few white rectangular objects are placed. The scene is dimly lit, with a red glow emanating from beneath the table.",
    "Spatial": "In a high-angle full shot, a long, dark table extends from the bottom foreground toward the right middle ground. In the middle ground, a group of brown-colored figures and one red figure are standing around the table, while other brown figures are positioned in the foreground at the bottom of the frame, facing the table. A grid pattern with white objects sits on the table in the right middle ground, and a red glow emanates from beneath the table in the bottom center foreground. Initially appearing as an amorphous shape in the center-left foreground, a blue figure solidifies and moves upward towards a dark doorway on the far left, in the process of exiting the scene but not actually leaving."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
