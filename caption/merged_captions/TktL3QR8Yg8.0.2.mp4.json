  "merged_caption": "The camera rotates clockwise around a person with light skin, capturing their hands drawing on a piece of paper on the floor. The right hand, centrally located, moves a dark, thick crayon or charcoal stick back and forth across the paper, while the left hand, resting on the right side of the frame, holds the paper steady. The person's upper body and the lower part of their face, from the nose down, are positioned in the upper right and center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. They are wearing a light-colored, long-sleeved shirt with thin, dark vertical stripes. The camera smoothly arcs around this ground-level, level-angle shot with a shallow depth of field focused on the person's hands in the midground. Several other small, dark drawing implements are scattered across the bottom of the frame in the immediate foreground, alongside a blurry black object with rectangular holes on the left side. The softly blurred background, visible in the upper left, features windows and a carousel-like figurine, adding depth and interest to the warmly lit indoor setting. The person remains leaned over their work, with their body and head held still throughout the action, concentrating intently on their drawing.",

    "Camera": "This is a ground-level, level-angle shot with a shallow depth of field focused on the person's hands in the midground. The camera smoothly arcs clockwise around the person as they draw on the floor.",
    "Subject": "A person with light skin is shown in a close-up, kneeling on the floor and leaning forward as they concentrate on a drawing. They are wearing a light-colored, long-sleeved shirt with thin, dark vertical stripes. Leaning over a piece of paper, they firmly grip a dark, thick crayon or charcoal stick in their right hand, while their left hand holds the paper steady. Only the lower part of their face, from the nose down, is visible as they look down intently at their work.",
    "Motion": "A person's right hand moves a dark crayon back and forth across a piece of paper on the floor, while their left hand holds the paper steady. The person remains leaned over their work, with their body and head held still throughout the action.",
    "Scene": "In a warmly lit indoor setting, a person wearing a striped shirt leans close to a piece of paper resting on a carpeted floor. Their hand grips a dark, stick-like crayon, moving it across the paper to draw. Several other small, dark drawing implements are scattered on the floor around the paper. The softly blurred background features windows and a carousel-like figurine, adding depth and interest to the scene.",
    "Spatial": "The camera rotates clockwise around the subject, capturing a person's hands drawing on a piece of paper. The right hand, holding a dark drawing tool, is centrally located, while the left hand rests on the right side of the frame, holding the paper steady. The person's upper body and the lower part of their face are positioned in the upper right and center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. Several drawing implements are scattered across the bottom of the frame in the immediate foreground, alongside a blurry black object with rectangular holes on the left side.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
