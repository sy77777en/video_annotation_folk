  "merged_caption": "This is a static, full shot from a top-down perspective, filmed from a static, bird's-eye view, looking directly down at the scene. A miniature, dark blue rolling suitcase is positioned on the right side of the frame, lying flat in the foreground against a background of light-colored, vertical wooden slats that fill the entire scene. The suitcase features a top shaped like an arched trapezoid and has two rectangular pockets on its front, each with a two-tone design: the lower section is a light grayish-blue, and the upper flap is a darker grayish-blue. The flaps are highlighted with prominent white stitching and a small, silver zipper pull for added detail. On either side of the bottom, small wheels are visible. The object appears to be a handmade model, possibly constructed from fabric or a similar textured material. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping all elements sharp and clear. The composition remains unchanged throughout the video, with the miniature rolling suitcase remaining stationary on the wooden surface. The suitcase transitions from half-open to fully closed, maintaining its position on the right side of the frame. The wooden surface has a cool-toned, weathered texture, and the overall color scheme of the suitcase includes dark blue and grayish-blue hues.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
