  "merged_caption": "In a wide, overhead shot, a black SUV is positioned in the center-left of the frame, with a white police car to its right in the center-right. Both vehicles are in the middle ground, situated on a city street to the right of a central intersection. Buildings frame the scene at the top left, top right, and bottom of the screen. Overlay text labels are positioned below each vehicle, with \"PILOT CAR\" under the SUV and \"ROUTE CAR\" under the police car. As the shot progresses, both cars drive from left to right in a single file, moving through the intersection. From an aerial perspective, the black SUV and the white police car travel in close succession on a city street, with the police car slightly ahead. Both vehicles move at a consistent speed as they pass through an intersection. The camera moves smoothly to the right, while the overlay text remains in the same position within the frame, moving rightward along with the vehicles. The video, filmed by a drone, provides an overhead view of a city street intersection during the day. The gray asphalt roads are marked with white dashed lines and crosswalks. The intersection is flanked by multi-story buildings, one dark gray and another light gray, with a tan-colored building in the foreground. The black SUV, identified by a white label with blue text that reads \"PILOT CAR,\" is following behind the white police car, which is labeled \"ROUTE CAR.\" The police car has blue \"NYPD\" lettering on its side and the number \"6005\" on its trunk. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
