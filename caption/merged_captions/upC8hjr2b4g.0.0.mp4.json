  "merged_caption": "A full shot, filmed from a high angle, captures a disclaimer printed on a white newspaper positioned in the foreground, filling most of the frame. The word \"DISCLAIMER\" is located at the top center, with the main warning text directly below it in the center of the frame, reading: \"THIS VIDEO DISCUSSES SUICIDE, VIOLENCE, AND ABUSE INFLICTED UPON CHILDREN. PLEASE TAKE CARE WHEN WATCHING.\" The paper, slightly wrinkled and draped, casts soft shadows and appears to be placed on a table with a wood-grain pattern, visible at the bottom of the frame. Partially visible columns of smaller, less legible text are positioned on the left and right sides of the central message, resembling the layout of a newspaper. The scene is cast in a cool, blue light, suggesting dim, nighttime lighting. The camera captures a bird's-eye view of the newspaper on the table, looking down from above. Using a deep focus, the entire newspaper remains sharp as the camera performs a very smooth and slow zoom-in on the text. While there is no physical movement from the camera or the subject, the zoom-in emphasizes the disclaimer during the clip.",

    "Camera": "The camera captures a bird's-eye view of a newspaper on a table, looking down from above. Using a deep focus, the entire newspaper remains sharp as the camera performs a very smooth and slow zoom-in on the text.",
    "Subject": "A close-up view shows a disclaimer printed on a white surface, which appears to be a banner or a large sheet of paper placed on a table with a wood grain pattern. The scene is cast in a cool, blue light. At the top, the word \"DISCLAIMER\" is written in a large, black, all-caps serif font. A solid black horizontal line separates the title from the body of the text below, which reads, \"THIS VIDEO DISCUSSES SUICIDE, VIOLENCE, AND ABUSE INFLICTED UPON CHILDREN. PLEASE TAKE CARE WHEN WATCHING.\" To the left and right of this central message, other columns of smaller, less legible text are partially visible.",
    "Motion": "The video features a static, close-up shot of a disclaimer printed on a piece of paper. While there is no physical movement from the camera or the subject, the camera does zoom in on the disclaimer during the clip.",
    "Scene": "A close-up, static shot focuses on a white paper banner with black text, set against a cool, blue-toned background that suggests dim, nighttime lighting. The word \"DISCLAIMER\" is printed in a large, bold, serif font across the top. Below it, a warning reads: \"THIS VIDEO DISCUSSES SUICIDE, VIOLENCE, AND ABUSE INFLICTED UPON CHILDREN. PLEASE TAKE CARE WHEN WATCHING.\" The paper, slightly wrinkled and draped, casts soft shadows and appears to be placed on a table with a wood-grain pattern. Faint, out-of-focus columns of smaller text are visible on either side of the central message, resembling the layout of a newspaper.",
    "Spatial": "A full shot, filmed from a high angle, captures a disclaimer printed on a white newspaper. The newspaper is positioned in the foreground, filling most of the frame. The word \"DISCLAIMER\" is located at the top center, with the main warning text directly below it in the center of the frame. The paper is draped over a surface visible at the bottom of the frame. Partially visible columns of text are positioned on the left and right sides of the central message. The shot zooms in, but all elements in the frame remain static."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
