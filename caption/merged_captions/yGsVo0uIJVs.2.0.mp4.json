  "merged_caption": "The scene begins with an overhead medium shot, showing the backs of three low-polygon figures in teal uniforms and hats, positioned at the bottom left, bottom right, and bottom center of the frame. They face a large, weathered green control console that occupies the middle ground, featuring various gauges, a joystick, and panels of colored buttons with labels like \"Add power\" and \"Button.\" A large, grid-lined screen is centered on the console, initially displaying a dark silhouette of the west coast of North America. From a high-angle, overhead perspective, the camera smoothly moves forward and down, tilting to focus on the central screen of the control panel. This motion transitions the view from an overhead height to eye-level, while maintaining a deep focus that keeps the entire console sharp. As the camera executes a slow zoom-in, expanding white circles, resembling radar sweeps, appear across the display, especially when the console displays the Pacific Ocean. Multiple circles individually expand and then fade away. The zoom continues, transitioning into a close-up that fills the frame with the screen. As the view tightens, the white circles sweep across the section of the console display that shows the Pacific Ocean. The sweeps fade, replaced by a small, stationary red dot, outlined by a white ring, appearing slightly to the left of the center.",

    "Subject": "Three low-polygon figures are seen from behind, positioned in front of a large, weathered green control console. Each figure wears a matching teal-colored hat and uniform. The console features various buttons and a large central screen that initially displays a gridded map with a silhouette of the west coast of North America. As the view zooms in on the screen, white circular lines, resembling a radar sweep, appear and move across the display. The focus tightens until a small, solid red dot, encircled by a white ring, appears in the center-left of the screen.",
    "Motion": "The view zooms in on a large screen on a control console. Expanding white circles, resembling radar sweeps, appear across the display. Multiple circles individually expand and then fade away, especially when the console displays the Pacific Ocean. As the view continues to zoom, a solid red dot appears, encircled by a white ring, positioned at the center-left of the screen.",
    "Scene": "From an objective viewpoint, the scene is set inside a vintage-style control room, where three low-poly figures in teal uniforms and hats face a large, greenish-gray metal console. The console features various gauges, a joystick, and panels of colored buttons with labels like \"Add power\" and \"Button.\" At the center is a large, grid-lined screen initially displaying a dark silhouette of the west coast of North America. During the sequence, white, circular sonar-like sweeps expand across the screen. The view then zooms in on the screen as the sweeps fade, replaced by a small, red, circular target with a white outline appearing slightly to the left of the center.",
    "Spatial": "The scene begins with an overhead medium shot, showing the backs of three figures in the foreground, positioned at the bottom left, bottom right, and bottom center of the frame. They face a large control console that occupies the middle ground. A large screen is centered on the console, displaying a map. The camera then executes a slow zoom-in, focusing on the central screen. As the view tightens, white circles sweep across the section of the console display that shows the Pacific Ocean.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
