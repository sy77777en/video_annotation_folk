  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a high-angle close-up shot of a hand with a light skin tone in the center-right foreground placing a small, black digital voice recorder, which is already on with a small red light illuminated and the digital screen displaying a running timer, in the center of the frame onto a smooth, light-colored surface. The hand then retracts toward the top right and exits the frame. As the hand pulls away, leaving the activated recorder stationary on the surface, the camera subtly zooms in on the recorder, performing a slight counterclockwise rolling motion. The shot transitions to a wider full shot, leaving the recorder positioned in the center of the frame on the surface, which now occupies the middle ground. A dark object is visible in the bottom-left foreground, while the camera maintains its fixed high-angle position throughout. The dimly lit scene in a dark room highlights the illuminated small screen of the device, displaying white text and numbers, as it sits alone on the tabletop in the dim light.",

    "Scene": "In a dark room, a hand reaches into the frame and places a small, black digital voice recorder onto a smooth, light-colored surface. The device's small screen is illuminated, displaying white text and numbers. After setting it down, the hand withdraws, leaving the active recorder sitting alone on the tabletop in the dim light.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
