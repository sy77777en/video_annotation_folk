  "merged_caption": "Initially, a medium full shot frames the main subject, a man in a green and yellow shirt with \"ZINK\" and \"Troy Lee Designs\" printed on it, in the center-left foreground, partially facing towards the right. A pregnant woman with long blonde hair, wearing a light grey beanie, a black top under an open blue zip-up hoodie, and grey pants, stands in the center-right middle ground, interacting with him. Another man with a black t-shirt, black baseball cap, sunglasses, and a large grey and black backpack is positioned in the right middle ground, slightly behind her. A medium-sized brown dog on a leash is visible in the bottom middle ground. In the more distant middle ground, two other women stand on a dirt path that extends from the foreground, with reddish-brown rocky hills occupying the background. The scene unfolds in a rugged, arid landscape characterized by sparse, dry vegetation under a bright, white sky. Initially, the camera angle is high, looking down, but it transitions to a level angle due to camera movement. The man in the green and yellow shirt initially faces the pregnant woman, engaging in conversation. He then turns his back to the camera and walks away from the group, moving up a slight incline on the dirt path. As he turns, the shot transitions to a medium shot, focusing on his upper body from behind, and the pregnant woman is now positioned in the left middle ground, turning slightly to watch him depart. The handheld camera intermittently pans to the right, and its movement is smooth with minimal shaking. The brown dog walks in the opposite direction to the man as he moves away. Behind the pregnant woman, the man with a backpack remains relatively still. In the background, two other women stand on the path; one gestures while they converse.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at eye level. Initially, the camera angle is high, looking down, but it transitions to a level angle due to camera movement. A shallow depth of field is employed, with the camera focused on the man in the green and yellow jersey in the foreground. The handheld camera intermittently pans to the right, and its movement is smooth with minimal shaking.",
    "Subject": "The main subject is a man with short brown hair and a beard, wearing a green and yellow long-sleeved athletic shirt with \"ZINK\" in yellow lettering on the back and \"Troy Lee Designs\" on the sleeve. He has goggles with a red and white strap around his neck. He is interacting with a pregnant woman who has long blonde hair and is wearing a light grey beanie, a black top under an open blue zip-up hoodie, and grey pants. Standing behind the pregnant woman is another man wearing a black t-shirt, a black baseball cap, sunglasses, and a large grey and black backpack. A medium-sized brown dog on a leash is visible near the group. Further in the background, two other women are standing on a dirt path; one wears a black top and grey jeans, and the other wears a dark top, light green pants, and a green cap.",
    "Motion": "The man in the green and yellow shirt initially faces a pregnant woman, engaging in conversation. He then turns his back to the camera and walks away from the group, moving up a slight incline on the dirt path. The pregnant woman, who was standing and talking to him, turns slightly to watch him depart. A brown dog on a leash, initially near the group, walks in the opposite direction to the man as he moves away. Behind the pregnant woman, another man with a backpack remains relatively still.

    "Scene": "The scene unfolds in a rugged, arid landscape characterized by reddish-brown, rocky hills and sparse, dry vegetation under a bright, white sky. A dirt path winds through the terrain, where a group of people are gathered. In the foreground, a man in a bright green and yellow long-sleeved jersey with \"ZINK\" and \"Troy Lee Designs\" printed on it is slightly turned towards the camera before turning his back to it, with goggles resting on the back of his neck. A pregnant woman in a blue zip-up hoodie, grey pants, and a light-colored beanie stands near him, along with another man wearing a black t-shirt, a black cap, and a backpack. A brown dog on a leash is also present. Further back, two other women are visible on the path, and in the distance, more people can be seen on the higher elevations of the rocky formations. The overall impression is of an outdoor, natural setting, likely a mountainous terrain, with a focus on the interaction between the individuals and the expansive, earthy-toned environment.",
    "Spatial": "Initially, a medium full shot frames the main subject, a man in a green and yellow shirt, in the center-left foreground, partially facing towards the right. A pregnant woman stands in the center-right middle ground, interacting with him, while another man with a backpack is positioned in the right middle ground, slightly behind her. A brown dog is visible in the bottom middle ground. In the more distant middle ground, two other women stand on a dirt path that extends from the foreground, with reddish-brown rocky hills occupying the background. As the main subject turns his back to the camera, he moves to the center foreground, and the shot transitions to a medium shot, focusing on his upper body from behind. Consequently, the pregnant woman is now positioned in the left middle ground. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the scene."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
