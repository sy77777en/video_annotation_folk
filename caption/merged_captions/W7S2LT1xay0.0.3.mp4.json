  "merged_caption": "The wide shot is fixed on a car door, with the front of the white vehicle positioned in the bottom left middle ground against a white, paneled garage door in the background. The car's side mirror is in the center, with the tan interior occupying the right middle ground. This slow-motion, eye-level shot is captured by a camera mounted on a car door. The camera's movement is smooth as it first arcs slightly clockwise and then counterclockwise, following the motion of the door as it closes. As the door swings shut, the garage door and a passing brick wall in the background blur and exit the frame from the right. The front of the car also moves out of the bottom left. The shot settles with the door closed, positioning the side mirror in the center of the frame and the car's interior on the right. A faint and indistinct reflection of a person's face briefly appears in the center of the mirror, which now reflects the static background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, maintaining a deep focus that keeps both the car and the garage door in the background sharp throughout the shot. The video highlights a white sedan, with the camera focused on the car's door, capturing both the interior and exterior. The door features a black side mirror and is attached to a car with a tan or light brown interior. The locked-on POV shot captures the static vehicle at night, with the camera mounted on the door, focusing on the black side mirror, reflecting the dimly lit surroundings. The footage shows the white, paneled garage door and a brick wall moving past with motion blur, offering a detailed view of both the car's interior and its surroundings.",

The door features a black side mirror and is attached to a car with a tan or light brown interior. As the door swings shut, a faint and indistinct reflection of a person's face briefly appears in the side mirror, showing the front of the face, but no other specific details are discernible.",
    "Motion": "The camera is mounted on the door of a stationary white car, capturing both the interior and exterior views. The video begins with the door moving in a slight clockwise arc, followed by a counterclockwise arc, as the door closes. The garage door, brick wall, and outdoor scenery are visible in the background during the motion.",
    "Scene": "A locked-on POV shot captures the static vehicle at night. The camera, mounted on the door, focuses on the black side mirror, reflecting the dimly lit surroundings. The footage shows the white, paneled garage door and a brick wall moving past with motion blur. The car's tan interior, including the dashboard and door, is visible, and the video clearly shows the door being closed, offering a detailed view of both the car's interior and its surroundings.",
    "Spatial": "The wide shot is fixed on a car door, with the front of the white vehicle positioned in the bottom left middle ground against a white, paneled garage door in the background.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
