  "merged_caption": "The video is a medium close-up shot focusing on a woman with long, straight, light-colored hair and a man with curly, light-colored, shoulder-length hair, wearing a dark suit jacket with a white corsage on the lapel and a dark bowtie. The couple is dancing and spinning in the center foreground, with the woman placing her left hand on the man's right shoulder and her right hand tightly clasped with the man's left hand, resting on his chest. They move in sync, swaying together as they look into each other's eyes and exchange soft words. The camera is positioned between hip and eye level, looking up at a low angle, employing a shallow depth of field to keep the foreground in focus. It arcs counterclockwise with slight unsteadiness and some shaking. Glittery star-shaped decorations are suspended in the middle ground above the people's heads and extend into the top background, accompanied by colorful, out-of-focus lights in red, green, and blue, creating a festive atmosphere. The background features indistinct vertical lines, possibly from striped wallpaper or curtains, and the overall lighting is soft and somewhat hazy. As the couple continues to dance, the lighting changes, casting different colors and shadows on their faces and bodies. In the middle of the video, the woman gently rests her head on the man's shoulder, adding a tender moment to their dance. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the shot, capturing the intimate interaction between the two as they embrace and spin together in the dimly lit party or dance setting.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
