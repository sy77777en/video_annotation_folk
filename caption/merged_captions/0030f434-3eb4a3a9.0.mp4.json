  "merged_caption": "This wide shot is captured from a stationary, driver's-eye-level perspective inside a vehicle, looking out at a street intersection on a bright, sunny day under a blue sky with scattered clouds. In the foreground, the car's dashboard and windshield frame the bottom of the scene. The middle ground is dominated by a continuous flow of cross-traffic moving from right to left across the center. The sequence begins with a white sedan with \"OPERATOR\" and a red and blue logo on its side in the center turning left and exiting the frame, while a yellow taxi on the right continues straight and exits the frame in that manner. They are followed by several SUVs, including a silver SUV and a dark SUV, and black sedans that also traverse the intersection from right to left. On the right corner, a brick building with a red and white striped awning houses a \"Deli & Grill,\" with pedestrians visible on the sidewalk in front of it. A woman in a black top and pink pants stands on the sidewalk near a crosswalk, waiting to cross, while a man on a scooter moves around in front of the shop. A red traffic light hangs in the top center, with a long line of vehicles waiting in two of the lanes. Across the street, residential buildings and green trees line the road, with power lines visible overhead. The camera captures the scene through a vehicle's windshield from a fixed, eye-level perspective looking straight ahead, with a slightly unsteady shot characteristic of a camera mounted in a stationary vehicle. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire street scene sharp and clear.",

    "Subject": "A variety of cars navigate a sunny street intersection. A white sedan with \"OPERATOR\" and a red and blue logo on its side turns left, while a yellow taxi cab travels straight across the intersection. Other vehicles, including a silver SUV, a dark SUV, and several black sedans, also pass through the intersection. On the corner, in front of a \"DELI & GRILL\" with a red and white striped awning located on the right side of the frame, a woman in a black top and pink pants stands on the sidewalk near a crosswalk. Other pedestrians are also visible on the sidewalk. The traffic light hanging over the intersection is red, with a long line of vehicles waiting in two of the lanes. On the opposite side of the street, across from the deli & grill, there is a two-story residential building.",
    "Motion": "From a stationary viewpoint at an intersection, a steady stream of vehicles, including a white sedan, a yellow taxi, and multiple SUVs, enters from the right. The vehicles either turn left, continue straight, or turn right into the opposite street. On the sidewalk at the far corner, a woman in pink pants and a dark top is standing, waiting to cross. On the same sidewalk, a man on a scooter is moving around in front of the shop marked \"DELI & GRILL.\"",
    "Scene": "A forward-facing dashcam view from a vehicle-mounted camera captures the scene ahead at a street intersection on a bright, sunny day under a blue sky with scattered clouds. A traffic light suspended over the asphalt road shows red. On the right corner, a brick building with a red and white striped awning houses a \"Deli & Grill.\" Across the street, residential buildings and green trees line the road, with power lines visible overhead. The intersection is active with a continuous flow of cross-traffic, including a white sedan, a yellow taxi, and several SUVs of different colors, while pedestrians are visible on the sidewalk.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
