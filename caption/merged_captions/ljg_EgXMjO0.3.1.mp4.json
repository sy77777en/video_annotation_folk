  "merged_caption": "Initially, a dark, angular house is positioned in the center-top of the frame, sitting on a hill that spans the bottom and center of the frame. The house is a simple silhouette with a steep roof and a single, small, illuminated square window on an upper level. A winding path, rendered with a dense texture of white, wavy lines, is depicted on the hill, leading up to the house. The sky is filled with large, dark, puffy clouds outlined in white, positioned in the top-left and top-right corners. The camera, which is unsteady with noticeable shaking, begins with a stationary shot of the house on the hill. It then moves forward, approaching the house. The scene rapidly flashes, resembling lightning strikes, causing the entire composition to deconstruct into fleeting abstract white lines and shapes against a black background. During these flashes, the most persistent element is the house's small, illuminated window, which maintains its center-top position. This cycle of illumination and disintegration repeats several times, offering fragmented glimpses of the image. Throughout this process, the illuminated window remains consistently visible, seemingly independent of the lightning strikes, except for a few frames towards the end. The original image of the house on the hill flickers back into view intermittently between these deconstructions. The scene transitions smoothly to just the lit window and a few abstract lines against a black background due to camera movement.",

    "Subject": "This black-and-white, scratchboard-style animation features a dark, angular house situated on a hill against a dark sky. The house is a simple silhouette with a steep roof and a single, small, illuminated square window. The hill is rendered with a dense texture of white, wavy lines, creating a sense of uneven ground, with a winding path leading up to the house. The sky is filled with lumpy, stylized clouds, also drawn with white lines. The scene flashes intermittently, resembling lightning strikes, causing the lines that form the house and landscape to vanish momentarily, with the lit window often being the most persistent element visible in the darkness.",
    "Motion": "A static, scratchboard-style drawing of a house on a hill is intermittently illuminated by multiple flashes of light against a night backdrop. Each flash briefly reveals the scene, which then deconstructs into fleeting, abstract white lines and shapes that dissolve into the darkness. This cycle of illumination and disintegration repeats several times, offering fragmented glimpses of the image. Throughout this process, a single illuminated window remains consistently visible, seemingly independent of the lightning strikes, except for a few frames towards the end.",
    "Scene": "In a black-and-white, chalk-style animation, a dark, angular house sits atop a hill under a cloudy night sky. A winding path, rendered with textured white lines, ascends the hill toward the structure. The house is presented in silhouette, with the exception of a single, small, illuminated square window on an upper level. The sky is filled with large, dark, puffy clouds outlined in white. The scene transitions smoothly to just the lit window and a few abstract lines against a black background due to camera movement.",
    "Spatial": "Initially, a dark house is positioned in the center-top of the frame, sitting on a hill that spans the bottom and center of the frame.

The scene then rapidly flashes, causing the entire composition to deconstruct into fleeting abstract white lines against a black background.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
