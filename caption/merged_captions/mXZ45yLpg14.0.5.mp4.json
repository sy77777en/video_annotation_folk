  "merged_caption": "This is a wide shot capturing a desolate, foggy landscape. A group of five silhouetted figures occupies the middle ground, positioned slightly left of the frame's center. They are moving slowly as a group towards the right side of the frame, dressed in similar protective clothing, making it difficult to determine their gender or age due to the foggy environment and distance. Some of the individuals appear to be carrying rifles. In the background, to their left, rests the silhouette of a vehicle on a slight incline, appearing abandoned and blending into the bleak surroundings. The foreground consists of dark, barren ground with sparse, charred vertical elements scattered across it, suggesting a recently burned or devastated area. On the far right, tall trees fade into the dense fog in the background, adding an element of mystery to the scene. The upper half of the frame is dominated by the uniform, foggy sky. The camera, positioned at eye level and utilizing deep focus with a large depth of field, pans slowly from left to right, maintaining smooth and steady movement. This movement emphasizes the interactions between the people and their surroundings as they move across the landscape. The atmosphere is gloomy and misty, creating a sense of isolation and urgency. One person stands slightly apart from the group on the left, while another individual with a slightly hunched posture is towards the right. The overall mood is somber, with the fog obscuring distant details and creating a sense of isolation. The time of day is indeterminate due to the thick fog that envelops the area, creating a muted, monochromatic atmosphere.",

    "Camera": "The video captures a foggy landscape with a camera at eye level and a level angle, utilizing deep focus and a large depth of field. The camera pans slowly from left to right, maintaining smooth and steady movement. The focus is on the entire scene, emphasizing the interactions between the people and their surroundings as they move across the landscape.",
    "Subject": "The video features a group of people walking across a misty, barren landscape. There are five individuals, all wearing similar protective clothing, making it difficult to determine their gender or age due to the foggy environment and distance. On the left, one person stands slightly apart from the group, while another individual with a slightly hunched posture is towards the right. Some of the individuals appear to be carrying rifles. The scene is characterized by a somber, foggy atmosphere, with the figures moving together across the terrain.",
    "Motion": "In a foggy, desolate landscape, a group of five people, dressed in similar protective clothing, walk together. The background is filled with sparse, tall, leafless plants, and an old, abandoned vehicle is visible on the left side. The group moves steadily from left to right, with some members slightly ahead or behind the others. The atmosphere is gloomy and misty, creating a sense of isolation and urgency.",
    "Scene": "The video depicts an outdoor scene set in a foggy, desolate landscape. The time of day is indeterminate due to the thick fog that envelops the area, creating a muted, monochromatic atmosphere. The ground is barren, with sparse, charred vegetation suggesting a recently burned or devastated area. Silhouettes of several figures are visible, moving across the terrain, adding a sense of motion and life to the otherwise still environment. A vehicle is partially visible on the left, appearing abandoned and blending into the bleak surroundings. Tall trees rise in the background on the right side, partially obscured by the fog, adding an element of mystery to the scene. The overall mood is somber, with the fog obscuring distant details and creating a sense of isolation.",
    "Spatial": "This is a wide shot capturing a desolate, foggy landscape. A group of five silhouetted figures occupies the middle ground, positioned slightly left of the frame's center. They are moving slowly as a group towards the right side of the frame. In the background, to their left, rests the silhouette of a vehicle on a slight incline. The foreground consists of dark, barren ground with sparse, charred vertical elements scattered across it. On the far right, tall trees fade into the dense fog in the background. The upper half of the frame is dominated by the uniform, foggy sky. The camera pans slowly from left to right, maintaining a smooth and steady movement at a relatively eye-level height compared to the figures in the middle ground."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
