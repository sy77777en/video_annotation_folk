  "merged_caption": "In a high-angle medium shot, a man is positioned in the right foreground, seen from behind as he walks down a staircase. He is wearing dark, possibly black, long-sleeved clothing. The dimly lit interior has a cool, greenish color cast, and the environment features dark, ornate metal railings with a repeating lattice pattern on both sides, framing his movement. The camera moves smoothly forward and tilts downward to follow his steady descent, maintaining deep focus. The light source appears to be from the lower level, faintly illuminating the steps and the landing below, while the upper area remains in deep shadow. As the man in dark clothing steadily descends the staircase, moving away from the camera, he walks down the steps at a consistent pace toward the dimly lit landing in the background.",

    "Camera": "From a high angle, this shot uses deep focus. The camera moves smoothly forward and tilts down to follow a person descending a staircase.",
    "Subject": "In a dimly lit setting, a man is seen from behind as he walks down a staircase. He is wearing dark, possibly black, long-sleeved clothing. Despite the low lighting, some details of his appearance are still visible.",
    "Motion": "Filmed from behind, a man in dark clothing steadily descends a dimly lit staircase, moving away from the camera. He walks down the steps at a consistent pace.",
    "Scene": "In a dimly lit interior, a person's silhouette is seen from behind as they descend a staircase. The environment is dark, with a cool, greenish color cast. The staircase features dark, ornate metal railings with a repeating lattice pattern. The light source appears to be from the lower level, faintly illuminating the steps and the landing below, while the upper area remains in deep shadow.",
    "Spatial": "In a high-angle medium shot, a man is positioned in the right foreground, seen from behind. He walks down a staircase, and the camera moves forward and tilts downward to follow his descent. The ornate railings on the left and right frame his movement toward the dimly lit landing in the background."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
