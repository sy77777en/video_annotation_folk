  "merged_caption": "The video showcases an extreme wide shot of a seascape featuring a large, fortress-like structure on a rocky outcrop. The fortress is centrally positioned in the middle ground, with its detailed architecture and earthy tones prominently displayed. The ocean surrounds the structure, filling the background and extending to the edges of the frame. In the top left corner, two boats are visible; one moves across the water, leaving a trail, while the other remains stationary. The camera maintains a consistent aerial perspective above the fortress and the surrounding sea. Initially, the island occupies the area from the top right corner to the center of the frame. As the camera moves, the island gradually shifts to occupy the upper central region, while the surrounding areas are covered by the sea. The camera, positioned at an aerial level with a high angle, looks down from above, employing deep focus with a large depth of field. It smoothly arcs clockwise at a slow speed, providing different angles and perspectives of the fortress and its surroundings. The ocean waves crash against the base of the structure, creating white foam. The video captures an expansive view of the ocean surrounding the fortress, emphasizing the interaction between the natural and built environments. The water's deep blue contrasts with the structure's earthy tones, highlighting the scale and atmosphere. The setting is outdoors, likely midday, as indicated by the bright lighting and clear visibility. The structure features beige stone walls and red-tiled roofs, with a distinct geometric shape following the island's contours. The ocean waves gently lap against the rocky base, creating a dynamic contrast between the solid architecture and the fluid water. On the island, there are some trees, vehicles, and a blue sports field, adding more detail to the scene.",

    "Camera": "The video features an aerial-level camera at a high angle, looking down from above. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera smoothly arcs clockwise at a slow speed.",
    "Subject": "The video is a seascape scenery shot. It captures an expansive view of the ocean surrounding a large, fortress-like structure perched on a rocky outcrop. The focus is on the vastness of the sea and the imposing architecture, emphasizing the interaction between the natural and built environments. The water's deep blue contrasts with the structure's earthy tones, highlighting the scale and atmosphere rather than a specific object. The scene conveys a sense of isolation and grandeur, with the ocean's expanse and the fortress's detailed design as key visual elements.",
    "Motion": "The video shows an aerial view of a large, fortified structure situated on a rocky outcrop surrounded by deep blue ocean waters. The structure appears to be a historical or military fortress, with multiple levels and walls, and several buildings with red-tiled roofs. The camera slowly rotates around the structure, providing different angles and perspectives of the fortress and its surroundings. The ocean waves crash against the base of the structure, creating white foam. In the background, one boat can be seen moving on the water, leaving a trail behind it, while another boat remains stationary.",
    "Scene": "The video, captured from a drone POV, showcases an aerial view of a large, fortress-like structure situated on a rocky island surrounded by deep blue ocean waters. The setting is outdoors, with the time of day likely being midday, as indicated by the bright lighting and clear visibility. The structure features a combination of beige stone walls and red-tiled roofs, with a distinct geometric shape that follows the contours of the island. The ocean waves gently lap against the rocky base, creating a dynamic contrast between the solid architecture and the fluid water. Two boats are visible in the ocean; one is moving while the other remains stationary. On the island, there are some trees, vehicles, and a blue sports field, adding more detail to the scene. The overall composition highlights the isolation and prominence of the fortress within the vast expanse of the sea, under calm weather conditions.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
