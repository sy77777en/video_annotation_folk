  "merged_caption": "In a full shot, a man with a medium build and light skin, wearing a dark jacket, dark pants, and a beanie, is positioned in the middle ground, walking from the left side of the frame toward the right. He carries a backpack and holds hiking poles, suggesting he is engaged in hiking or trekking. The camera, positioned at his level, tracks laterally with his movement, keeping him relatively centered. Initially, dark, silhouetted tree trunks occupy the immediate foreground on both the left and right sides. As the camera moves smoothly to the right across the silhouetted forest landscape, these trunks slide past the frame and eventually remain only on the left side, enhancing the sense of depth and dynamic motion in the scene. In the background, a distant mountain range with snow-capped peaks is visible in the upper center of the frame against a sky that glows with a warm, yellow-orange light near the horizon, indicating the scene is set at either dawn or dusk. The eye-level, level-angle shot with deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp, revealing the mountain landscape through the trees as the viewpoint moves laterally, causing the foreground trees to shift and blur slightly against the static mountain backdrop.",

    "Camera": "This is an eye-level, level-angle shot with a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp. The camera smoothly tracks rightward, revealing the mountain landscape through the trees.",
    "Subject": "The video features a man with a medium build and light skin, wearing a dark jacket, dark pants, and a beanie. He carries a backpack and is holding hiking poles, seen walking upright, facing in his forward direction. His posture and equipment suggest he is engaged in hiking or trekking.",
    "Motion": "A man carrying a backpack and holding hiking poles walks upright and faces forward, suggesting he is engaged in hiking or trekking, as the camera moves to the right across a silhouetted forest landscape at dusk, with mountains visible in the background.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set in a mountainous, wooded area at either dawn or dusk. Dark, silhouetted tree trunks with sparse, autumnal branches dominate the foreground. A distant mountain range with snow-capped peaks is visible against a sky that glows with a warm, yellow-orange light near the horizon. The viewpoint moves laterally, causing the foreground trees to shift and blur slightly against the static mountain backdrop.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
