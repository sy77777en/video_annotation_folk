  "merged_caption": "This shot combines a close-up and a wide view, with the camera positioned at ground level and at a level angle, mounted in front of the car's front wheel. The car's red side panel occupies the left foreground, while its rapidly spinning front wheel is in the center-left foreground. The right side of the frame opens to the scenery, with the paved road extending from the bottom right foreground into the background. A silhouetted treeline stretches across the right middle ground, set against the sun, which is positioned at the horizon in the center-right. The sky fills the upper right of the frame, reaching into the background. Because the camera is fixed to the car, the vehicle remains stationary within the frame as the road and trees rush past from the middle ground, creating motion-blurred streaks that convey a sense of high-speed forward movement. The front wheel spins rapidly, and the rapid blur makes the textures on the ground appear like illuminated streaks that fly past. From a smooth, ground-level, and level-angle perspective, the camera moves quickly backward and to the right, leading a red car from the front. A deep focus keeps the car's wheel, the road, and the distant scenery sharp. The most prominent feature is the front wheel, which is black with sunlight reflecting on the outer rim, giving it a golden appearance. The black tire is mounted on this wheel. Adjacent to the wheel, a portion of the car's glossy red body panel is visible, along with a red side mirror further in the distance. A line of dark trees is silhouetted against the bright, low sun, which casts a golden glow across the scene. The sky is clear, fading from orange at the horizon to blue above, where several celestial bodies are visible.",

    "Subject": "This locked-on POV shot features a camera mounted on the front side of a red car.

Adjacent to the wheel, a portion of the car's glossy red body panel is visible, along with a red side mirror further in the distance.",
    "Motion": "From a level-angle perspective fixed to the side of a red car, the vehicle drives forward along a paved road at sunset or sunrise. The front wheel spins rapidly, and the rapid blur makes the textures on the ground appear like illuminated streaks that fly past.",
    "Scene": "A locked-on POV shot from a level angle on the side of a red car captures the front wheel spinning as the vehicle travels down a paved road at sunset or sunrise. A line of dark trees is silhouetted against the bright, low sun, which casts a golden glow across the scene. The sky is clear, fading from orange at the horizon to blue above, where several celestial bodies are visible. The black tire on a dark rim moves swiftly, and the texture of the road surface appears as illuminated streaks in the sunlight due to the fast movement.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
