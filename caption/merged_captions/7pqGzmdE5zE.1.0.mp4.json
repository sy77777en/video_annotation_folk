  "merged_caption": "This wide shot captures a multi-story, white-walled apartment building that fills the center of the frame, with a black metal fire escape running vertically down the middle of the building's facade. The camera is positioned at a slightly low angle, level with the lower portion of the building, and maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire building clear. The scene is set at night, with the sound of crickets chirping. The camera slowly zooms in, revealing more details of the structure and emphasizing the quiet, nocturnal atmosphere. Several windows, both rectangular and arched, are illuminated from within, casting a warm light, including one in the top center and a few in the top right. A streetlamp in the foreground on the right casts a brighter, cooler light across the scene, creating distinct shadows and highlighting the building's textures. On the far left, a large, dark, stylized logo is painted on an adjacent wall. In the background on the right, the silhouettes of tall palm trees are visible against the dark sky, reinforcing the urban setting. Dark bushes occupy the foreground in the bottom left corner. The facade is characterized by a mix of rectangular and arched windows, with landings on each floor and a small balcony on the top level. The camera's very slow and smooth zoom-in adds movement and emphasizes the structure, while the street light illuminates the front of the building.",

    "Subject": "This video presents an architectural scenery shot of a multi-story, white-walled building against a dark night sky. The camera zooms in on the building, adding movement and emphasizing the structure and the quiet, nocturnal atmosphere. The facade is characterized by a mix of rectangular and arched windows, with a prominent black metal fire escape running down the center. A few windows are illuminated with a warm, interior light, while a streetlamp casts a brighter, cooler light across the building, creating distinct shadows and highlighting its textures. In the background, the silhouettes of tall palm trees are visible, reinforcing the urban setting.",
    "Motion": "This is a wide shot of a multi-story apartment building at night. A street light illuminates the front of the white building, and several windows are lit from within. The camera gradually zooms in during the clip.",
    "Scene": "At night, a shot begins with the facade of a light-colored, multi-story apartment building against a dark sky, with the sound of crickets chirping. The camera gradually zooms in, revealing a black metal fire escape running down the center of the building, with landings on each floor and a small balcony on the top level. Several windows, both rectangular and arched, are illuminated from within, casting a warm light. A streetlamp on the right side of the scene also casts light onto the building. On the far left, a large, dark, stylized logo is painted on the wall. The silhouettes of tall palm trees are visible on the right.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
