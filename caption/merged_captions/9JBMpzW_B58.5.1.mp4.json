  "merged_caption": "This video presents a maritime scenery shot from a fixed, level-angle perspective on the bow of a massive container ship, captured in a time-lapse. The extreme wide shot is symmetrically framed, with the bottom half occupied by rows of red, blue, white, and green shipping containers in the foreground and middle ground, leading the eye toward the center. The ocean fills the middle ground, extending to the horizon line that bisects the frame horizontally. The sky occupies the entire top half of the frame in the background. The camera is mounted above the containers and sea surface, ideally between overhead and aerial levels, maintaining a level angle for a smooth and steady shot. A deep focus keeps the entire expanse of the ship, sea, and sky sharp. The time-lapse effect captures the vessel's forward motion across the ocean as the sky changes rapidly. The sequence begins with the soft, colorful light of dusk, transitioning into a more uniform, overcast daytime sky. The primary motion is the rapid movement of clouds across the vast expanse. The video transitions from a serene dawn or dusk, where the horizon glows with soft pink and purple light under a layered, cloudy sky, to an overcast daytime scene with a uniformly grey sky and dark ocean stretching to the horizon. The focus is on the immense scale of the natural environment and atmospheric changes over time, with the ship serving as a static vantage point, emphasizing the vastness of the sea and dynamic sky. An overlay watermark in the bottom right of center displays the text \"JEFFREY.HK\" and \"JEFFHK\".",

    "Camera": "This time-lapse video is captured from a camera mounted on a cargo ship, positioned above the containers and the sea surface, ideally between overhead and aerial levels. The camera maintains a level angle, providing a smooth and steady shot. A deep focus keeps the entire expanse of the ship, sea, and sky sharp. While the camera is fixed relative to the ship, the time-lapse effect captures the vessel's forward motion across the ocean as the sky changes rapidly.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a maritime scenery shot, captured in a time-lapse from the bow of a massive container ship. The perspective looks forward over stacks of red, blue, white, and green shipping containers that create a geometric foreground and middle ground, leading the eye out to a vast, smooth-surfaced ocean stretching to the horizon. The sky undergoes a dramatic transformation, shifting from the soft, pastel pinks and purples of a dusky sunset to a turbulent, overcast grey with fast-moving clouds. The focus of the video is not on a particular subject but rather on the immense scale of the natural environment and the atmospheric changes over time. The ship serves as a static vantage point, emphasizing the vastness of the sea and the dynamic sky.",
    "Motion": "This scenic video presents a time-lapse view from the bow of a large container ship sailing on the open ocean. The sequence captures the dramatic shift in the sky, starting with the soft, colorful light of dusk that transitions into a more uniform, overcast daytime sky. The primary motion is the rapid movement of clouds across the vast expanse, characteristic of a time-lapse.",
    "Scene": "From a high, objective viewpoint aboard a massive container ship, the scene looks forward over rows of stacked shipping containers toward the open sea. The containers, in shades of red, blue, green, and white, fill the lower portion of the view as the vessel steadily moves forward. The video transitions from a serene dawn or dusk, where the horizon glows with soft pink and purple light under a layered, cloudy sky, to an overcast daytime scene. In the latter part, the sky is uniformly grey with clouds, and the dark ocean stretches to the horizon. An overlay watermark in the bottom right of center displays the text \"JEFFREY.HK\" and \"JEFFHK\".",
    "Spatial": "This video presents a maritime scenery shot from a fixed, level-angle perspective. The extreme wide shot is symmetrically framed, with the bottom half occupied by rows of shipping containers in the foreground and middle ground, which lead the eye toward the center. The ocean fills the middle ground, extending to the horizon line that bisects the frame horizontally. The sky occupies the entire top half of the frame in the background. While the video is a time-lapse showing the movement of clouds and changing light, the spatial composition and the camera's viewpoint remain static throughout. A watermark is visible in the bottom right of center."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
