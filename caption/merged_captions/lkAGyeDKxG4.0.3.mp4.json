  "merged_caption": "In a close-up shot, a light-skinned man with brown hair, a mustache and stubble, and blue eyes is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the foreground. He wears a black high-collared jacket and a backpack with visible orange straps and a white reflective strip. The background is an out-of-focus, cool-toned wash of blue and grey, suggesting an outdoor setting under overcast or foggy conditions. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, maintaining a tight, centered framing on his face with an extremely shallow depth of field, keeping the focus fixed on him. The camera slightly pans to the right and exhibits a minor shake. Throughout the clip, the man breathes heavily with his mouth open, his expression strained as he looks around. His head moves slightly, turning from side to side and looking down. He raises his right hand to the back of his head, removes his hat by pulling it backward, and then lowers his arm. He briefly closes his eyes before opening them again and places his right hand on his forehead.",

    "Subject": "A light-skinned man with brown hair, a mustache and stubble, and blue eyes is shown in a close-up. He wears a black high-collared jacket and a backpack with visible orange straps and a white reflective strip. Throughout the video, he appears to be breathing heavily with his mouth open, and his expression is strained as he looks around and briefly closes his eyes. He also raises a hand to the side of his head.",

    "Scene": "In an outdoor setting under overcast or foggy conditions, a man with brown hair and light facial hair is seen in a close-up. He is wearing a black jacket that has orange straps and reflective strips over the shoulders. The background is an out-of-focus, cool-toned wash of blue and grey.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
