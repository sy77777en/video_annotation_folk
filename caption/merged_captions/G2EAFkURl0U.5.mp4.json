  "merged_caption": "The video is a wide shot of a wooded campground, capturing the overall environment and atmosphere. The camera is at eye level, looking straight ahead, and maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping all elements sharp. The video begins with a view of a log cabin in the middle ground on the left, featuring a small porch with wooden railings and a green door. In the foreground, an asphalt surface is visible. In the middle ground, a gravel area with a picnic table and a circular black metal fire pit on a stand is bordered by wooden beams. The ground throughout the campground is a mix of grass, gravel, and fallen leaves. As the camera smoothly pans slowly from left to right, it reveals more of the campground, including another log cabin with a similar design and green roof, and additional log cabins in both the middle ground and background among trees with predominantly green foliage, interspersed with some autumn colors. The cabins are positioned throughout the scene, while the trees are scattered, providing depth. Adjacent to the first cabin, on a gravel area strewn with brown and yellow fallen leaves, are a wooden picnic table with attached benches and a fire pit in the middle of the yard. The camera continues to move right, revealing more of the second cabin and the surrounding trees, with a paved path and additional picnic tables in the background. The camera maintains a consistent height, level with the cabins, emphasizing the breadth of the setting without focusing on any single element. The slight pan across the scene further emphasizes the breadth of the setting, showcasing multiple log cabins, picnic tables, and a fire pit nestled among the trees.",

    "Subject": "This is an outdoor scenery shot of a campground. There is no main subject because the focus is on the overall environment and atmosphere of the wooded campground, showcasing multiple log cabins, picnic tables, and a fire pit nestled among the trees, rather than highlighting a single specific object or person. The slight pan across the scene further emphasizes the breadth of the setting.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a view of a log cabin with a green door and a picnic table in front of it, situated in a wooded area with fallen leaves on the ground. As the camera pans to the right, another log cabin with a similar design and green roof comes into view, along with a fire pit in the middle of the yard. The camera continues to move right, revealing more of the second cabin and the surrounding trees, with a paved path and additional picnic tables in the background.",
    "Scene": "The scene is an outdoor campground during the day, set within a wooded area. The camera pans slowly from left to right, revealing several log cabins. The closest cabin, constructed from dark brown logs with a green shingled gambrel roof, features a small porch with wooden railings and a dark green door. Adjacent to this cabin, on a gravel area strewn with brown and yellow fallen leaves, are a wooden picnic table with attached benches and a circular black metal fire pit on a stand. Low wooden beams border this gravel patch, which is next to a paved asphalt surface in the immediate foreground. In the background, more log cabins of similar design are nestled among numerous trees with predominantly green foliage, interspersed with some autumn colors. The ground throughout the campground is a mix of grass, gravel, and fallen leaves.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
