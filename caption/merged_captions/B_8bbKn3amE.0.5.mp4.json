  "merged_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide scenery shot captured from a high-angle, fast-moving aerial perspective. Initially, the frame is filled with the dense, red-tiled roofs of a hillside city, which extend from the foreground at the bottom to the background at the top, with mountains visible in the distant background under a clear blue sky with a few light clouds. The camera begins at a high angle, looking down on the rooftops, and maintains a varying Dutch angle as it rolls. It performs a complex motion, first moving forward over the buildings, then arcing clockwise to reveal a white church with a brick bell tower perched on a hill, positioned slightly left of center, with a set of stairs extending from the bottom foreground towards the center middle ground of the frame. The camera swoops rapidly forward and down, causing the rooftops to rush past in the immediate foreground. As the camera banks and turns, the frame tilts dramatically, navigating through the city's architecture characterized by its ubiquitous red-orange terracotta-tiled roofs and white-walled buildings, some featuring blue or green window frames. The exhilarating flight path navigates through narrow gaps and over rooftops, eventually revealing the historic-looking church on an elevated piece of land with stone retaining walls. The shot concludes by moving forward again, transitioning to a more level perspective, showcasing the overall scale, atmosphere, and unique architectural texture of the city itself, rather than isolating a specific focal point. The entire town remains sharp due to the deep focus of the smooth, aerial drone shot, emphasizing the dynamic and immersive experience of the fast-paced aerial journey over the colonial-style buildings of the city built on a mountainside.",

    "Subject": "This video presents a dynamic aerial cityscape scenery shot, captured from the perspective of a fast-moving drone. The camera swoops and glides over a dense, sprawling city built on a mountainside, characterized by its ubiquitous red-orange terracotta-tiled roofs and white-walled buildings. The exhilarating flight path navigates through narrow gaps and over rooftops, eventually revealing a historic-looking white church with a brick bell tower perched on a higher elevation. There is no single main subject, as the rapid, immersive camera movement is designed to showcase the overall scale, atmosphere, and unique architectural texture of the city itself, rather than isolating a specific focal point.",
    "Motion": "This fast-paced aerial video shows a dynamic flight over the red-tiled rooftops of a city built on a mountainside. The camera swoops low over the historic, colonial-style buildings. The flight path eventually reveals a white church with a bell tower perched on the hill.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone flies low and fast over the dense, reddish-brown terracotta tile roofs of a city built on a hillside. The buildings have white and off-white walls, with some featuring blue or green window frames. In the background, large, arid mountains rise under a clear blue sky with a few light clouds. The drone's path moves towards a white church with a brick bell tower, which sits on an elevated piece of land with stone retaining walls and a set of stairs leading up to it.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
