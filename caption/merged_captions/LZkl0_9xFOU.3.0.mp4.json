  "merged_caption": "The video presents a full shot, with the camera positioned at the subject's level in an Over-the-Shoulder shot, moving smoothly forward. A rectangular computer screen, angled slightly to the left, occupies the center of the frame in the middle ground. Initially, the screen displays a menu with \"Test Connection to XePartnerNet\" highlighted in light green on a dark blue-grey background, alongside options like \"Clear Xbox Live configuration\" and \"Create a new profile.\" The screen then transitions to show \"Testing Network Connection\" and \"Logging on to Xbox Live: 0 seconds.\" Finally, it changes to display a list of arcade games, including \"Banjo-Kazooie,\" \"Banjo-Tooie,\" \"Burgertime World Tour,\" \"Burnout™ CRASH!,\" and \"Crimson Alliance,\" each labeled \"Arcade Game\" with a \"0/200\" score, on a light green background with several square icons to the right. A blurry portion of a person's light-toned hair is visible in the foreground on the right side of the frame. In the middle ground, to the bottom right of the screen, a stack of colorful magazines is present. The background consists of light purple, vertically striped wallpaper. A white text overlay, \"[9,15]: Modern Vintage Gaming - The Story of Xbox 360 PartnerNet Game Leaks | MVO (2020),\" is positioned in the bottom left corner throughout the video. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, with the focus on the screen in the midground, effectively illustrating the perspective and angle of the scene.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
