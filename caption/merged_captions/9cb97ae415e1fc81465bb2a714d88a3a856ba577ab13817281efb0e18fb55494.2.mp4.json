  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of a serene park setting, focusing on the road beside a green path. The road is positioned in the middle ground, running horizontally across the frame, with vehicles visible in both the middle ground and background. The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, looking straight ahead. It uses deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping all elements sharp. As the camera smoothly pans to the right, with slight unsteadiness and some shaking, the emphasis shifts to the expansive green lawn, which occupies the foreground and middle ground. The lawn is dotted with a few bare trees, positioned in the top left and right of the frame, suggesting a late autumn or early spring setting. The golden sunlight casts long shadows from the trees and other elements, adding depth and warmth to the scene. Shadows of the cameraman and trees are visible on the grass, indicating it is either early morning or late afternoon. In the background, additional trees and buildings are visible, with passing vehicles maintaining the focus on the natural elements. The buildings are residential, with brick facades and pitched roofs, and the sky is mostly clear with a few scattered clouds. This contributes to the warm, golden light that enhances the scene's tranquil atmosphere. In the middle ground, a road with light traffic is visible, featuring a few cars and a pedestrian crossing. The overall environment is calm, with a mix of natural and urban elements harmoniously coexisting, highlighting the tranquil environment.",

    "Subject": "The video captures a serene park setting, beginning with a focus on the road beside the green path. As the camera smoothly pans to the right, the emphasis transitions to the expansive green lawn, dotted with a few bare trees, effectively suggesting a late autumn or early spring atmosphere. The golden sunlight casts long shadows, adding depth and warmth to the scene.

    "Motion": "The video captures a peaceful urban park scene with trees, grass, and a road with passing vehicles. The lighting suggests it is either early morning or late afternoon. Shadows of the cameraman and trees are visible on the grass.",
    "Scene": "The scene depicts an outdoor urban park setting during the late afternoon, with sunlight casting long shadows across the grassy area. The grass is lush and green, interspersed with a few bare trees, indicating a season of early spring or late autumn. In the middle ground, a road with light traffic is visible, featuring a few cars and a pedestrian crossing. In the background, the buildings are residential, with brick facades and pitched roofs, and the sky is mostly clear with a few scattered clouds.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
