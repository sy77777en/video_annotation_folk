  "merged_caption": "In a close-up shot, a Black man with a goatee is positioned in the center foreground, looking directly at the camera, which is at his level. He wears a brown fedora with a black band, dark sunglasses, and a rust-colored collared shirt. On his left hand, he wears a large, futuristic-looking finger brace, primarily silver and white with a rectangular face and a wide band that has blue stripes, visible in the bottom right of the frame. The scene takes place on a sunlit, tree-lined city street during the daytime. In the background, multi-story brownstone buildings with visible windows line the asphalt road on both the left and right. Lush green foliage and bushes are present along the sidewalk, partially enclosed by a low, black metal fence on the left, while a prominent tree trunk stands on the right side of the view. A single car is visible in the distance down the street. The man in the brown fedora moves forward smoothly, his mouth appearing to chew something. The camera, in a smooth, eye-level shot with a level angle and a shallow depth of field, keeps the man in the foreground in focus as it moves backward, leading him as he walks toward it. The city street extends from the right towards the center, creating a dynamic composition that emphasizes the man's forward motion against the static background elements.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
