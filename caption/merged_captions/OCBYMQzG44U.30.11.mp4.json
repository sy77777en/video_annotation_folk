  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot from a first-person perspective, filmed from a slightly unsteady angle with mild barrel distortion. Initially, the camera is at a low angle, looking up a short flight of white-tiled steps that occupy the bottom of the frame. These steps lead to a rectangular doorway positioned in the right-center of the middle ground, which frames a view into a darker room where a single circular light is visible in the background. The video begins in a minimalist architectural space, with the camera moving forward from a shallow, square pool featuring a black and white design. It ascends the short flight of stairs and proceeds through a narrow, white-tiled corridor, ultimately revealing a larger room. As the camera moves forward and upward, passing through the doorway, the angle shifts to a level view, maintaining a deep focus throughout the shot to keep the entire scene sharp. Upon entering the next space, the perspective reveals a large, sparsely lit room. A recessed, square-shaped area with a black-tiled border and a white-tiled interior now dominates the floor in the middle ground, while the surrounding walls and multiple ceiling lights fill the rest of the frame. The lower portion of the walls is a dark, solid color, contrasting with the white-tiled upper walls. Several circular lights in the ceiling illuminate the sterile, geometric interior with a cool, greenish-white light. The focus is on the environment, emphasizing the architectural design and atmosphere rather than a specific object. The shots highlight the scale and spatial arrangement, creating a sense of place. This type of shot could serve as an establishing shot, setting the scene and providing context for the viewer.",

    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves forward from a narrow entryway with short steps, all covered in small white tiles. The camera passes through a rectangular doorway into a larger, sparsely lit room. This space features the same white-tiled floor, but with a large, recessed rectangular area in the center defined by a black-tiled border and a white interior. The lower portion of the walls is a dark, solid color, contrasting with the white-tiled upper walls. Several circular lights in the ceiling illuminate the sterile, geometric interior with a cool, greenish-white light.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
