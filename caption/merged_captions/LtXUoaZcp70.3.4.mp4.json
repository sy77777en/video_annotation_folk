  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium-full shot of a man rendered entirely in a grainy, bright red texture, standing in the middle ground, slightly left of center on a tiled floor against a solid black background. He is wearing a long, military-style coat with a high collar and a peaked cap, with his hands on his hips. A large, out-of-focus figure with a grainy blue and purple texture occupies the foreground on the right side of the frame. From a smooth, hip-level perspective, the camera moves backward, starting with a shallow depth of field that focuses on the red figure. As the camera performs a rack focus, the plane of focus shifts to the blue figure in the foreground. This transition brings the waist and hip area of the blue figure into sharp focus, revealing a small, glowing red sphere, resembling a hand grenade, tucked into its side. Consequently, the red figure in the middle ground becomes blurred. Both figures remain motionless throughout the shot. The only text visible in the video is \"[36,37,38],\" located at the bottom left of the frame.",

    "Camera": "From a smooth, hip-level perspective, the camera moves backward. The shot begins with a shallow depth of field, focusing on a red figure in the midground. It then performs a rack focus, shifting the plane of focus to a blue figure in the foreground.",
    "Subject": "A man, rendered entirely in a grainy, bright red texture, stands in the middle ground. He is wearing a long, military-style coat with a high collar and a peaked cap, and his hands are on his hips. In the foreground, the waist and hip area of a second figure is visible, rendered in a similar grainy texture but in a deep blue hue. As the focus shifts from the red man to the blue figure, a small, glowing red sphere, resembling a hand grenade, becomes visible tucked into the blue figure's side.",
    "Motion": "The camera's focus transitions from a stationary red figure in the middle ground to a blue figure in the foreground. As the blue figure comes into focus, a small, glowing red object tucked into its side is revealed. Both figures remain motionless throughout the shot.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set in a dark, undefined space with a tiled floor against a solid black background. A figure in a military-style uniform, rendered entirely in a grainy red texture, stands in the distance. In the foreground, a large, translucent figure with a grainy blue and purple texture is positioned. The focus shifts from the red figure to the one in the foreground, revealing a glowing red, spherical object visible inside the blue figure's hip. The only text visible in the video is \"[36,37,38],\" located at the bottom left of the frame.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium-full shot of a red figure standing in the middle ground, positioned slightly left of center on a tiled floor against a black background. A large, out-of-focus blue figure occupies the foreground on the right side of the frame. The camera then moves backward as the focus racks from the red figure to the blue one. This transition brings the waist and hip area of the blue figure into sharp focus in the foreground on the right, revealing a small, glowing red sphere tucked into its side. Consequently, the red figure in the middle ground becomes blurred. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
