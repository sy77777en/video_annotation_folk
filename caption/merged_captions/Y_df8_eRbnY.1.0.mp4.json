  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a climber positioned in the center of the frame and primarily in the foreground, scaling a large, gray rock face inside a dark cave. The climber, a person with dark brown hair held in place by the strap of a headlamp, is wearing a dark brown long-sleeved shirt and dark pants. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, follows the climber's upward reach, resulting in a medium shot that shows the climber from the hip up. The scene is illuminated by the climber's headlamp, casting deep shadows and highlighting the rough, granular texture of the rock face. The camera begins at a high angle, panning right to center the climber. As the climber ascends, the camera tilts upward to track their movement, causing the angle to become more level. The climber uses both hands to grip crevices in the rock, repositioning their right leg onto the crevice where their right hand was initially holding, boosting themselves upward as they reach with their right hand to a higher crevice. Twisting their torso, they bring their left hand up to a new hold. Around the three-second mark, another man's head with red hair briefly appears in the bottom right middle ground, leaning in to look towards the climber. Shortly after, a left arm in a pink-sleeved jacket becomes visible in the same bottom right foreground position, gesturing toward the central climber, who is now in the middle ground. Both the head and the arm leave the frame within a second of appearing. The shot ends as a medium shot with the main climber in the center foreground. The camera remains very unsteady throughout the entire video, similar to the stability of a handheld shot.",

    "Camera": "This is an eye-level shot with a deep focus and large depth of field. The camera begins at a high angle, panning right to center the climber. As the climber ascends, the camera tilts upward to track their movement, causing the angle to become more level. The camera remains very unsteady throughout the entire video, similar to the stability of a handheld shot.",
    "Subject": "A person with dark brown hair falling to the shoulder, held in place by the strap of a headlamp, is shown rock climbing in a dark, confined space. They are wearing a dark brown long-sleeved shirt, dark pants, and a headlamp that illuminates the rough, grey rock face directly in front of them. Seen from a low angle, the climber uses both hands to grip crevices in the rock, contorting their body as they navigate the climbing route. The headlamp creates a bright, focused circle of light, leaving the rest of the scene and the climber's features in deep shadow. Around the three-second mark, another man's head with red hair briefly appears in the bottom right corner of the frame, looking towards the climber. Additionally, around the four-second mark, a left arm in a pink-sleeved jacket is momentarily visible in the bottom right corner, gesturing towards the climber.",
    "Motion": "A climber, illuminated by a headlamp in a dark space, holds onto a rock face with both hands. They reposition their right leg onto the crevice where their right hand was initially holding, boosting themselves upward as they reach with their right hand to a higher crevice. Twisting their torso, they bring their left hand up to a new hold. The video concludes at this point. The camera starts at a high angle, transitioning to a level angle as the climber ascends. At the three-second mark, a man's head briefly appears in the frame, leaning in to look towards the climber, followed by an arm with a pink sleeve gesturing towards the climber around the four-second mark. Both the head and the arm leave the frame within a second of appearing.",
    "Scene": "Inside a dark cave, a person is bouldering on a large, gray rock formation. The scene is illuminated by the climber's headlamp, which casts deep shadows and highlights the rough, granular texture of the rock face. The climber, wearing dark clothing, moves across the rock, their hands gripping crevices as the focused beam of light follows their path through the otherwise pitch-black surroundings.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
