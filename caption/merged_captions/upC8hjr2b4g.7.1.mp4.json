  "merged_caption": "A medium shot, captured from a high angle, shows a dense crowd of stationary, computer-generated human figures rendered in a uniform white color with a low-polygon, faceted appearance, giving them a geometric and abstract quality. The crowd fills the entire frame, positioned on a light-colored, flat ground under a bright light source that casts long, dark shadows behind them. The background is a hazy, grey expanse, providing no specific context to the location. The figures lack detailed facial features, skin texture, or specific clothing patterns, creating a sense of anonymity, though they are depicted wearing simple, modern clothing, such as a hoodie on a central male-presenting figure. The crowd is composed of figures with varied, though simplified, hairstyles and body shapes, suggesting a mix of genders. The figures are posed as if walking but remain stationary. The camera primarily trucks left with a subtle right pan and an upward tilt over the crowd, gliding slowly through the static group. A shallow depth of field creates distinct layers, keeping the figures in the midground in focus. In the middle ground, a male-presenting figure in a hoodie stands slightly right of center in focus, surrounded by other figures. As the camera moves, certain figures come into sharp view while others become blurred in the foreground and background due to the camera's shifting position. The foreground, at the bottom of the frame, and the background, at the top, are occupied by numerous figures that are heavily blurred as the focus shifts between the figures.",

    "Camera": "From a high angle, the camera primarily trucks left with a subtle right pan and an upward tilt over a crowd of white, low-poly figures. A shallow depth of field keeps the figures in the midground in focus.",
    "Subject": "The video features a dense crowd of stylized, computer-generated human figures. All the figures are rendered in a uniform white color and have a low-polygon, faceted appearance, giving them a geometric and abstract quality. They lack detailed facial features, skin texture, or specific clothing patterns, creating a sense of anonymity. Despite the abstraction, the figures are depicted wearing simple, modern clothing, such as a hoodie on a central male-presenting figure. The crowd is composed of figures with varied, though simplified, hairstyles and body shapes, suggesting a mix of genders. The figures are posed as if walking, but remain stationary, with the camera's shallow depth of field bringing different individuals into and out of focus.",
    "Motion": "The crowd of stylized, computer-generated figures remains completely stationary throughout the video. The only movement is from the camera, which glides slowly through the static group. As the camera moves, certain figures come into sharp view while others become blurred in the foreground and background, due to the camera's shifting position.",
    "Scene": "A crowd of low-polygon, white, human-like figures stands stationary in an indistinct space. The figures are uniform in their stark white color and faceted, geometric shapes, lacking any detailed features. They are positioned on a light-colored, flat ground under a bright light source that casts long, dark shadows behind them. The background is a hazy, grey expanse, providing no specific context to the location.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
