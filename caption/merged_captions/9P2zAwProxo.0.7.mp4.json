  "merged_caption": "In a medium full shot captured from a low angle, a man with light skin and a beard is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the foreground. He is dressed in winter sports attire, including a black helmet, black ski goggles, a black jacket with white sleeves, black pants, and black gloves, with a pink and white pass clipped to his jacket. The camera, mounted on a selfie stick and focused on the man's face, starts at hip level, briefly drops to ground level, and then rises back. The man maintains a low, athletic crouch as he glides forward through a snowy forest, navigating between tall, bare trees with numerous thin branches. The ground is completely covered in white snow, and the bright, overcast sky is visible above. The camera, looking up at him, moves backward through the snowy landscape, rolling first clockwise, then counterclockwise, while maintaining deep focus to keep everything sharp. As the camera retreats, the man remains in his central foreground position, turning his head and upper body as he moves, while the trees in the middleground and background appear to move past, enhancing the sense of motion through the forest. Near the end, the camera pans right as the man takes a turn, maintaining the dynamic and slightly unsteady, handheld shot from a low, Dutch-angled perspective.",

    "Camera": "This slightly unsteady, handheld shot is captured from a low, Dutch-angled perspective that varies due to camera rolling. The camera, mounted on a selfie stick and focused on the person's face, starts at hip level, briefly drops to ground level, and then rises back. Leading the subject from the front, the camera moves backward while rolling first clockwise, then counterclockwise. Near the end, it pans right as the person takes a turn. The shot uses a deep focus, keeping everything sharp.",
    "Subject": "A man with light skin and a beard is shown from a low-angle perspective in a snowy, wooded area. He is dressed in winter sports attire, consisting of a black helmet, black ski goggles, a black jacket with white sleeves, and black pants. He wears black gloves and has a pink and white pass with black lettering clipped to his jacket. The man is in a low, athletic stance, holding a ski pole with a red strap in one hand.",
    "Motion": "From a low-angle perspective, a man glides forward through a snowy forest. He maintains a low, athletic crouch as he navigates between the bare trees, turning his head and upper body as he moves.",
    "Scene": "A selfie POV shot captures a person in ski gear moving through a snowy forest during the daytime. The camera, held at a low angle, looks up at the person and the surrounding environment. The ground is completely covered in white snow. Tall, bare trees with numerous thin branches rise on all sides, their tops reaching towards the bright, overcast sky. The person, wearing a helmet, goggles, and winter clothing, holds a ski pole while navigating the wooded, snow-covered terrain.",
    "Spatial": "In a medium full shot captured from a low angle, a man is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the foreground. The camera, looking up at him, moves backward through a snowy landscape. Surrounding the man, bare trees are visible in both the middleground and the background, their trunks extending from the bottom of the frame towards the top, creating a sense of enclosure. As the camera retreats, the man maintains his central foreground position, while the trees in the middleground and background appear to move past, enhancing the sense of motion through the forest."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
