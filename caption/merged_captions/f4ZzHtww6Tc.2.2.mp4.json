  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a skateboarder skillfully navigating a sidewalk, captured in a dynamic full shot. The man, wearing a white cap, brown short-sleeve shirt, blue jeans, and white sneakers, is skateboarding next to a brick building with a laundromat sign. The camera, at ground level with noticeable fisheye distortion, follows the skateboarder with an unsteady side-tracking shot, maintaining a consistent distance to emphasize his fluid movements and agility. As he approaches a ramp, he bends down, prepares to jump, and successfully jumps over the ramp handrails, maintaining his balance on the skateboard. The camera moves up and down as the skateboarder jumps, capturing his impressive control. After clearing the ramp, he lands smoothly and continues skateboarding forward. The perspective shifts to a rear view, highlighting the skateboarder's acceleration and speed as he glides through the environment. The camera pans slightly left at the end as the skateboarder moves away, with noticeable shaking throughout. The urban backdrop, featuring static elements like a red brick wall, parked vehicles, and a laundromat sign, contrasts with the skateboarder's dynamic motion. The environment includes a sidewalk adjacent to a red brick building with visible vents and a black door, transitioning to a parking lot area with parked vans and cars. The sky is clear, indicating fair weather, and the bright daylight casts defined shadows on the ground. Overlay elements serve as a framing component, enhancing the visual context without being intrusive. Throughout the video, the camera remains at eye level, focusing on the skateboarder's graceful navigation of the urban landscape, capturing the seamless flow of his movements against a clear sky.",

    "Camera": "The video features noticeable fisheye distortion, causing straight lines to curve outward. The camera is at ground level with a level angle, using deep focus with a large depth of field. It captures an unsteady side-tracking shot, following a skateboarder moving left. The camera moves up and down as the skateboarder jumps mid-video and pans slightly left at the end as the skateboarder moves away, with noticeable shaking throughout.",
    "Subject": "The video begins by capturing a man skateboarding from the side before transitioning to a view from behind as he accelerates beyond the camera's pace. He is wearing a white cap, a brown short-sleeve shirt, blue jeans, and white sneakers. The man showcases his dynamic posture and skillful control as he balances on the skateboard. A highlight of his skateboarding activity is when he jumps over the ramp handrails, demonstrating impressive agility. The setting includes urban elements like a brick wall and parked vehicles, but the focus remains on the man's impressive skateboarding maneuvers.",

    "Scene": "The video captures an outdoor suburban setting during the day, featuring a skateboarder navigating a city-like environment. The scene unfolds along a sidewalk adjacent to a red brick building with visible vents and a black door. The skateboarder moves smoothly, transitioning from the sidewalk to a parking lot area, where vehicles like vans and cars are parked. The sky is clear, indicating fair weather, and the bright daylight casts defined shadows on the ground. The environment is characterized by elements such as street signs and concrete surfaces. Overlay elements serve as a framing component, enhancing the visual context without being intrusive, and are positioned unobtrusively to provide additional context without obstructing the view of the scene.",
    "Spatial": "The video opens with a skateboarder skillfully navigating a sidewalk, captured in a dynamic full shot. The camera closely follows the skateboarder, maintaining a consistent distance and keeping him centered, to emphasize his fluid movements and agility. As he approaches a ramp, he effortlessly jumps over the handrails, showcasing his impressive control. The urban backdrop, featuring static elements like a brick wall and parked vehicles, contrasts with the skateboarder's dynamic motion.\n\nThe perspective shifts to a rear view, highlighting the skateboarder's acceleration and speed as he glides through the environment. The camera captures the seamless flow of his movements against a clear sky, casting sharp shadows that underscore the bright daylight.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
