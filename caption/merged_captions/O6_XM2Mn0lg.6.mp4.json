  "merged_caption": "The video utilizes a close-up shot, with the camera at the subject's level, tightly framing the upper portion of a human figure's hooded head and yellow mask; this figure is positioned centrally in the middle ground. The scene unfolds in a dark forest setting characterized by indistinct, blurred background forms, indicative of a nighttime or deeply shadowed environment. A shadowy humanoid figure, wearing a dull yellow mask on its upper portion, is centrally positioned. This figure is enveloped by a dynamic multitude of sharp, angular, crystalline fragments. Initially facing to the left of the frame, the figure turns its head to its right, facing the camera after the impact. During the shot, a glassy object shatters upon striking the figure or its immediate vicinity, causing numerous sharp, translucent fragments to explode outwards from a central point around the figure. These fragments scatter in all directions, dynamically moving through the foreground and enveloping the figure in the middle ground. These pieces, reflecting bluish-white light, fly outwards from the point of impact. The video is in slow-motion. The camera is at eye-level with a level angle, employing a shallow depth of field that keeps the shattering figure in the foreground in focus. The camera exhibits very smooth, minor movement, panning from left to right. In the background, a blurred, dimly lit forest provides a mysterious and atmospheric setting.",

    "Camera": "The video is in slow-motion. The camera is at eye-level with a level angle, employing a shallow depth of field that keeps the shattering figure in the foreground in focus. The camera exhibits very smooth, minor movement, panning from left to right.",
    "Subject": "A human figure is depicted in close-up, wearing a dark, textured hood that conceals most of its head, and a bright yellow mask, possibly with a segmented design, over its face. This figure is struck by a glassy object, which then shatters upon impact into many sharp, translucent pieces. These pieces, reflecting bluish-white light, fly outwards from the point of impact.",
    "Motion": "A figure in a yellow mask is struck by an object, causing the object to explode into numerous sharp, glassy shards. Initially facing to the left of the frame, the figure turns its head to its right, facing the camera after the impact.",
    "Scene": "The scene unfolds in a dark forest setting characterized by indistinct, blurred background forms, indicative of a nighttime or deeply shadowed environment. A shadowy humanoid figure, wearing a dull yellow mask on its upper portion, is centrally positioned. This figure is enveloped by a dynamic multitude of sharp, angular, crystalline fragments. These fragments resemble transparent glass shards or frozen objects, reflecting light with silvery highlights as they move rapidly around the figure.",
    "Spatial": "The video utilizes a close-up shot, with the camera at the subject's level, tightly framing the upper portion of a human figure's hooded head and yellow mask; this figure is positioned centrally in the middle ground.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
