  "merged_caption": "This bird's-eye view, first-person point-of-view shot is captured from the edge of a high, rocky cliff, looking straight down. In the foreground, the upper portion of a person wearing a bright, fluorescent yellow wingsuit with blue accents on the shoulders and along the front zipper is positioned at the bottom of the frame. The rocky, scree-covered ground of the cliff edge is also visible in the immediate foreground. The middle ground and background are dominated by a vast, deep valley below, which fills the majority of the frame from the center to the top. The valley features steep rock faces, green forested slopes in the top left, and light-colored winding paths or dry riverbeds across the landscape. The camera is positioned high above the valley and exhibits noticeable instability with minor, erratic movements. The lens exhibits mild barrel distortion, causing a slight outward bowing of the image at the edges. A deep focus keeps the entire scene, from the person's body in the immediate foreground to the valley floor far below, sharp and in focus. The person makes slight movements with their body and hands while looking down into the valley below. The steep mountain faces are a combination of sheer rock and scree fields, with strong shadows indicating bright daylight. The camera remains quite unsteady, with small, erratic movements that lack a clear, intentional pattern.",

    "Camera": "From a first-person, bird's-eye perspective, the camera looks straight down from a great height. The lens exhibits mild barrel distortion, causing a slight outward bowing of the image at the edges. A deep focus keeps the entire scene, from the person's body in the immediate foreground to the valley floor far below, sharp and in focus. The camera is quite unsteady, with small, erratic movements that lack a clear, intentional pattern.",
    "Subject": "From a first-person point of view, a person stands on the edge of a rocky cliff. They are wearing a bright, fluorescent yellow wingsuit with blue accents on the shoulders and along the front zipper. The camera is angled downwards, showing the person's upper body and the vast, steep drop into a valley far below.",
    "Motion": "From a first-person perspective, a person wearing a yellow wingsuit stands on the edge of a high, rocky cliff, making slight movements with their body and hands while looking down into the valley below.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures the view from the edge of a high, rocky mountain precipice. The ground is a mix of gray scree and jagged rocks. Looking straight down, a vast valley is visible far below, featuring green forested slopes and light-colored, winding paths or dry riverbeds. The steep mountain faces are a combination of sheer rock and scree fields, with strong shadows indicating bright daylight. The top of a bright yellow jacket with blue accents is visible at the bottom of the view, belonging to the person standing at the cliff's edge.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
