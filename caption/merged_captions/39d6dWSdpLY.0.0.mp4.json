  "merged_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a landscape, captured from an eye-level perspective moving forward with a camera mounted just above the road. The cracked asphalt road originates at the bottom of the frame and recedes toward a central vanishing point on the horizon, acting as a leading line. In the background, a range of snow-capped mountains spans the horizon across the upper portion of the frame, illuminated by the warm, golden light of either sunrise or sunset under a clear sky. The middle ground is occupied by an arid plain on the left and right sides of the road, covered in low, dry brush. As the camera advances in a very smooth, quick, forward dolly shot presented as a time-lapse, the road and the immediate scrubland in the foreground and middle ground rush backward and out of the frame, while the mountains in the background remain relatively fixed. The camera uses a deep focus to keep the entire scene, from the road to the mountains, in sharp detail. A yellow road sign with a bicycle symbol briefly appears in the middle ground on the right, and a car briefly appears driving toward the camera along the road before passing by. Evenly spaced roadside poles line both sides of the road, and the highway features white and yellow painted lines. A reddish-orange lens flare is visible in the top right of the frame, and the clear blue sky fills the top third of the composition. The composition is designed to emphasize the vast scale of the natural environment and evoke the feeling of a journey through an open, expansive landscape.",

    "Camera": "This is a very smooth, quick, forward dolly shot, presented as a time-lapse, moving continuously down the center of a road toward a distant mountain range. Filmed from a level, eye-level perspective, the camera uses a deep focus to keep the entire scene, from the road to the mountains, in sharp detail.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a landscape scenery shot, captured from the perspective of a vehicle moving along a long, cracked asphalt road. The road stretches into the distance, leading the eye toward a majestic range of snow-capped mountains illuminated by the warm, golden light of either sunrise or sunset. The surrounding terrain is an arid plain covered in low, dry brush under a clear blue sky. There is no main subject, as the composition is designed to emphasize the vast scale of the natural environment and evoke the feeling of a journey through an open, expansive landscape.",
    "Motion": "This scenic video captures a long, straight road stretching through a vast, arid landscape toward a majestic range of snow-capped mountains. The peaks are illuminated by the warm, golden light of either sunrise or sunset under a clear sky. The camera provides a forward-moving perspective as if driving down the road.",
    "Scene": "A forward-moving view travels along a straight, two-lane asphalt road through an arid landscape. The road's surface is dark and covered in a network of black, crack-sealing tar lines. On the horizon, a range of tall, jagged mountains with white snow-covered peaks is bathed in an orange glow, illuminated by the warm, golden light set against a clear blue sky. The surrounding terrain is a flat expanse of dry, brown scrubland. A reddish-orange lens flare is visible on the right, and a yellow road sign with a bicycle symbol stands on the shoulder. Evenly spaced roadside poles line both sides of the road, and the highway features white and yellow painted lines. A single car can be seen driving ahead in the distance.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
