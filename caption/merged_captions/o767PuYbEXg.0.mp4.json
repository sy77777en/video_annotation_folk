  "merged_caption": "This full shot, captured from above, initially shows a large marine mammal, likely a whale, mostly submerged, with its dark tail fluke in the center-right foreground creating white foam as it moves towards the top left and dives. The camera is positioned above water, capturing the scene from a high angle and maintaining a deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping the entire scene sharp. As the whale propels itself forward, its tail fluke, initially visible above the water, moves downwards and submerges, creating a splash. The camera initially pans to the right before smoothly tilting upwards. As the whale continues to swim forward mostly submerged, its body becomes a dark shape moving from the center-right towards the center in the middle ground. Simultaneously, a second, larger dark shape, another marine mammal, is visible beneath the surface in the top right of the frame, also moving towards the top left. The deep blue water occupies the entire frame, with white splashes primarily on the right side. As the video progresses, the second whale appears on the right side beneath the white splash, staying submerged and not coming to the surface. The scene captures the dynamic interaction between the whales and the ocean, emphasizing their size and the water's motion. A view from just above the water's surface captures a deep blue ocean during the daytime, with sunlight glinting off the rippling surface. In the top left corner, a \"BBC\" logo overlay is present, consisting of three white letters, each enclosed within a dark square shape.",

    "Subject": "The video features a large marine mammal, likely a whale, swimming in the ocean. The whale is mostly submerged, with its dark, smooth body partially visible above the water's surface. Surrounding the whale, the water is a deep blue, with white foam and splashes indicating movement. As the video progresses, a second whale becomes visible, appearing alongside the first whale as it continues to swim. The scene captures the dynamic interaction between the whales and the ocean, emphasizing their size and the water's motion.",
    "Motion": "A large marine mammal, likely a whale, propels itself forward as its tail fluke, initially visible above the water, moves downwards and submerges, creating a splash.

    "Scene": "A view from just above the water's surface captures a deep blue ocean during the daytime, with sunlight glinting off the rippling surface. A large, dark gray marine animal is visible moving through the water, its powerful tail fluke creating white foam and significant splashes as it propels itself and begins to dive. As the video progresses, a second whale can be seen swimming beneath the surface. In the top left corner, a \"BBC\" logo overlay is present, consisting of three white letters, each enclosed within a dark square shape.",
    "Spatial": "This full shot, captured from above, initially shows a large marine mammal, mostly submerged, with its dark tail fluke in the center-right foreground creating white foam as it moves towards the top left and dives.

Simultaneously, a second, larger dark shape, another marine mammal, is visible beneath the surface in the top right of the frame, also moving towards the top left.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
