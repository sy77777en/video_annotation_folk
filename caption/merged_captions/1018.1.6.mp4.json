  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of an empty, narrow, green train corridor, emphasizing its length and details like the patterned floor and windows on the right side. The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, capturing the scene with deep focus and a large depth of field. It moves smoothly forward at the subject's level, enhancing the sense of depth. As the video progresses, a door near the far end of the corridor opens, and two men enter from the background. The first man, wearing a green cap, green pants, a white short-sleeved shirt with a tie, and a dark green vest, carries a wrapped object that resembles a tree and is positioned in the center of the frame. The second man, dressed in a dark coat, green pants, a white shirt with a tie, and a Santa hat, follows closely behind, slightly to the left, holding a white object. The corridor features pale green walls and a matching ceiling with subtle, curved lines, and the train's interior exudes a retro aesthetic with metallic-finished doors and panels. As the men walk towards the camera, they gradually move from the background into the middle ground, with the first man leading. By the end of the video, they are closer to the camera, filling more of the frame and becoming the primary focus. The camera's forward movement captures the men's progression along the corridor, highlighting the transition from an empty space to one occupied by the two men. The natural light filtering through the large windows with roller blinds pulled down suggests daytime, enhancing the vintage train ambiance. As the men move closer to the camera, their attire and the objects they carry become more visible, adding a sense of motion and activity within the confined space.",

    "Motion": "The video begins with a view of an empty narrow, green train corridor. The first man opens the door at the end of the corridor and enters, wearing a green cap, green pants, a white short-sleeved shirt with a tie, and a dark green vest, carrying a wrapped object that resembles a tree. The second man, dressed in a dark coat, green pants, a white shirt with a tie, and a Santa hat, follows closely behind, holding a white object and closes the door. The men continue to walk down the corridor, with the first man leading. The corridor features a patterned floor and windows on the right side, enhancing the vintage train ambiance.",
    "Scene": "The video showcases the interior of a vintage train carriage with a long, narrow corridor. The setting is indoors, featuring pale green walls and a matching ceiling with subtle, curved lines. The floor has a patterned design with alternating shapes, adding texture to the scene. On the right side of the frame, a row of large windows with roller blinds pulled down allows natural light to filter in, suggesting daytime. On the left side, there is a series of closed compartment doors. The train's interior exudes a retro aesthetic, with doors and panels that have a metallic finish. At the end of the corridor, a door is being opened by a person walking through the hallway, adding a sense of motion and activity within the confined space.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
