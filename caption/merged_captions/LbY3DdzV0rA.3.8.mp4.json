  "merged_caption": "This video features a captivating time-lapse of a thunderstorm transitioning from day to night, captured with a slow panning shot from left to right. The camera is positioned at a low angle, looking up, and performs a smooth pan, maintaining deep focus to keep the entire landscape and sky sharp. The composition is divided, with the sky and clouds occupying five-sixths of the upper frame, while the ground and distant landscape fill one-sixth of the lower frame. Initially, lightning-illuminated storm clouds are located in the bottom background of the frame, set against a deep blue, star-filled sky. Massive, billowing clouds are internally illuminated by frequent flashes of lightning, casting them in vibrant pink and purple hues. A dark cloud mass dominates the right side of the frame. Below the turbulent clouds, a dark, silhouetted landscape stretches across the horizon, punctuated by the twinkling lights of a distant city and the faint outline of power lines on the left. As the time-lapse progresses, the sky darkens, and the illuminated clouds recede while the dark clouds on the right expand. Throughout the sequence, lightning continues to flash within the clouds and strike in the far distance, adding to the dynamic visual experience.",

    "Camera": "This time-lapse video captures the movement of clouds and stars across the night sky. The camera is positioned above the ground at a low angle, looking up. It performs a slow, smooth pan from left to right. A deep focus keeps the entire landscape and sky sharp.",
    "Subject": "This video captures a dramatic landscape scenery shot of a thunderstorm transitioning from day to night. The composition emphasizes the vastness of the environment and the powerful atmospheric phenomena. As the day turns to night, massive, billowing storm clouds are internally illuminated by frequent flashes of lightning, causing them to glow with vibrant pink and purple hues. Below the turbulent clouds, a dark, silhouetted landscape stretches across the horizon, punctuated by the twinkling lights of a distant city and the faint outline of power lines. Occasional, distinct bolts of lightning can be seen striking in the far distance, adding to the dynamic visual experience.",
    "Motion": "This captivating time-lapse video captures a thunderstorm transitioning from day to night. The clouds billow and shift, illuminated from within by flashes of lightning, against the backdrop of a dark, expansive sky.",
    "Scene": "A time-lapse captures a dramatic storm transitioning from day to night over a distant, dark landscape. Against a deep blue, star-filled sky, massive, billowing clouds are illuminated from within by intermittent flashes of lightning, casting them in shades of pink and purple. Below the turbulent clouds, the dark silhouette of the horizon is dotted with the faint glow of distant city lights. On the left, the silhouettes of power lines stand against the illuminated sky. Throughout the sequence, lightning continues to flash within the clouds and strike in the distance.",
    "Spatial": "This video features a slow panning shot from left to right, capturing an extreme wide view of a landscape. The camera is positioned at a low angle, looking up. The composition is divided, with the sky and clouds occupying five-sixths of the upper frame, while the ground and distant landscape fill one-sixth of the lower frame. Initially, lightning-illuminated storm clouds are located in the bottom background of the frame, set against a deep blue sky. A dark cloud mass dominates the right side of the frame. The ground at the bottom extends from the foreground to the background, with silhouetted power lines and distant city lights visible in the middle ground on the bottom left. As the time-lapse progresses, the sky darkens, and the illuminated clouds recede while the dark clouds on the right expand. Lightning flashes intermittently within the clouds in the bottom background."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
