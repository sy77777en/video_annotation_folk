  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium full shot of a man with light-brown skin, long dark dreadlocks, a mustache, and a beard, standing in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. He wears a bright orange, ribbed turtleneck sweater and blue pants. Tall, light-green grass occupies the foreground, partially obscuring his lower body. In his left arm, he carries a piece of firewood, and in his right hand, he holds a small axe with a wooden handle, pointing it forward. The man waves the axe up and down with his right hand while holding a few pieces of firewood under his left arm. The background features dense green foliage, trees, and a wooden deck structure. The scene is set outdoors in a lush, green environment, likely a garden or forested area, with dense foliage and tall trees surrounding a wooden deck. The time of day appears to be daytime, with natural light illuminating the area. The setting includes a rustic structure made of both wood and stone, located in the right middleground, blending with the natural surroundings. The overall atmosphere is serene and natural, with the greenery and wooden elements creating a harmonious blend with the environment. The camera is positioned at the subject's level and maintains a level angle, looking straight ahead. It uses deep focus with a large depth of field, ensuring all elements are sharp. The camera smoothly zooms out, focusing on the man in the middle ground. The shot then changes to a wide shot, capturing more of the surrounding environment.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
