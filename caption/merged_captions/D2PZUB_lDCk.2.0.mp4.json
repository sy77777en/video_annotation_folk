  "merged_caption": "In this abstract scene, a dynamic landscape of shimmering golden particles occupies approximately one-sixth of the bottom of the frame. A bright, concentrated glow emanates from the bottom center of this landscape, serving as a focal point. Numerous thin, vertical lines of golden light rise from this area, extending towards the top of the frame, creating a dynamic and shimmering effect. The top ends of these lines flash a bright point of light at a specific frequency. Smaller, scattered points of golden and white light populate the upper portions of the frame and appear to drift upwards alongside the vertical lines, resembling stars or floating particles. The video features a static camera, but its abstract nature makes it challenging to distinguish the camera's point of view, level, and angle. The dark background is dotted with faint golden particles, and the wavy, golden particle surface at the bottom consistently emits golden waves outward from the center at a regular frequency. The overall framing remains static throughout the clip, with the prominent, bright golden glow near the center of the particle surface from which some light rays appear to originate.",

    "Subject": "The video presents an abstract, animated scene enriched with golden light effects. At the bottom, a wavy surface composed of dense, shimmering golden particles forms a dynamic landscape. From this surface, numerous thin, vertical lines of golden light ascend towards the top of the frame, varying in height and intensity. Some lines culminate in a brighter point of light. Scattered throughout the dark upper portion of the scene are smaller, individual points of golden and white light, resembling stars or floating particles. A prominent, bright golden glow emanates from the center of the particle landscape near the bottom, serving as a focal point from which some light rays appear to originate.",

    "Scene": "The video shows an abstract scene against a dark brown background dotted with faint golden particles. Below, a surface made of shimmering, golden particles forms gentle, wave-like undulations, glowing brightly near the center. From this surface, numerous thin, vertical lines of golden light ascend towards the top of the frame, varying in length and brightness. Smaller, bright golden particles are scattered throughout, appearing to float and move upwards with the light streaks.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
