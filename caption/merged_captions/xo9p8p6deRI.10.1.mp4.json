  "merged_caption": "In a high-angle full shot, a white SUV is positioned in the center-right foreground. Directly behind it in the middle ground, a white sedan is located in the center-left of the frame. Further back, another sedan is parked in the top-left background. A house with a porch and steps is situated in the middle ground on the right side of the frame, while trees are visible on the left and in the background, casting shadows on the ground. The video features an overhead-level camera at a high angle, looking down from above, employing deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera moves forward and downward slowly, with slight unsteadiness and some shaking throughout the clip. The focus is on the vehicles in the scene, with the main emphasis on the boxy SUV in the foreground. The house with a porch and steps is situated in the middle ground, and trees cast shadows on the ground. At the bottom of the frame, yellow text transitions to \"Don't do it O.J.!\" and then changes again, while the scene remains unchanged. The video showcases a monochromatic scene with three cars, focusing primarily on the car closest to the house. This car, a boxy SUV with a distinct front grille and visible side mirrors, is parked nearest to a house with a porch. Behind it, a sedan with a similar boxy design is aligned in the driveway. The third car, also a sedan, is parked perpendicular to the other two on the street, rather than in the driveway. All cars are uniformly colored in a light shade, lacking distinct markings or details. The setting includes a house with visible steps and a window, and trees are present, casting shadows on the ground. The arrangement suggests a driveway or parking area, with the first two cars aligned in a row leading towards the house, while the third car is positioned on the street. The environment is calm, with no visible weather effects.",

    "Scene": "The video depicts an outdoor suburban setting during the day, characterized by a monochromatic color scheme. The scene features a driveway leading to a house with a porch and steps. Two vehicles, a larger SUV and a smaller car, are parked on the driveway. The vehicles and the house are rendered in a uniform, light gray color, lacking detailed textures. Trees with simple foliage are present, casting soft shadows on the ground. The environment is calm, with no visible weather effects. Overlay elements include subtitles at the bottom center of the scene, initially displaying \"[...]\" in yellow text, then changing to \"Don't do it O.J.!\" before reverting back to \"[...]\".",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
