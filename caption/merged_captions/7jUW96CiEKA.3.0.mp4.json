  "merged_caption": "This is an extreme wide shot of a landscape, capturing a vast, open expanse of dry, sandy terrain with sparse vegetation under a sky filled with a mix of clouds and patches of blue. The foreground, occupying the bottom portion of the frame, consists of flat, light-brown sandy ground sparsely covered with small green plants and marked by faint tracks. Stretching across the middle ground is a wide expanse of flat, dry terrain. In the background, a line of trees runs horizontally across the frame, positioned below the sky which fills the top half of the frame and features predominantly white and grey clouds, with some areas of blue visible. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, capturing the scene with deep focus and a large depth of field. It smoothly pans from right to left, revealing more of the barren grassland landscape and the distant tree line, emphasizing the scale and atmosphere of the scene rather than any specific object. The distant tree line and the wide, open sky contribute to the sense of vastness and tranquility. The shot includes a pan to the left, looking across the landscape towards the horizon.",

    "Subject": "The video is a landscape scenery shot. It captures a vast, open expanse of dry, sandy terrain with sparse vegetation, under a sky filled with a mix of clouds and patches of blue. The focus is on the expansive environment, emphasizing the scale and atmosphere of the scene rather than any specific object. The distant tree line and the wide, open sky contribute to the sense of vastness and tranquility.",
    "Motion": "The video shows a vast, barren field with sparse patches of vegetation under a partly cloudy sky. The camera slowly pans from right to left, revealing more of the empty field and the distant tree line.",
    "Scene": "The video displays a wide, outdoor landscape under a cloudy daytime sky. The foreground consists of flat, light-brown sandy ground sparsely covered with small green plants and marked by faint tracks. In the distance, a horizontal line of green trees separates the ground from the sky, which is filled with predominantly white and grey clouds, with some areas of blue visible.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
