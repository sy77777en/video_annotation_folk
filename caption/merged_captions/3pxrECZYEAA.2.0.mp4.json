  "merged_caption": "This wide shot opens with a stylized, animated green tadpole-like creature positioned in the middle ground at the center of the frame, situated between dark, finger-like seaweed structures that occupy both the foreground and background. The creature has a smooth, elongated body with a prominent yellow eye featuring a red pupil, and its sleek, streamlined form is enhanced by a subtle gradient that adds depth. To the right, a red, egg-like circle with a textured, bubbly surface is also visible in the middle ground. As the scene progresses, the tadpole swims horizontally to the left, weaving between the seaweed stalks with a sense of fluidity and grace, while its body undulates smoothly. The camera follows its movement with a smooth tracking shot from the side, moving left and up to keep it in the frame. The dark blue background and the dark green, abstract plant-like shapes provide a stark contrast to the creature's bright colors, emphasizing the striking yellow eye against the green body. The red circle gradually moves out of the frame along with the camera, enhancing the dynamic composition of the scene. The overall environment is characterized by its bold colors and simple, graphic style, creating an animated underwater setting that highlights the creature's graceful motion and the abstract nature of its surroundings.",

    "Camera": "This is a smooth tracking shot that follows a tadpole-like creature from the side, moving left and up to keep it in the frame.",
    "Subject": "The video features a stylized, animated green tadpole-like creature with a smooth, elongated body and a prominent yellow eye with a red pupil. The creature is depicted weaving through dark, abstract plant-like shapes. Its body is sleek and streamlined, with a subtle gradient that adds depth. The yellow eye is striking against the green body, drawing attention to the creature's head. The tadpole's movement through the plants suggests a sense of fluidity and grace. The scene begins with the creature next to a red, egg-like circle before it swims away to the left. The overall scene is characterized by its bold colors and simple, graphic style.",
    "Motion": "A green tadpole-like creature with a prominent yellow eye and a red pupil swims from right to left through a dark, abstract environment filled with tall, dark, plant-like shapes. The creature's body undulates smoothly as it moves, and it maintains a consistent pace throughout the sequence. The background remains dark and filled with the same abstract plant-like shapes, providing a stark contrast to the creature's bright colors.",
    "Scene": "In an animated underwater setting with a dark blue background, dark green, finger-like seaweed structures rise from below. A small, green, tadpole-like creature with large red eyes swims slowly through the aquatic plants. To the right, a round, red object with a textured, bubbly surface gradually moves off the screen as the scene progresses.",
    "Spatial": "This wide shot opens with a green, tadpole-like creature positioned in the middle ground at the center of the frame, situated between dark, finger-like seaweed structures that occupy both the foreground and background. To the right, a red, circular object is also visible in the middle ground. As the scene progresses, the tadpole swims horizontally to the left, weaving between the seaweed stalks, while the camera follows its movement, shifting upward and to the left. The red circle moves out of the frame along with the camera."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
