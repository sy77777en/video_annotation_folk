  "merged_caption": "This is a medium shot, showing the upper bodies of two individuals in white, full-body protective suits with hoods, light blue surgical-style face masks, and transparent eye protection. The primary subject, positioned in the center-right of the frame in the foreground, holds a long-handled tool with a green section near its base and a clear glass beaker clamped at its end. The tool extends towards the center-left, aiming for a square, metallic, reflective container filled with a swirling, iridescent liquid, positioned to the left of the primary subject. A second individual, similarly attired, is visible to the left and slightly in the background relative to the first, holding a cylindrical, possibly metallic, object near the left edge of the square container, also in the foreground. On the far right of the frame, a complex laboratory setup with various pieces of glassware, including round-bottom flasks and tubing, occupies the foreground; some flasks contain liquids. The entire scene is set against a black background, suggesting an indoor, controlled environment, possibly a laboratory. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level and uses a low angle, with an exceptionally shallow depth of field that creates a completely black and indistinct background. It focuses on the midground while exhibiting minor, very smooth counterclockwise arcing movement. The mannequin on the right is carefully maneuvering the beaker towards the metallic container, while the mannequin on the left observes the actions of the mannequin on the right. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays a timestamp \"[23]\".",

    "Subject": "The video features two individuals, their upper bodies visible, clad in identical white, full-body protective suits complete with hoods, light blue surgical-style face masks, and transparent eye protection. The person positioned more centrally and slightly to the right holds a long-handled tool; this tool has a green section near its base and a clear glass beaker clamped at its end. They appear to be maneuvering this beaker towards a square, metallic, reflective container situated to their left. The second individual, located to the left and slightly in the background, wears the same protective attire and holds a cylindrical, possibly metallic, object in their right hand, near the edge of the square container. On the far right of the scene, a complex laboratory setup is visible, comprising various pieces of glassware such as round-bottom flasks and tubing, all mounted on a support stand; some of these flasks contain liquids.",
    "Motion": "The video features two mannequins in white protective suits and face masks, positioned in a laboratory setting. The mannequin on the right is holding a long-handled tool with a green clamp and a glass beaker, carefully positioned over a square, metallic container. The mannequin on the left is holding a cylindrical object, possibly a container or a tool, and is observing the actions of the mannequin on the right. The background is dark, highlighting the mannequins and the laboratory equipment.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set against a black background, suggesting an indoor, controlled environment, possibly a laboratory. Two figures are visible, both clad in white, full-body protective suits with hoods, blue surgical masks, and goggles covering their faces. The figure on the right is more prominent and is manipulating a long, metallic tool with a green handle. At the end of this tool is a clear, cylindrical glass container. To the left, a second, similarly attired figure stands slightly behind, holding a metallic object. Between them and slightly to the left is a square, metallic container filled with a swirling, iridescent liquid. On the far right, a complex arrangement of laboratory glassware, including flasks and tubing, is visible. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays a timestamp \"[23]\".",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
