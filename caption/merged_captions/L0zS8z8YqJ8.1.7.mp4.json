  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot, a central, wood-paneled compartment is positioned in the middle ground, framed by a dark gray structure in the foreground. Within this central compartment, two chrome-colored, featureless humanoid figures with a smooth, metallic surface are seated on a bench to the left, and two more are on a facing bench to the right. On the back wall between them, a light gray suit jacket and a darker gray overcoat hang from hooks. To the left and right of this main view, smaller, rounded-corner cutouts show partial views of similar interiors. The camera, with a deep focus keeping the entire scene sharp, smoothly moves backward and downward, revealing a second, more crowded compartment below, which becomes the new central focus. In this final wide shot, the camera is positioned above the subjects, looking down into the lower compartment where six chrome figures are seated, three on each facing bench. The hanging coats are no longer present in this more crowded layout. The figures in both scenes remain motionless throughout the video. As the view pulls back and moves downward, a black horizontal line separates the upper section from a lower one, revealing another, more crowded compartment with more silver figures seated inside. The camera then slowly advances to reveal the details of the lower level's interior, maintaining a clear view of the entire scene.",

    "Camera": "With a deep focus keeping the entire scene sharp, the camera smoothly moves backward and downward to shift from one floor of the structure to the one below. It then slowly advances to reveal the details of the lower level's interior.",
    "Subject": "A 3D animation displays a cross-section of a wood-paneled compartment populated by stylized, chrome-colored humanoid figures. These figures are featureless and have a smooth, metallic surface. Initially, four of these figures are shown sitting on two facing benches, two figures per bench. On the back wall between them, a light gray suit jacket and a darker gray overcoat hang from hooks. The scene then transitions to show a different configuration within the same type of compartment. In this second arrangement, there are six of the chrome figures, three on each side, sitting on the facing benches. The hanging coats are no longer present in this more crowded layout.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a view of a 3D animated cross-section of a compartment containing four stationary figures. The camera then moves backward and downward to reveal a second, more crowded compartment below, which contains six stationary figures. The figures in both scenes remain motionless.",
    "Scene": "A 3D rendering displays a cross-section of a vehicle's interior, framed within a larger, dark gray structure. The main compartment, seen through a central rectangular cutout, is lined with light wood paneling and has a door at the far end, flanked by two hanging gray jackets. On either side, light brown upholstered benches face each other, occupied by several silver, humanoid figures. The dark gray framing structure also features smaller, rounded-corner cutouts to the left and right, offering partial views of similar interiors. As the view pulls back and moves downward, a black horizontal line separates the upper section from a lower one, revealing another, more crowded compartment with more silver figures seated inside.",
    "Spatial": "In a wide shot, a central, wood-paneled compartment is positioned in the middle ground, framed by a dark gray structure in the foreground. Within this central compartment, two chrome figures are seated on a bench to the left, and two more are on a facing bench to the right. To the left and right of this main view, smaller cutouts show partial views of similar interiors. The camera, initially at the subjects' level, pulls back and moves downward, revealing a second, more crowded compartment that becomes the new central focus. In this final wide shot, the camera is positioned above the subjects, looking down into the lower compartment where six chrome figures are seated, three on each facing bench."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
