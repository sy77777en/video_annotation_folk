  "merged_caption": "This is a largely static close-up shot of a person lying in the center of the frame. A dark, polka-dotted blanket extends from the foreground to the background, occupying the top portion of the frame and partially obscuring the view. The person, with fair skin, is wearing a light-colored plaid shirt and is positioned on their side with an arm bent near their head. Their torso is located in the background, seen from under the blanket, with their head, shoulder, and arm filling the central and bottom parts of the composition. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, using a shallow depth of field with the focus set on the person in the background. The scene is dimly lit, mostly in shadow, with a sliver of ambient light illuminating a small portion of the person's face and clothing. From under the blanket, a portion of their face is visible, revealing one open eye. As the video progresses, the person opens their eyes, raises their front arm, and slightly looks up towards the end of the video. The camera remains static with a slight, natural unsteadiness throughout the scene.",

    "Subject": "In a dimly lit scene, a person with fair skin is lying face downward and leftward on the bed, partially obscured by a dark, polka-dotted blanket. They are wearing a light-colored plaid shirt and are positioned on their side with an arm bent near their head. From under the blanket, a portion of their face is visible, revealing one open eye.",

    "Scene": "From a perspective under the covers, a person lies in a dimly lit bed. They are wearing a light-colored plaid shirt and are partially obscured by a dark duvet cover featuring a light, circular pattern.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
