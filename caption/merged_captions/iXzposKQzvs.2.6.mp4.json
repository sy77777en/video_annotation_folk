  "merged_caption": "A full shot initially frames a young woman with light skin and blonde hair tied back in a bun, wearing a solid blue one-piece swimsuit, standing on a springboard in the center-right and middle ground. The pool is visible at the bottom of the frame, with judges seated on the left side of the background and spectators, many wearing masks, in the background at the top. The video is set within a large, modern indoor natatorium during a diving event, with a large blue banner displaying the \"TOKYO 2020\" logo and Olympic rings. From an overhead, second-floor height, the camera begins at a level angle and pans left to follow the diver onto the diving board. Positioned at the diver's level, the camera follows as she takes several preparatory bounces on the end of the board, then launches into the air. As she jumps, the camera smoothly tilts up, capturing her forward somersault in a pike position as she wraps her hands around the back of her knees and folds her torso against her legs while keeping her calves straight and aligned with her thighs. The camera then tilts down, tracking her descent as she straightens her body just before reaching the water. The shot shifts to a high-angle view for her entry into the water, focusing on the center of the frame as she enters the pool headfirst, creating a large splash. The pool surface fills the entire view, maintaining a deep focus with a large depth of field throughout.",

    "Subject": "A young woman with light skin and blonde hair tied back in a bun performs a dive from a springboard. She is wearing a solid blue one-piece swimsuit. She takes a few preparatory bounces on the end of the board, then launches into the air, wrapping her hands around the back of her knees and folding her torso against her legs while keeping her calves straight and aligned with her thighs. She straightens her body just before entering the bright blue water headfirst, creating a large splash. In the background, several men in suits and face masks sit on elevated chairs, and a crowd of spectators, many also wearing masks, watches from tiered stadium seating.",

    "Scene": "The video is set within a large, modern indoor natatorium during a diving event. A bright blue swimming pool occupies the lower portion of the view, with several light blue springboards extending over it. In the background, tiered spectator seating is partially occupied, and a large blue banner displays the \"TOKYO 2020\" logo and Olympic rings. A female diver in a blue swimsuit executes a dive from one of the springboards, moving through the air before entering the water and creating a significant splash. The camera follows the diver's trajectory from the board into the pool.",
    "Spatial": "A full shot initially frames a female diver in the center-right and middle ground, standing on a springboard. The pool is visible at the bottom of the frame, with judges seated on the left side of the background and spectators in the background at the top. The camera, positioned at the diver's level, follows as she moves to the center of the frame and leaps from the board. The camera then tilts down, tracking her descent. The shot concludes with a view from above the subject, focusing on the center of the frame as she enters the water, with the pool surface filling the entire view."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
