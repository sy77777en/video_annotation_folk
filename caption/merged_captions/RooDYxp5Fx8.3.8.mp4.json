  "merged_caption": "The video captures a wide shot of an urban street scene, highlighting the full extent of the sidewalk and road as they stretch from the foreground to the background. The camera, likely handheld due to the slight shaking, is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, looking straight ahead. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping all elements sharp. The camera moves forward along the sidewalk, following the direction of the perspective, providing a dynamic view of the environment. On the left side of the frame, modern buildings with glass and concrete facades are visible, extending into the background. The sidewalk, lined with trees and bordered by small bushes, is fairly centered in the frame, running parallel to the road. On the right side, the street and a small portion of the buildings on the opposite side are visible. A white truck is parked near the curb with orange traffic cones around it, while several vehicles, including another white truck, move away from the camera along the road, adding dynamism to the scene. Pedestrians walk along the sidewalk, and a construction worker in a white safety helmet is seen working on a shop by the street. Additionally, a pedestrian holding a white umbrella walks towards the camera and passes by. The sky at the top of the frame is clear and blue, indicating pleasant weather. As the camera advances, some people and objects that were initially in the foreground gradually disappear from view, offering a natural perspective of the street and its surroundings. The presence of pedestrians and moving cars adds to the lively city vibe, emphasizing the overall environment and the interaction of urban elements, highlighting the scale and energy of city life.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
