  "merged_caption": "This is a medium shot centered on a large, anthropomorphic blue-gray cat with a light gray belly, a white muzzle, and yellow eyes, positioned in the foreground. He is flanked by two smaller figures: an angel cat on a cloud to the left and a devil cat on a cloud to the right, creating a balanced composition. The scene is set in a dark, wet alley at night, featuring a prominent brick wall and a large, dark pipe in the foreground. The real-world background includes out-of-focus lights visible in the far background on the right. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level, using a static, eye-level shot with a level angle, seamlessly integrating a real-world background with 2D animated characters. The real-world scene uses a shallow depth of field to keep the foreground in focus, while the 2D characters remain consistently sharp and clear. Spatially, the central cat turns his head from left to right, his expression shifting from a slight smile to a frown. The devil cat on the right, depicted as a red cat with horns and a pointed tail, gestures with its right hand toward the central cat, then moves closer to the camera while swinging its right arm widely. Meanwhile, the angel cat on the left, a gray cat dressed in a white robe with a halo and harp, slightly shakes on its cloud, holding the harp and gesturing with its right hand before the red devil's movements. The wetness of the surfaces, including the brick wall and large, dark pipe, suggests recent rain, adding to the scene's atmospheric depth.",

    "Subject": "A large, anthropomorphic blue-gray cat with a light gray belly, a white muzzle, and yellow eyes stands in the center, looking leftward or rightward as his expression shifts from a slight smile to a frown. He is flanked by two smaller, cartoonish figures. On his right, a gray cat dressed as an angel in a white robe stands on a small cloud, holding a golden harp and wearing a white halo. On his left, a red cat depicted as a devil with horns and a pointed tail stands on another small cloud, holding a red trident and gesturing toward the central figure.",
    "Motion": "The large cat in the center turns his head from left to right, his expression shifting from a slight smile to a frown. To his left, the red devil figure gestures with its right hand toward the central cat, then moves closer to the camera while swinging its right arm widely.

    "Scene": "The scene is set in a dark, wet alley at night, featuring a prominent brick wall and a large, dark pipe in the foreground. A large, blue-gray cat character stands in the center. In the foreground, two small cats flank the central character: on the left, a gray cat dressed as an angel with a halo and harp stands on a white cloud, and on the right, a red cat dressed as a devil with a trident stands on another white cloud. The background is dark, with some out-of-focus white lights visible on the right, and the wetness of the surfaces, including the brick wall and large, dark pipe, suggests recent rain.",
    "Spatial": "This is a medium shot centered on a large, blue-gray cat positioned in the foreground. He is flanked by two smaller figures in the foreground: an angel cat on a cloud to the left and a devil cat on a cloud to the right, creating a balanced composition. In the real-world background, a dark pipe is situated on the left against a brick wall in the foreground, with out-of-focus lights visible in the far background on the right. Spatially, the central cat turns his head from left to right. The devil cat on the right gestures as its cloud moves slightly forward and toward the camera, while the angel cat on the left remains in the same position. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
