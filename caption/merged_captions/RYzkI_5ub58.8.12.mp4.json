  "merged_caption": "A full shot captures an insect, likely a moth or skipper, in the center of the frame, resting on a thick, bright green plant stem that extends diagonally from the bottom left corner towards the top left. The insect's body is predominantly dark, possibly greenish-brown, and covered in fine hairs, with a distinct patch of dense, orange-yellow hairs located solely on the top of its head. Its wings, held partially open and angled upwards over its back, are dark with subtle greenish and brownish hues, featuring a noticeable, iridescent purple or blue spot on the visible upper surface. The insect has long, slender, black antennae that are slightly thickened or clubbed at the tips and extend forward, with its large, compound eyes being a prominent reddish-brown. Several slender, dark legs with fine bristles are visible, with the insect using them to cling to the textured surface of the green stem. The background consists of a soft-focus blur of green, yellow, and light blue, suggesting an outdoor, sunlit environment. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, using an extremely shallow depth of field to keep the moth in the midground in sharp focus while the background is heavily blurred. This is a static, slightly unsteady shot filmed from a level angle, with the framing remaining static throughout the video. The insect remains stationary on the plant stem, with only its antennae moving sporadically.",

    "Scene": "In a full shot, a moth-like insect with brownish-green wings rests on a plant stem that appears thick due to the macro perspective. The insect features a fuzzy, orange-hued head, dark compound eyes, and long, thin black antennae. A small, iridescent purple spot is visible on one of its wings. The background is a soft-focus blur of green and light blue, with a distinct yellow blur, suggesting an outdoor, sunlit environment.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
