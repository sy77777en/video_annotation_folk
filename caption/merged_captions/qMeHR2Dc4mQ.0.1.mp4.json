  "merged_caption": "In a close-up shot, a man with dark skin, short dark hair or bald, a dark mustache, and a short beard is initially seen in profile on the right side of the frame, facing towards the left and looking ahead. He is wearing a light-colored t-shirt. The scene is extremely dark, with a single dim light source illuminating the right side of his face, leaving the rest of his features and the background in shadow. His skin has a noticeable sheen. As the video advances, the camera, captured in slow motion from a smooth, eye-level angle with an extremely shallow depth of field, gradually reveals more of his features as he runs, with noticeable movement in his body. The focus remains fixed on the man in the foreground. His head gradually shifts from an initial side profile to a more direct angle toward the camera, revealing his wide eyes and a slightly open mouth as he shifts from a profile to a three-quarter view, positioned in the center-right of the frame. The lighting illuminates only one side of his face, leaving the other in deep shadow, and the background remains obscured by the enveloping darkness. The camera's movement is unclear due to the lack of background cues, but it remains at his eye level throughout the shot.",

    "Camera": "This slow-motion video is captured from a smooth, eye-level camera at a level angle. It utilizes an extremely shallow depth of field, with the focus fixed on the man in the foreground. The camera's movement is unclear due to the lack of background cues.",
    "Subject": "A man with dark skin is shown in a dimly lit environment. He has short, dark hair or is bald, and he has a dark mustache and a short beard. Initially seen in profile, his head gradually shifts from an initial side profile to a more direct angle toward the camera, revealing wide eyes and a slightly open mouth. He is wearing a light-colored t-shirt. The lighting illuminates only one side of his face, leaving the other in deep shadow.",
    "Motion": "The camera begins with a profile view of a man's face, gradually revealing more of his features as he runs, with noticeable movement in his body.",
    "Scene": "In a nearly pitch-black environment, a man's face is partially illuminated by a single, dim light source from the side, creating deep shadows that obscure the background entirely. His skin has a noticeable sheen, and his head gradually shifts from an initial side profile to a more direct angle toward the camera, revealing his wide eyes. The setting is undefined, consisting only of the enveloping darkness around him.",
    "Spatial": "In a close-up shot, a man's face is initially seen in profile on the right side of the frame, facing towards the left of the frame and looking ahead. The scene is extremely dark, with a single light source illuminating the right side of his face, leaving the rest of his features and the background in shadow.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
