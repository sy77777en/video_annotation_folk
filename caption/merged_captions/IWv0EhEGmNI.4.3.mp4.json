  "merged_caption": "The video begins from a first-person perspective, with a textured, speckled wall filling the background, and a long, horizontal ladder positioned above it at the top of the frame. Two gloved hands are briefly visible on either side of the frame in the foreground, moving upwards as the person wearing tactical gloves climbs an exterior staircase of a building. The camera exhibits mild barrel distortion and moves upward, maintaining a level angle. Subtitles are overlaid at the bottom center, while HUD elements are present as overlays on the left and bottom right. The view then moves upward and transitions to a tiled rooftop that occupies most of the middle ground, extending from the bottom to the top of the frame. Upon reaching the rooftop, a rifle with a scope appears in the bottom center-right foreground, indicating preparation for further action. The camera quickly pans slightly left and tilts downward to survey the area, employing deep focus to keep a large depth of field, with its movement slightly unsteady and some shaking. The setting is viewed through a night vision effect, casting a green tint over the scene, suggesting a military or covert operation, likely within a first-person shooter game. The industrial or urban environment features textured walls and rooftops, contributing to a tense atmosphere. Overlays include subtitles at the bottom: \"Al-Qatala Fighter 2: Power's out. I'm going to check the fusebox.\" The camera maintains an eye-level perspective relative to the environment, with the overlays remaining in their respective positions throughout.",

    "Camera": "The video exhibits mild barrel distortion. From a first-person perspective in a game, the camera moves upward as the player climbs a ladder to a rooftop, maintaining a level angle.

    "Subject": "The video showcases a scene with a night vision effect, casting a green tint over everything. A person wearing tactical gloves is seen climbing an exterior staircase of a building and then ascending to the rooftop, where they retrieve a rifle. The presence of firearms and night vision equipment suggests a military or covert operation, likely within a first-person shooter game. The setting appears to be an industrial or urban environment, with textured walls and rooftops visible. The atmosphere is tense, with the person seemingly on a mission, as indicated by the dialogue about checking a fusebox.",
    "Motion": "A person wearing tactical gloves climbs an exterior staircase of a building, moving steadily upward. Upon reaching the rooftop, they retrieve a rifle, indicating preparation for further action. The setting is viewed through a night vision effect, casting a green tint over the scene.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, navigates a dark environment under a green night-vision filter. The scene begins with a close-up view of a rough, speckled surface, likely the exterior wall of a building, with a long, horizontal ladder above it. The scene then transitions as the character moves onto a tiled rooftop at night. The rooftop features rows of dark, rectangular, overlapping tiles. A rifle with a scope is visible in the lower portion of the view. Overlays include subtitles at the bottom: \"Al-Qatala Fighter 2: Power's out. I'm going to check the fusebox.\" A HUD is also present, displaying a vertical numerical bar on the left and weapon and ammunition indicators on the bottom right.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
