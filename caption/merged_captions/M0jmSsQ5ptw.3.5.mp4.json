  "merged_caption": "This full shot is captured from a high angle, looking down at a model biplane positioned in the center-left of the frame in the middle ground. The biplane, painted a light tan color, features a large roundel with a blue outer circle and a red center on its top wing, and vertical stripes of blue, white, and red on the tail rudder. Its struts are painted with red and white stripes, and a light blue patch on the fuselage displays the red number \"4\". A person is seated in the plane's open cockpit. A thick black rope hangs in the right foreground, suspended from a wooden structure that occupies the top of the frame. To the left, a dry, grassy field extends into the background. On the right, a paved surface runs from the bottom of the frame into the background, where a person on a bicycle is visible on the runway. In the far background, low mountains stand under a partly cloudy sky across the horizon. The camera, mounted to a wooden structure, captures the scene from a smooth, high-angle, overhead perspective with mild barrel distortion and deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera pans smoothly to the left, tracking the biplane model as it flies gracefully in midair. The plane glides smoothly, its wheels not visibly turning as it soars above the ground.",

    "Camera": "This video is captured from a smooth, high-angle, overhead perspective, exhibiting mild barrel distortion. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp. The camera pans smoothly to the left, tracking a biplane model as it flies gracefully in midair.",
    "Subject": "A model biplane, painted a light tan color, is the central subject. Its top wing is marked with a large roundel consisting of a blue outer circle and a red center. The tail rudder features vertical stripes of blue, white, and red. On the side of the fuselage, a light blue patch displays the red number \"4\". The struts connecting the upper and lower wings are painted with red and white stripes. In the foreground, a thick, black, braided rope hangs down. A bicycle is visible in the background on a paved surface.",
    "Motion": "From a high-angle perspective, a model biplane flies through the air. In the background, a person on a stationary bicycle is visible. The plane glides smoothly, its wheels not visibly turning as it soars above the ground.",
    "Scene": "From a locked-on POV shot mounted to a wooden structure, the perspective looks down on a vintage-style model biplane. The scene is set outdoors during the day at an airfield, with a paved runway next to a vast, dry, grassy field. The biplane is tan with a blue, white, and red roundel on the top wing and matching vertical stripes on the tail rudder; its struts are painted with red and white stripes. A person is seated in the plane's open cockpit. In the background, low mountains stand under a partly cloudy sky, and another person can be seen on a bicycle on the runway.",
    "Spatial": "This full shot is captured from a high angle, looking down at a model biplane positioned in the center-left of the frame in the middle ground.

The camera follows the airplane as it moves to the left."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
