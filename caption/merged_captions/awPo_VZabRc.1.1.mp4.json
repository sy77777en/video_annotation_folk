  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot from a subject-level perspective, capturing a pale-skinned man with an angular face, unkempt dark hair, and shadows over his eyes caused by his browline, standing in the center of the frame and the middle ground of a subway car aisle. He is wearing a long black coat over a white t-shirt and dark pants. To his left and right, other passengers are seated in the middle ground, while a figure in a red jacket faces the camera in the left foreground. The scene is set inside a subway car, rendered in a stylized, hand-drawn animation with a muted color palette of grays, desaturated greens, and browns. The car's interior features a long central aisle with a dark, gridded floor, flanked by rows of simple, tan-colored bench seats. Rectangular fluorescent lights line the ceiling, while the windows show only darkness. The camera captures the scene from a level, eye-level angle that moves forward, meeting the man as he walks down the aisle with his arms outstretched, holding onto the handrails. As he takes large steps forward, the seated passengers around him, initially depicted as ordinary people, abruptly transform into monstrous, non-human creatures. To his left, a seated, bald passenger becomes an insectoid creature holding a book, which it still holds after transforming, and other seated passengers reveal grotesque features, including multiple eyes and distorted faces. The camera then moves forward, transitioning to a close-up that centers on the man's serious face, with the surrounding passengers, now transformed into monsters, visible in the background. The shot continues to tighten as the man in the black coat approaches the camera, ending on an extreme close-up that fills the center of the frame with one of his large, dark eyes, utilizing a deep focus to keep the man, the other passengers, and the interior of the car in sharp detail.",

    "Camera": "This animated scene is captured from a level, eye-level camera angle that moves forward, meeting a man as he walks down the aisle of a subway car. As the camera and the man move towards each other, he becomes progressively larger in the frame. The shot utilizes a deep focus, keeping the man, the other passengers, and the interior of the car in sharp detail.",
    "Subject": "The main subject is a pale-skinned man with an angular face, unkempt dark hair, and shadows over his eyes caused by his browline, who walks down the aisle of a subway car. He is wearing a long black coat over a white t-shirt and dark pants. As he walks with his arms outstretched, the other passengers around him, who are initially depicted as ordinary people, transform into monstrous, non-human creatures. To his left, a seated, bald passenger becomes an insectoid creature holding a book, which it still holds after transforming, and other seated passengers reveal grotesque features, including multiple eyes and distorted faces. The camera zooms in on the main subject's serious face and then focuses on one of his large, dark eyes.",
    "Motion": "A man in a black coat stands in the aisle of a subway car, holding onto the handrails with his arms outstretched. As he takes large steps forward, the seated passengers around him abruptly transform into monstrous creatures. He approaches the camera closely, causing his eyes to appear wide open.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set inside a subway car, rendered in a stylized, hand-drawn animation with a muted color palette of grays, desaturated greens, and browns. The car's interior features a long central aisle with a dark, gridded floor, flanked by rows of simple, tan-colored bench seats. Rectangular fluorescent lights line the ceiling, while the windows show only darkness. Initially occupied by human passengers, the scene transforms as a central figure wearing a black coat and a white shirt walks down the aisle. His presence triggers the transformation of the seated figures into monstrous, alien-like creatures with varied, grotesque features.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a wide shot from a subject-level perspective, capturing a man in a black coat standing in the center of the frame and the middle ground of a subway car aisle.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
