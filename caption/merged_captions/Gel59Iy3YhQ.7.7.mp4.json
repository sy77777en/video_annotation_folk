  "merged_caption": "The video presents a full shot of a large, dark, monstrous creature with glowing red eyes and prominent, sharp, antler-like or branch-like protrusions extending from its head and along its back. Initially positioned in the center-left middle ground, the creature is in a low, hunched, quadrupedal-like stance with large, clawed hands and feet, and a long, slender tail. The scene is set in a dim, misty, and fantastical outdoor environment, likely at dusk or dawn, under a purple-tinged sky. In the background, red beams of light crisscross upwards in the center, surrounded by floating rocky formations in the upper center and silhouetted, gnarled, leafless trees on the left and right sides in the middle ground and background. A dark, reflective surface occupies the bottom foreground. The creature first shifts its weight and turns its head slightly to its right, then begins to move towards the left side of the frame. It raises its torso and head while advancing its right front limb and left hind leg. Subsequently, it lowers its head and torso, planting its right front limb and moving its left front limb forward in a crawling motion. The creature then turns and crawls forward, moving from the left towards the center-left and becoming more prominent in the middle ground. The camera is at ground level, employing a low angle and deep focus with a large depth of field. It moves backward very smoothly, leading the dark, ominous creature from the front, maintaining the subject's level throughout. The ground appears to be a dark, reflective surface that mirrors the faint light from above, enhancing the eerie atmosphere of the scene.",

    "Subject": "A large, dark, monstrous creature with glowing red eyes is depicted. Its body is mostly a silhouette, with prominent, sharp, antler-like or branch-like protrusions extending from its head and along its back. The creature is in a low, hunched, quadrupedal-like stance, with large, clawed hands and feet, and a long, slender tail.",
    "Motion": "The large, dark creature, initially in a low, hunched stance, subtly shifts its weight and turns its head slightly to its right. It then raises its torso and head while advancing its right front limb and left hind leg. Subsequently, it lowers its head and torso, planting its right front limb and moving its left front limb forward in a crawling motion.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set in a dim, misty, and fantastical outdoor environment, likely at dusk or dawn, under a purple-tinged sky. In the background, prominent red beams of light crisscross upwards, illuminating floating, dark, rocky formations and gnarled, leafless trees. The ground appears to be a dark, reflective surface that mirrors the faint light from above. A large, dark, ominous figure with glowing red eyes and antler-like protrusions on its head is in a low, crouching stance in the foreground, its form largely silhouetted against the brighter background. The creature crawls to the left side of the screen and then crawls forward, gradually moving into the center of the frame.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
