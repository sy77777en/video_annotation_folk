  "merged_caption": "The video is presented from a first-person perspective, with the lower center of the frame consistently occupied by a sleek, modern black assault rifle, which remains in the foreground throughout. The heads-up display overlays are fixed in the frame: the mini-map and player information are in the bottom left, the ammunition count is in the bottom right, and orange diamond-shaped objective markers appear near the center. The scene begins with the viewpoint positioned behind a dark structure on the right foreground, with \"7208-JITE\" stenciled in white, and the two-story, unfinished concrete building in the middle ground, surrounded by scattered trees and green bushes in the background. An explosion occurs near the center foreground, producing a cloud of dust and smoke that partially obscures the view. The player, holding the black assault rifle, moves forward through the arid, dusty outdoor environment towards the two-story building, navigating around trees and open space. The camera swiftly pans and moves around the battlefield, maintaining a deep focus on all elements. After being shot, the player's view quickly pans to the left and moves forward before retreating behind the building for cover. The camera then moves forward and slightly right, transitioning from the open area into the shadowed area at the base of the two-story building, shifting the building to occupy more of the center middle ground and right foreground. The player stops at the base of the exterior staircase, suggesting an objective or exploration within the game. The camera height remains at the eye level of the player character, maintaining a consistent perspective relative to the environment, indicating a multiplayer setting.",

    "Camera": "This video is shot from the unsteady, eye-level perspective of a player in a first-person shooter game. The camera swiftly pans and moves around a battlefield. After being shot, the player's view quickly pans to the left and moves forward before retreating behind a building for cover. The entire scene is captured in deep focus, keeping all elements sharp.",
    "Subject": "The video showcases a first-person shooter game scene. The main subject is a player holding a black assault rifle. The rifle itself is sleek and modern in design. Separately, there is an overlay on the screen displaying ammunition count and other data, which is not physically attached to the rifle but part of the game's user interface. The player navigates through an outdoor environment featuring a two-story building with a staircase on the exterior. The building is surrounded by trees and open space. On-screen graphics include a mini-map and player information, indicating a multiplayer setting. The player moves towards the building, suggesting an objective or exploration within the game.",
    "Motion": "The player, holding a black assault rifle, moves forward through an outdoor environment towards a two-story building. They navigate around trees and open space, approaching the building's exterior staircase. The player stops at the base of the stairs. Throughout the movement, on-screen graphics display ammunition count and player information, indicating a multiplayer setting.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, takes place in a bright, sunny, outdoor environment with an arid, dusty landscape. The setting features a two-story, unfinished concrete building with open window frames, surrounded by scattered trees and green bushes. The viewpoint starts behind a dark structure with \"7208-JITE\" stenciled in white. A large orange explosion erupts near the concrete building, kicking up a cloud of dust and smoke. Following the explosion, the viewpoint moves to the shadowed area of the two-story building. The scene is overlaid with a heads-up display (HUD), which includes a rectangular minimap in the lower-left corner, an ammunition count in the lower-right, and orange diamond-shaped objective markers in the central view. The lower portion of the view is consistently occupied by a black firearm.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
