  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a middle-aged, light-skinned man with a light-colored goatee, wearing a light-colored helmet with red and black lettering, dark sunglasses, and a black wingsuit with yellow and white sleeves. A black skull design is visible on the white fabric wings of his suit, and a blue strap is across his chest. His face is positioned in the upper-center foreground, with a rocky mountain range visible in the middle and background below him. The scene captures a wingsuit flight through a vast, rocky mountain range during the daytime, with a bright and sunny sky. The camera, mounted on the front of a skydiver’s helmet, begins from a high angle, exhibiting mild barrel distortion and deep focus, keeping both the man and the mountainous background sharp. Initially, the man flies forward with his arms tucked in, then extends his arms outward, spreading the fabric wings of his suit to reach the left and right edges of the frame. His upper torso and outstretched arms remain consistently in the frame throughout the sequence. As he brings his hands back in to grasp two blue straps near his chest, the camera moves backward, leading the subject from the front. The angle shifts from a high angle to an upside-down high angle, capturing the dynamic movement as the mountain scenery rushes past in the background. Near the end, as he deploys a parachute-like device, the camera shakes intensely and rapidly tilts, transitioning to an upside-down high angle. The craggy, grey mountain faces, interspersed with patches of green vegetation, are visible below and in the background, enhancing the dramatic aerial perspective of the wingsuit flight.",

    "Camera": "This aerial-level video, captured from a camera mounted on the front of a skydiver’s helmet, begins from a high angle and films him as he flies forward. The shot exhibits mild barrel distortion, and a deep focus keeps both the man and the mountainous background sharp. Leading the subject from the front, the unsteady camera moves backward, and near the end, as he deploys a parachute-like device, the camera shakes intensely and rapidly tilts, transitioning to an upside-down high angle.",
    "Subject": "A middle-aged, light-skinned man with a light-colored goatee is shown in a full shot, in a skydiving posture. He is wearing a light-colored helmet with red and black lettering, dark sunglasses, and a black wingsuit. The suit has yellow and white sleeves with a black skull design on the white fabric wings of his suit, and a blue strap is visible across his chest. He initially looks directly at the camera with an intense expression and his mouth slightly open, extending his arms to spread the fabric wings of his suit, and then withdraws both hands to hold two blue straps that extend from the strap across his chest.",
    "Motion": "A man in a wingsuit flies forward over a mountainous landscape, initially with his arms tucked in. He then extends his arms out to the sides, spreading the fabric wings of his suit, before bringing his hands back in to grasp two blue straps near his chest.",
    "Scene": "From a locked-on POV shot where the camera is mounted to a person, the scene captures a wingsuit flight through a vast, rocky mountain range during the daytime. The sky is bright and sunny. The person, wearing a light-colored helmet and dark sunglasses, is seen from a close, wide-angle perspective as they glide through the air. They extend their arms, unfurling the fabric wings of their suit, which are white and black with a skull graphic on the inner surface, and yellow on the sleeve. Below and in the background, the craggy, grey mountain faces, interspersed with patches of green vegetation, are visible.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a full shot of a man, with his face positioned in the upper-center foreground and a rocky mountain range visible in the middle and background below him. As he extends his arms outward, the wings of his suit expand to reach the left and right edges of the frame. His upper torso and outstretched arms remain consistently in the frame throughout the sequence. The camera angle shifts from a high angle to an upside-down high angle, capturing the dynamic movement as the mountain scenery rushes past in the background. it's always a full shot, not closeup or medium shot"

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
