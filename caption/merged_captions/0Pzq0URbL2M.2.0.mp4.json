  "merged_caption": "A full shot frames a large, weathered tombstone with a rounded top in the center foreground, silhouetted against a dusky, purple-hued sky. The tombstone, with its rough texture, stands prominently, while its base and the surrounding grass occupy the bottom of the frame. Two small, broken pieces rest at its base. The camera, positioned at a level angle, smoothly zooms in, maintaining a shallow depth of field that keeps the tombstone in focus, enhancing the details of its weathered surface. In the middle ground and background, numerous other tombstones are visible as dark silhouettes across the scene, contributing to the cemetery's somber atmosphere at dusk. A small, bright orb of light is positioned in the background, slightly to the right of the center on the horizon, adding a focal point against the darkening sky. As the camera continues to zoom in, the focus remains on the large tombstone, while the hazy background of silhouetted tombstones and the orb of light provide depth and context to the scene. The dusky sky fills the top portion of the frame, completing the atmospheric composition.",

    "Scene": "An outdoor scene is set in a cemetery at dusk. In the foreground, a large, weathered stone tombstone with a rounded top is silhouetted against a dark purple sky. The ground is covered in grass, and in the hazy background, numerous other tombstones are visible as dark shapes. A small, bright orb hangs low on the horizon. The tombstone in the foreground has a rough texture, and two small, broken pieces rest at its base.",
    "Spatial": "A full shot frames a large tombstone in the center foreground, with its base and the surrounding grass occupying the bottom of the frame. The camera gradually zooms in on the large tombstone, enhancing the focus on its details while maintaining a static position at the subject's level. In the middle ground and background, numerous other tombstones are silhouetted across the scene. A small, bright orb of light is positioned in the background, slightly to the right of the center on the horizon, while the dusky sky fills the top portion of the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
