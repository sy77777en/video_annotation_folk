  "merged_caption": "This video presents a dynamic, extreme wide, high-angle aerial shot of a vast waterscape at either dawn or dusk. A sandy peninsula, which hosts numerous long, narrow blue boats and a small, rustic wooden hut, is positioned in the bottom right foreground. The camera smoothly trucks left while panning right, creating a slow, sweeping view of the landscape. The large, calm body of water, possibly a large river or reservoir with a greenish hue, extends from the foreground through the middle ground, where several low-lying, sparsely vegetated islands are scattered; a distinct island sits in the center, with larger land formations on the left. The background is composed of flat, green plains that stretch across the upper portion of the frame, meeting an overcast sky tinged with soft pink and purple hues at the distant horizon. The aerial view dynamically captures the serene landscape, revealing exposed sandbanks and small, green islands that dot the water, indicating a low water level. In the foreground, a sandy landmass crowded with dozens of beached long-tail boats and a small, simple shelter adds to the tranquil scene. A few people are visible on the shore near the boats, emphasizing the small human presence within the vast natural environment. The video uses a level-angle perspective to emphasize the immense scale of the natural environment and create a serene, atmospheric mood. The composition highlights the relationship between the water, the land, and the small human presence, rather than focusing on any single element.",

    "Camera": "From a level aerial perspective, the camera captures the tranquil waters and a small peninsula with docked boats in deep focus. The camera smoothly trucks left while panning right, creating a slow, sweeping view of the landscape.",
    "Subject": "This is an aerial landscape scenery shot of a vast, tranquil river or lake under a soft, overcast sky tinged with pink and purple hues. The expansive body of water is dotted with low-lying, sandy islands and peninsulas, one of which hosts a small settlement with a simple wooden structure and numerous long, narrow boats moored along its shore. In the distance, flat, green plains stretch to a hazy horizon.

In the foreground, a sandy landmass crowded with dozens of beached long-tail boats and a small, simple shelter adds to the serene landscape.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone provides an aerial view of a vast, tranquil waterscape at either dawn or dusk. The scene is dominated by a large, calm body of water with a greenish hue, its low levels exposing sandy peninsulas and small, sparsely vegetated islands. An overcast sky with soft pink and purple tones hangs above a hazy, flat landscape in the distance. In the foreground, a sandy stretch of land serves as a mooring point for numerous long, narrow blue boats, which are gathered near a small, rustic hut. A few people are visible on the shore near the boats.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
