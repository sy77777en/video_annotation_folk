  "merged_caption": "In a pixel art video game scene, a 2D wide gaming shot presents a fixed, side-view of a symmetrical, multi-level indoor stage that fills the scene. The structure is composed of dark blue and purple brick platforms and walls, accented with icy formations, set against a dark, starry void with faint, stylized patterns. The scene is framed on the left and right by an ornate, dark purple border. Initially, a purple-robed character, designated as P2, spawns on a platform in the bottom center-left, while a crowned character, designated as P1, spawns on a corresponding platform in the bottom center-right. Overlays for \"P2\" in purple and \"P1\" in blue, with an orange crown icon above \"P1,\" appear above the left and right characters, respectively, but soon disappear before they start to move. The camera remains level with the overall scene throughout, occasionally shaking as the figures move. The purple-robed character performs a series of jumps, moving left and right, reaching higher up on the left side of the structure, and is ultimately shot dead by an arrow. Concurrently, the crowned character performs three successive jumps to ascend the platforms on the right side. Both characters reach platforms on the far left and right, where small golden chests are located. As they reach these platforms, white text reading \"DRILL ARROWS\" appears as an overlay on both the left and right sides of the screen. Several torches with red-tipped flames are fixed on the background patterns. At the beginning, the overlay text \"ROUND 4 FIGHT!!\" appears in the center of the frame but disappears quickly.",

    "Scene": "A side-view 2D gaming video captures a symmetrical, multi-level indoor stage with a pixel art style. The structure is composed of dark blue and purple brick platforms and walls, accented with icy formations. The background is a dark, starry void with faint, stylized patterns. Several torches with red-tipped flames are fixed on the background patterns. Small golden chests appear on platforms on the far left and right. The scene is framed on the left and right by an ornate, dark purple border. At the beginning, the overlay text \"ROUND 4 FIGHT!!\" appears in the center of the frame but disappears quickly. The overlays in the bottom center initially display \"P2\" in purple and \"P1\" in blue, with an orange crown icon above \"P1.\" Subsequently, white text reading \"DRILL ARROWS\" appears as an overlay on both the left and right sides of the screen.",
    "Spatial": "This 2D wide gaming shot presents a fixed, side-view of a symmetrical, multi-level video game stage that fills the scene. Initially, a purple-robed character is positioned on a platform in the bottom center-left, while a crowned character is on a corresponding platform in the bottom center-right. The purple character then jumps up to a higher platform on the far left, and the crowned character jumps to a platform on the far right, where chests are on both sides of the platform. Overlays for \"P1\" and \"P2\" are initially above the right and left characters but soon disappear before they start to move. Later, when they reach the platforms with golden chests, the \"DRILL ARROWS\" text overlays appear sequentially above them on the right and left sides of the screen. The entire scene is set against a dark, starry background and is framed by ornate borders on the far left and right. The camera remains level with the overall scene throughout."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
