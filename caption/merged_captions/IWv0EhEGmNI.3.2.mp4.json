  "merged_caption": "From a first-person perspective, the shot begins with a high-angle view where a pair of hands wearing dark, textured gloves are securing a thick, light-colored rope around a large wooden post prominently framed in the foreground, with a portion of a rifle visible in the left middle ground. The left wrist features a dark-colored band with a watch-like device. A digital heads-up display (HUD) with numerical data is positioned on the left. The camera begins at a hip-level, high-angle view, characterized by intense, unsteady shaking and a varying Dutch angle, focusing on the hands as they use a metal carabiner to fasten the rope to the post. The camera then tilts upward, transitioning to an eye-level, level-angle view that reveals a misty town with lights glowing in the windows of its buildings in the distant background, with the shaking becoming milder. The perspective captures the scene at night through a green-tinted night vision filter, maintaining a deep focus throughout, keeping both the immediate foreground and the distant background sharp. Subsequently, the hands toss a coiled portion of the rope downwards from the bottom of the frame, unfurling into a long, glowing cyan line that travels through the center of the scene, stretching from the foreground towards the dark backdrop of the town below.",

    "Camera": "From a first-person perspective, the camera begins at a hip-level, high-angle view, focusing on a pair of hands securing a rope. This initial shot is characterized by intense, unsteady shaking and a varying Dutch angle. The camera then tilts upward, transitioning to an eye-level, level-angle view that looks out over a dark, foggy town, with the shaking becoming milder. A deep focus is maintained throughout, keeping both the immediate foreground and the distant background sharp.",
    "Subject": "From a first-person perspective seen through a green night-vision filter, a pair of hands wearing dark, textured gloves secures a thick, light-colored rope around a large wooden post. The left wrist features a dark-colored band with a watch-like device. The hands use a metal carabiner to fasten the rope to the post. Subsequently, a coiled portion of the rope is thrown downwards, unfurling into a long, glowing cyan line against the backdrop of a dark, distant town with illuminated buildings.",
    "Motion": "From a first-person perspective, a pair of gloved hands wraps a rope around a wooden post and fastens it with a metal carabiner. The hands then toss a coiled section of the rope downwards from a high vantage point. The rope unfurls as it descends, glowing against the dark backdrop of a town below.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a scene at night through a green-tinted night vision filter. Gloved hands are shown securing a light-colored rope with a metal carabiner to a thick, textured wooden post in a grassy area. The perspective then tilts upward to a level angle, revealing a view from a high elevation overlooking a misty town with lights glowing in the windows of its buildings. The rope is thrown and uncoils, appearing as a bright green line against the dark landscape as it falls. A green digital heads-up display (HUD) with numerical data is present as an overlay on the left side of the view.",
    "Spatial": "From a first-person perspective, the shot begins with a high-angle view where a pair of gloved hands are securing a rope to a large wooden post prominently framed in the foreground, with a portion of a rifle visible in the left middle ground. A digital heads-up display is positioned on the left. The camera then tilts upward, transitioning to a level-angle shot that reveals a misty town with illuminated buildings in the distant background. Finally, a coiled rope is thrown from the bottom of the frame, unfurling as a glowing line that travels through the center of the scene, stretching from the foreground towards the town in the background."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
