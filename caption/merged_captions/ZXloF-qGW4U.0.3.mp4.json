  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot of a young, light-skinned man with short, dark hair, wearing a dark suit jacket, a white collared shirt, and a dark tie, positioned in the right foreground, walking toward the camera down a narrow, red-lit corridor. His expression appears serious. The scene is set within a dark, narrow indoor hallway, completely saturated in a deep red light. Behind him, two other figures are visible as silhouettes in the middle ground, one in the center and one slightly to the left. As the man in the suit walks forward, he turns his head slightly, consistently accompanied by one of the silhouetted figures, who is positioned in the middle ground throughout the scene. The camera captures this with a slightly unsteady, handheld lead-tracking shot, filmed from an eye-level, level angle, moving backward with a shallow depth of field, keeping the man in the foreground in focus. As the main subject moves forward, he remains positioned in the right foreground, and the shot tightens into a medium close-up. A person wearing a fedora-style hat becomes visible in the middle ground center, following him in the dimly lit corridor, while the two figures previously in the middle ground have receded into the background. The camera maintains its focus on the man in the suit, emphasizing his forward motion through the dark, red-lit corridor.",

    "Camera": "This is a slightly unsteady, handheld lead-tracking shot of a man in a suit, filmed from an eye-level, level angle, with the camera moving backward. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the man in the foreground in focus.",
    "Subject": "A young, light-skinned man with short, dark hair is the main subject, walking forward in a dark, red-lit corridor. He wears a dark suit jacket, a white collared shirt, and a dark tie, and his expression appears serious. Following behind him is another man, mostly rendered as a dark silhouette, distinguished by the fedora-style hat he is wearing.",
    "Motion": "A man in a suit walks forward through a dark, red-lit corridor, turning his head slightly as he advances. He is consistently accompanied by one of the silhouetted figures, who is positioned in the middle ground throughout the scene, while another silhouette follows in the middle ground.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set within a dark, narrow indoor hallway, completely saturated in a deep red light. Several figures, appearing as dark silhouettes, move through the confined space. A man in a suit and tie is visible in the foreground, with two individuals behind him who appear to be police officers. They engage in a brief conversation with him but do not follow. The person wearing a hat is the one who continues to follow him down the dimly lit corridor.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
