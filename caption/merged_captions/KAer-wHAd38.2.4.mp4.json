  "merged_caption": "The video presents an extreme wide shot of a serene rural landscape, with the camera positioned above a concrete road that runs from the bottom center of the frame, extending from the foreground to the background, leading towards the horizon. The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, looking straight ahead. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping all elements sharp. The camera moves forward smoothly along the road, slightly panning left as it turns, and towards the end, it slightly pans to the right while continuing to move forward, with no noticeable shaking. On either side of the road, lush green fields stretch from the foreground to the background, occupying the lower left and lower right of the frame. Utility poles are evenly spaced along the left side of the road, extending from the foreground to the background, providing a sense of depth and perspective. The expansive sky, filled with scattered fluffy clouds, dominates the top half of the frame, creating a dynamic and ever-changing atmosphere. In the background, rural houses are visible on the right side, with rolling hills further beyond, adding layers to the scene. Power lines run parallel to the road, enhancing the sense of scale and leading the viewer's eye through the composition. At the far end of the road, a person is riding an electric scooter towards the camera, adding a touch of life to the scene. The vibrant green of the fields contrasts with the deep blue of the sky, creating a vivid and tranquil scene. The absence of a specific main subject allows the viewer to appreciate the harmonious blend of natural and man-made elements, highlighting the peaceful coexistence of human infrastructure and the natural landscape.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
