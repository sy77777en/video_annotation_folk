  "merged_caption": "This video is an extreme wide shot of a nighttime landscape, with no specific subjects. The scene is framed with a thin line of distant city lights positioned along the bottom of the frame in the background. Above this, a vast, dark storm cloud occupies the majority of the frame, stretching from the left edge across the center and top. A small area of clearer sky is visible in the bottom right, just above the horizon. The camera is positioned at a low height, slowly panning to the right, looking across the flat terrain towards the immense sky. This is a greatly accelerated time-lapse video of a storm at night, captured from a low angle above the ground. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp as it pans slowly and smoothly from left to right. Suddenly, powerful lightning strikes occur within the cloud, primarily illuminating the upper left and central portions of the frame. This flash reveals the turbulent, purple interior of the cloud and a bright, branching lightning bolt in the upper left before the scene returns to darkness. The focus is on the immense scale and atmosphere of the weather event rather than a specific subject. The scene is set against a dark, flat horizon punctuated by the distant, twinkling lights of a city. Above, a vast and ominous storm cloud, initially cloaked in darkness, is suddenly and spectacularly illuminated from within by several massive lightning strikes, causing a large portion of the sky to erupt in a brilliant, glowing purple. Within this vibrant luminescence, the turbulent, streaked texture of the cloud becomes visible, along with the bright, branching form of the lightning bolts themselves.",

    "Motion": "This brief video captures a dramatic nighttime scene over a distant city. Some massive lightning strikes suddenly illuminate a large storm cloud in a vibrant purple color. The flash is momentary, quickly returning the sky to darkness.",
    "Scene": "At night, a vast, dark storm cloud looms over a distant city skyline, separated from the sky by a thin line of glowing lights on the horizon. To the right, a small patch of clearer, dark blue sky is visible. Several sudden, powerful flashes of lightning occur within the massive cloud, illuminating it from the inside with a brilliant white glow. The brief flashes reveal the turbulent, purple-textured interior of the storm before the scene returns to darkness.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
