  "merged_caption": "In a wide, side-view shot, the scene initially frames two large, gray landmasses separated by a central chasm, set against a hazy, light gray background. A timer is positioned in the top left within a black, angular frame, showing elapsed time with red digital numbers. A small, red, cube-shaped character appears in the center and jumps into the chasm. The camera, from a side-on perspective, smoothly tracks the red, square-shaped character as it falls vertically down a long, narrow shaft, sliding along both the right and left-hand walls lined with red, serrated hazards. As the character descends through several jagged sections, the camera pans down, following the character as it remains centered in the frame. Upon reaching the bottom, the character lands on a small ledge and immediately leaps to the left, hitting a small, suspended platform and bouncing into the air. The camera subtly shifts leftward and continues to move downward, concluding by framing the character on the left, with a large cliff face occupying the right side of the frame and a mechanical structure supporting the platform from the left. The environment is composed of large, gray, blocky platforms and structures with irregular, jagged edges, and the edges of many platforms and vertical surfaces are lined with a continuous row of small, red, sharp-looking spikes. At the top of the scene, faint silhouettes of what appear to be cranes or catapults are visible, and a black, angular, cage-like structure contains a white rectangle displaying red digital numbers. The character's movement from a high platform, down the hazardous chasm, and onto a lower platform supported by a mechanical arm with chains is captured in this minimalist, monochromatic world.",

    "Subject": "A small, red, cube-shaped character is the central subject. The environment is composed of large, gray, blocky platforms and structures with irregular, jagged edges. The edges of many of these platforms and vertical surfaces are lined with a continuous row of small, red, sharp-looking spikes. At the top of the scene, a black, angular, cage-like structure contains a white rectangle displaying red digital numbers.",
    "Motion": "A small, red cube falls vertically down a narrow chasm, sliding along both the right and left-hand walls. After descending through several jagged sections, it lands on a small ledge at the bottom. From there, it immediately leaps to the left, hitting a small, suspended platform and bouncing into the air.",
    "Scene": "In a side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene in profile, the setting is a minimalist, monochromatic world composed of gray, blocky platforms and cliffs suspended against a hazy, light gray background. The environment features a deep chasm separating two large landmasses, with the vertical walls of the chasm and the edges of some platforms lined with red, serrated hazards. On the top of the two landmasses, faint silhouettes of what appear to be cranes or catapults are visible. The scene shows movement from a high platform, down the hazardous chasm, and onto a lower platform supported by a mechanical arm with chains. An overlay in the top left corner displays a timer within a black, angular frame, showing elapsed time with red digital numbers.",
    "Spatial": "In a wide, side-view shot, the scene initially frames two large, gray landmasses separated by a central chasm. A timer is positioned in the top left. A small, red, cube-shaped character appears in the center and jumps into the chasm. The camera pans down, following the character as it descends through the center of the frame between hazardous, red-spiked walls. The character then moves toward the left, remaining in midair at the end. The camera's movement concludes by framing the character on the left, with a large cliff face occupying the right side of the frame and a mechanical structure supporting the platform from the left."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
