  "merged_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of a young boy with pale skin and black hair styled in a bowl cut, positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, seated at a light brown wooden desk while wearing a white shirt and a green knitted vest. A small, dark green pencil rests on the left side of his desk, also in the middle ground. Partially visible desks flank him on the left and right sides, in the middle ground, with two classmates partially visible beside him. In the background, a light-colored wall displays several blank white papers, and a light blue and green globe on a stand is visible on the right side. Sunlight illuminates the scene, primarily from the right, streaming in from an unseen window. The camera is at eye level and maintains a level angle, employing a shallow depth of field to keep focus on the boy at the desk in the middle ground. The boy has his fingers interlaced and shakes his head slightly, turning to the right to glance in that direction before facing forward again. Notably, a green vine with leaves is depicted growing out of the boy's nose. Towards the end of the shot, a blurry, dark gray silhouette of a woman holding a book moves from the right to the left in the foreground, briefly obstructing the view of the boy as she passes. The camera remains completely static, keeping its focus on the boy even when the woman enters closer to the camera.",

    "Camera": "The camera is at eye level and maintains a level angle. It employs a shallow depth of field, keeping focus on a little boy at a desk in the middle ground. Even when a woman enters closer to the camera towards the end, the focus remains on the boy. The camera is completely static.",
    "Subject": "The video features a young boy with pale skin and black hair styled in a bowl cut, sitting at a desk while wearing a white shirt and a green knitted vest. Two classmates are partially visible beside him. Notably, a green vine with leaves is depicted growing out of the boy's nose. Toward the end of the video, a woman holding a book walks across the screen from right to left in front of him.",
    "Motion": "The boy, sitting at a desk in a classroom with a globe in the background, has his fingers interlaced. On either side of him, classmates are seated. A green vine is growing out of his nose. He shakes his head slightly and turns to the right, glancing in that direction, before facing forward again. A woman holding a book walks from right to left in front of the boy, partially obscuring him as she passes.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set in a classroom, with a light brown wooden desk positioned in the middle ground, flanked by two additional desks on either side of the screen. A small, dark green pencil rests on the central desk. In the background, a light-colored wall features several blank white papers and a light blue and green globe on a stand, located on the right side of the screen. Sunlight streams in from an unseen window, illuminating the scene. A blurry, dark gray silhouette of a woman briefly obstructs the view.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
