  "merged_caption": "A full shot captures a blue 3D model of a man standing in the center of the frame and in the foreground. He is rendered entirely in a shimmering, textured blue color and depicted wearing what appears to be a historical military uniform, consisting of a belted tunic, loose-fitting trousers, and tall boots. The man stands at attention with his head tilted up and to his left, his right hand resting near his waist, and his left arm held behind his back. He is positioned on a brown, textured floor marked with a glowing golden grid pattern that extends into the distance against a solid black background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level and uses a deep focus, capturing the full-length, blue, crystalline figure of the person. Throughout the shot, the camera slowly zooms out, causing the man to appear smaller while remaining completely stationary. This smooth, slow shot maintains an eye-level perspective, emphasizing the holographic-like quality of the figure standing in the center of the frame. White overlay text \"[34,35]\" is positioned at the lower left corner of the frame.",

    "Camera": "This is a very smooth, slow shot from a level, eye-level camera. The camera uses a deep focus and slowly zooms out from the blue, holographic-like figure standing in the center of the frame.",
    "Subject": "A 3D model of a man, rendered entirely in a shimmering, textured blue color, stands in a static pose. He is depicted wearing what appears to be a historical military uniform, consisting of a belted tunic, loose-fitting trousers, and tall boots. The man is standing at attention, with his head tilted up and to his left. His right hand rests near his waist, and his left arm is held behind his back.",
    "Motion": "The 3D model of a man remains completely stationary throughout the video.",
    "Scene": "In a dark, undefined space, a full-length, blue, crystalline figure of a person stands at the center. The figure is dressed in a uniform-style outfit with a tunic, pants, and tall boots. It is positioned on a brown, textured floor marked with a glowing golden grid pattern that extends into the distance against a solid black background. The camera slowly zooms out from the figure. White overlay text \"[34,35]\" is positioned at the lower left corner of the frame.",
    "Spatial": "A full shot captures a blue 3D model of a man standing in the center of the frame and in the foreground. He is positioned on a brown, gridded floor that occupies the bottom of the frame, set against a black background. Throughout the shot, the camera slowly zooms out, causing the man to appear smaller. The camera is positioned at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
