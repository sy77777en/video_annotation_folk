  "merged_caption": "The video is filmed from a high angle, presenting a full shot of a black, metallic semi-automatic handgun extending from the foreground in the bottom left to the middle ground on a dark wooden surface, its form highlighted by cool blue light. In the foreground, two brass-cased bullets with silver-colored tips are situated at the bottom right, slightly blurred due to the shallow depth of field, while a portion of a cut-glass tumbler containing an amber liquid is visible in the middle ground on the left. A colorful butterfly enters the frame from the top right, briefly fluttering toward the bottom left. Following this, a small, brightly colored tree frog with a yellow back, a white underside, and pinkish-red limbs hops into view from the top right edge, landing on the gun's trigger guard in the center. The frog, notable for its large red eyes with dark brown irises and a reddish-tinged sclera, pauses momentarily, glances upward toward the top left, and then leaps off the gun, exiting the frame toward the top left. The camera maintains a static shot throughout, with the gun extending from the foreground into the midground, where it remains in clear focus.",

    "Camera": "This is a static shot filmed from ground level with a high-angle perspective. The camera maintains a shallow depth of field, with the bullet positioned entirely in the foreground and slightly blurred, while the gun extends from the foreground into the midground, with the midground portion in clear focus.",
    "Subject": "A black, metallic semi-automatic handgun lies on its side on a dark wooden surface, its form highlighted by cool blue light. In the foreground, next to the gun, are two brass-cased bullets with silver-colored tips. Midway through the scene, a vibrant butterfly enters from the top right corner, flutters briefly toward the bottom left, and then exits the frame. Following this, a small, brightly colored tree frog with a yellow back, a white underside, and pinkish-red limbs hops into view from the top right edge. The frog, notable for its large red eyes with dark brown irises and a reddish-tinged sclera, lands on the gun's trigger guard. It pauses momentarily, glances upward toward the top left, and then leaps off toward the top left edge, disappearing from sight.",
    "Motion": "A colorful butterfly briefly flits into the frame from the top right, moving toward the bottom left. Following this, a small, colorful tree frog hops into the frame from the top right, landing on the trigger guard of the handgun. After a brief pause, the frog leaps off the gun and exits the frame toward the top left.",
    "Scene": "In a dimly lit indoor setting, a black semi-automatic pistol with a metallic sheen rests on a dark wooden surface. The scene is cast in a cool, deep blue light, with a cut-glass tumbler containing an amber liquid partially visible to the left. Around the midpoint of the video, a colorful butterfly enters from the top right corner of the frame and flits toward the bottom left, appearing only briefly. Following this, a small, brightly colored yellow and green tree frog with red eyes appears on the slide of the pistol before vanishing. Two brass-cased bullets are positioned in the lower right foreground of the frame, near the firearm.",
    "Spatial": "The video is filmed from a high angle, presenting a full shot of a handgun extending from the foreground in the bottom left to the middle ground. In the foreground, two bullets are situated at the bottom right, while a portion of a glass is visible in the middle ground on the left. A colorful butterfly enters the frame from the top right, briefly fluttering toward the bottom left. Following this, a small frog enters from the top right, landing on the gun's trigger guard in the center, before leaping out of the frame toward the top left."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
