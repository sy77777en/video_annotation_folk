  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a medium close-up of a man with dark hair and prominent dark sideburns, wearing a dark formal jacket over a white high-collared shirt and a colorful, intricately patterned cravat or waistcoat. He is positioned slightly left of center, facing slightly to his left, possibly indicating his attention is directed toward something just outside the frame. A light-colored mantelpiece edge is visible in the middle ground, running horizontally across the lower portion of the frame. The background features an opulent room with out-of-focus candlelight creating bokeh effects, primarily in the center-right and left side. The camera is at eye level and maintains a level angle, fixed but slightly unsteady. The man lifts his head and speaks while maintaining his gaze in the same direction. The camera then executes a rack focus, causing the man in the foreground to blur while bringing into focus the reflection of a woman in a large mirror that occupies the background. Her reflected head and shoulders, with deep brown hair styled in short waves, are positioned slightly to the right of the mirror's center and in the lower-middle of the overall frame. She is looking towards the man. In-focus candles become visible in the background within the mirror's reflection, notably positioned behind the woman. Ornate, gilded wall details frame the mirror in the background. The scene is set indoors, in a dimly lit, opulent room, likely during the evening or night, as suggested by the warm glow of numerous candles. The overall ambiance is one of historical elegance, with a focus on the rich textures and warm, flickering light.",

    "Camera": "The camera is at eye level and maintains a level angle. It is fixed but slightly unsteady. The focus shifts from the man in the foreground to the reflection of a woman in a mirror in the background.",
    "Subject": "The video initially focuses on a man with dark hair, prominent dark sideburns, and a serious expression. He is wearing a dark formal jacket over a white high-collared shirt and a colorful, intricately patterned cravat or waistcoat. He is positioned facing slightly to his left, possibly indicating his attention is directed toward something just outside the frame. The focus then shifts to a reflection in a mirror behind him, revealing a woman. Only her head and shoulders are visible in the reflection; she has deep brown hair styled in short waves and is looking towards the man.",
    "Motion": "The man, initially facing slightly to his right, lifts his head and speaks while maintaining his gaze in the same direction. As the camera's focus moves to a woman's reflection in a mirror behind him, the woman, initially facing forward, turns her head to look towards the man.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set indoors, in a dimly lit, opulent room, likely during the evening or night, as suggested by the warm glow of numerous candles. The background, observed as a reflection in the large mirror, features ornate, gilded wall details and figures within the room. A prominent, light-colored edge of a wooden or stone mantelpiece is visible in the middleground, likely reflecting the edge of a mirror. The overall ambiance is one of historical elegance, with a focus on the rich textures and warm, flickering light.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
