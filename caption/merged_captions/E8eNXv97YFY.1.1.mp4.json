  "merged_caption": "This is a wide, low-angle scenery shot capturing a large, reddish-brown stone monument with a multi-tiered, pagoda-style roof, centrally framed in the middle ground. The monument, known as the Independence Monument in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, is designed in a traditional Khmer style and stands at the center of a public space. The sky, filled with fast-moving clouds, occupies most of the frame in the background, with a bright, hazy sun partially obscured. In the background, a modern city skyline with several buildings and skyscrapers is visible on the left and right sides of the central monument. Small trees and flags are positioned in the middle ground around the monument. A few small figures of people are visible at the bottom of the frame on the monument's stepped base. The video is a greatly accelerated time-lapse shot from a low-angle, eye-level perspective, featuring a dynamic camera movement in a counterclockwise arc around the monument. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. As the camera moves, it captures the dramatic movement of clouds sweeping across the sky, with the sun shining through them. During the camera's counterclockwise arc, a flagpole can be seen entering from the right side of the foreground, moving to the left, and eventually disappearing from the frame on the left side. The scene is set during late afternoon or early evening, as the sun casts a glow behind the clouds. The composition emphasizes the overall atmosphere and grand scale, focusing on the relationship between the imposing monument, the turbulent sky, and the surrounding urban environment rather than on a specific object or person.",

    "Camera": "This is a greatly accelerated time-lapse video of a monument, shot from a low-angle, eye-level perspective. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The shot features an unsteady counterclockwise arc around the central monument.",
    "Subject": "This video captures a dramatic cityscape scenery shot, featuring a large, reddish-brown stone monument with a multi-tiered, pagoda-style roof. The monument is centrally framed against a dynamic, time-lapse sky filled with fast-moving clouds that partially obscure a bright, hazy sun. In the background, a modern city skyline with several buildings provides a contrasting backdrop. There is no single main subject, as the shot's composition emphasizes the overall atmosphere and grand scale, focusing on the relationship between the imposing monument, the turbulent sky, and the surrounding urban environment rather than on a specific object or person.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenic time-lapse shot of a large, ornate monument in an urban setting, featuring a dynamic camera movement in a counterclockwise arc around the monument. The video captures the dramatic movement of clouds across the sky as the sun shines through them, with a few people visible around the base of the monument.",
    "Scene": "A time-lapse video shows the Independence Monument in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, against a dramatic sky. The large, reddish-brown stone monument, designed with a multi-tiered, ornate roof in a traditional Khmer style, stands at the center of a public space. In the background, the modern city skyline includes several buildings and skyscrapers. The scene is set during late afternoon or early evening, as the sun, partially obscured, casts a glow behind fast-moving clouds that sweep across the sky. A few small figures of people can be seen on and around the monument's stepped base, which is flanked by small trees and flags.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
