  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot of a winter landscape. Initially, a stationary snowplow is visible in the center middle ground, with a snow-covered path extending from the foreground toward it. The scene is flanked by large snow banks in the middle ground and a forest of tall evergreen trees with dark green foliage in the background, their trunks partially covered in snow. The ground is blanketed in a thick layer of snow, creating a smooth, white surface. The camera, positioned at eye level height, maintains a level angle and deep focus, capturing the scene with a slight handheld shakiness yet remains relatively stable. It smoothly pans from right to left in a half-circle motion, gradually unveiling the snowy landscape. As the camera continues to pan, a large, single-story wooden house with a sloped roof, covered in snow, comes into view on the left side of the frame. The house has a dark exterior and is surrounded by a snow-covered driveway that fills the foreground. A small vehicle is visible parked to the left of the house in the middle ground. The expansive view of the snow-covered ground, trees, and house highlights the natural beauty and scale of the winter setting. The sky is overcast, casting a soft, diffused light over the landscape, with light snowfall gently descending, enhancing the serene and calm atmosphere typical of a winter day in a remote, wooded area. A snowplow is visible, suggesting recent clearing activity, and a small vehicle is parked nearby, further enhancing the sense of place and mood.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
