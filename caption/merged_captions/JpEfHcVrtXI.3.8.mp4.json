  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot filmed from an elevated angle above the subject's level, a small figure in a bright yellow raincoat, which obscures their face and adds an atypical appearance against the dim surroundings, is positioned in the center of the middle ground, climbing on top of a wooden chest. The figure is approximately half the height of the bed in the frame, suggesting a child-like or diminutive stature. To the right of the figure, a metal-frame bed with white bedding occupies the center middle ground, with a tall wooden crate to its right. A bucket is visible in the bottom-left foreground. The background features a wall made of metal panels at the back of the room, extending to form the right wall, where a wooden crate is positioned in the foreground. On the left side of this background wall, there is a bulkhead door with a small porthole through which a dim beam of light shines. The figure, whose features are obscured by a hood, drops from the chest and moves to the right, going under the bed. As the figure moves beneath the bed, a light source held in its hand illuminates the floor, shifting the focal point of light to the area under the bed frame. The camera, in an eye-level, level-angle shot with deep focus, smoothly tracks the avatar, a small figure in a yellow raincoat, as they move around the room and hide under the bed. The lighting highlights the yellow raincoat, emphasizing its vividness in the otherwise shadowy environment. The space is dimly lit, containing a simple metal-frame bed with a white mattress, a wooden chest positioned next to the foot of the bed, and a tall wooden crate with a mug placed on top to the right.",

    "Camera": "This is an eye-level, level-angle shot with a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp. The camera smoothly tracks the avatar, a small figure in a yellow raincoat, as they move around the room and hide under a bed.",
    "Subject": "The video features a small figure wearing a bright yellow raincoat with a hood, which obscures their face and adds an atypical appearance against the dim surroundings. The figure is approximately half the height of the bed in the frame, suggesting a child-like or diminutive stature. The raincoat is the most striking element, contrasting sharply with the dark, muted tones of the room. The figure interacts with a bed, which has a simple metal frame and white bedding, and a wooden chest nearby. The lighting highlights the yellow raincoat, emphasizing its vividness in the otherwise shadowy environment.",
    "Motion": "A small figure in a yellow raincoat climbs onto a wooden chest, turns around, and descends back to the floor. They then switch on a flashlight before crouching and walking underneath the adjacent metal-framed bed, moving from the left side to the right.",
    "Scene": "In a third-person 3D game video where the entire character is visible on screen, the scene is set within a dark, sparsely furnished room with bluish-gray walls and a wooden plank floor. The space is dimly lit, containing a simple metal-frame bed with a white mattress, a wooden chest positioned next to the foot of the bed, and a tall wooden crate with a mug placed on top to the right. A small, round porthole on a bulkhead door at the back wall allows light to shine through. The right wall appears to have the metal edges of a window. A small figure in a bright yellow raincoat moves from standing on the chest to hiding under the bed, at which point a small light illuminates the floor beneath the bed frame.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
