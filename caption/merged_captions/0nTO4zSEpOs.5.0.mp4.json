  "merged_caption": "The video showcases a wide shot of an indoor urban setting, featuring a long, covered walkway with a sleek, contemporary design. The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, capturing the scene with deep focus and a large depth of field. Initially, the walkway stretches into the background, with the ceiling's exposed beams and smooth flooring dominating the upper and lower portions of the frame. On the right side, large windows or glass walls reveal well-lit interiors, likely shops or restaurants, extending from the foreground to the background. The video begins with a view of a spacious, well-lit corridor with a high ceiling. The corridor has a few wooden benches on the left side and a series of restaurants on the right, with a blue door curtain hanging above one of the entrances. As the camera moves forward smoothly while panning to the right, more of the restaurants and their signs become visible, including a digital display board and a chair placed outside. The camera continues straight in the same direction while moving diagonally forward to the left, focusing on the entrance of a restaurant. As the video progresses, the camera moves forward and pans right, bringing a blue fabric banner with white text into clearer view. Initially appearing in the middle ground on the right side, the entrance with the banner shifts to the foreground as the camera approaches, with the banner ultimately positioned in the upper right of the frame. The digital display board, located to the left of the entrance, ends up slightly left of center at the bottom of the frame, suggesting a restaurant entrance. Decorative elements like potted plants and wooden benches are placed along the walkway, adding greenery and warmth to the scene. An escalator is visible further back on the left side, enhancing the modern feel of the space. The camera's movement is smooth, maintaining a steady pace as it transitions from the initial wide view of the walkway to a closer focus on the banner and display board. The watermark \"VIRTUAL JAPAN.TV\" remains consistently in the lower left corner.",

Most elements remain stationary, with only a distant, inconspicuous person walking. The camera continues to move closer to the restaurant with the blue door curtain, revealing more details of the entrance and the surrounding area, including a potted plant and additional seating.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
