  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a high-angle full shot, positioning the brown cartoon mouse, Jerry, with a tan face and large pink ears, in the left foreground as he falls toward the right foreground. Directly behind him, the blue-grey cartoon cat, Tom, with a white muzzle and wide yellow eyes, is falling with an intact light structure, moving from the middle ground to the background. The scene is set within a brightly lit room where the light-colored floor is littered with small, white, feather-like debris. In the middle ground, a white, oval-shaped coffee table holds a bowl of yellow bananas and a dark rectangular object, while a green carpet is on the right side of the frame, sprinkled with the white debris. As both characters descend, the camera smoothly tilts down to track Tom and Jerry, using a shallow depth of field to keep the focus on the two characters. The cartoon cat and mouse fall downwards through the air, with the mouse positioned above the cat. An intact light fixture drops alongside the cat, carrying it downwards. Jerry is depicted in mid-air, initially looking at Tom before closing his eyes as he falls. Below him, Tom is surrounded by the blurry, shattered pieces of a light fixture. The focus then shifts to Jerry, who is shown spinning in the air with his arms and legs spread wide, independently of the cat. The camera transitions to a wide shot as it follows their descent, capturing the chaotic room with the floor visible in the background.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
