  "merged_caption": "The video captures the dynamic movement of vibrant yellow ink in a fluid medium, set against a bright, white background. Initially, two distinct clusters of yellow ink appear, one on the left side and another on the right side of the frame, both in the foreground. As the video progresses, these clusters begin to expand and swirl, gradually merging towards the center. The ink forms intricate, cloud-like patterns with soft, rounded edges, creating a sense of movement and transformation. The yellow hues vary in intensity, adding depth and texture to the evolving shapes. The ink continues to spread and blend, creating a dense, vibrant cloud. By the end of the video, the ink has formed a cohesive, dense mass occupying most of the frame, with the remaining lighter areas providing contrast. The camera remains stationary throughout, capturing the fluid motion and transformation of the ink. The overall spatial dynamics highlight the continuous evolution and merging of the ink, creating a visually striking and fluid composition. The video begins with a blank white background, and the yellow ink appears from the left and right sides, moving towards the center. The two clusters of yellow ink continue to expand and merge as they approach each other. The ink forms a larger, more cohesive mass, with the yellow color becoming more prominent and the shapes more defined. The video concludes with the yellow ink fully merged, forming a large, intricate cloud-like shape against the white background. The overall effect is abstract, with the ink appearing to float and merge, creating a visually striking and fluid composition. The setting is undefined, emphasizing the visual spectacle of the ink's texture and flow.",

    "Scene": "The video presents an abstract scene with a focus on vibrant colors and fluid motion. It begins with a bright, light-filled background that transitions into a dynamic display of swirling yellow ink. The ink forms intricate, cloud-like shapes, creating a sense of movement and transformation. The setting is undefined, emphasizing the visual spectacle of the ink's texture and flow. The overall atmosphere is bright and vivid, with the yellow ink standing out against the lighter backdrop, highlighting the contrast and fluidity of the scene.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
