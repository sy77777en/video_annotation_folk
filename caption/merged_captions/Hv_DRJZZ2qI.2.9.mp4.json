  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot, featuring a man in a black and grey camouflage jacket with blue sleeves and the word \"STRAIT\" in white letters, viewed from behind in the center foreground. He wears a white, red, and yellow helmet and yellow gloves. In the middle ground, another man in a bright yellow and green long-sleeved jersey, matching pants, and a black helmet runs from the left of center toward the foreground. A wooden fence and a white sign that reads \"WORLD TOUR\" are visible in the middle ground on the right, with spectators scattered across the hills in the background under an overcast sky. The scene is set outdoors in a dry, arid landscape characterized by reddish-brown dirt and rolling hills, dotted with sparse green scrub brush. Initially, the man in the blue-sleeved jacket briefly turns to his left to push away a bicycle that rolls toward him after being released by the man in the yellow and green outfit. As the man in yellow moves into the foreground, the two men embrace in the center of the frame, causing the shot to widen to a medium full shot. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, follows the man in the black and blue jacket, moving forward and then arcing slightly counter-clockwise as the two men embrace. The entire shot is characterized by intense, unsteady shaking, maintaining an eye-level, level-angle perspective with a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",

    "Scene": "The scene is set outdoors in a dry, arid landscape characterized by reddish-brown dirt and rolling hills. A wide dirt path winds through the terrain, which is dotted with sparse green scrub brush. In the background, spectators are visible standing on the elevated hillsides under an overcast sky. A simple wooden fence runs alongside the path, near a white sign that reads \"WORLD TOUR\". Two individuals in full-body, colorful racing gear, including helmets, are seen on the path, where they run towards each other and embrace.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
