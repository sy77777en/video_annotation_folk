  "merged_caption": "This video begins with a ground-level wide shot where a beige, paneled door with a silver handle occupies the center-middle ground, set indoors on a light-colored tiled floor. An animated brown mouse with a tan face, large pink ears, and a long tail is seen in mid-air on the right side of the frame, arcing towards the left in the middle ground to shut the door. As the mouse arcs through the air from right to left and shuts the door, the camera moves forward and then tilts upward, shifting to a low angle. This action causes an animated cat's head, characterized by blue-grey fur, yellow eyes, pink inner ears, a white muzzle, and black whiskers, to burst through the wooden door from the opposite side, creating a splintered hole and becoming stuck. The cat has an angry expression, with furrowed brows and bared white teeth. As the door closes, it becomes the background, and the cat's head smashes through the center of the door, coming to a stop as debris flies towards the foreground. The shot freezes on the cat's head, which occupies 30% of the frame's height, with the camera positioned slightly below, looking up at it. Following this, the mouse laughs and escapes, running across the bottom of the screen and disappearing in the lower left corner. To the right of the door, a shelf contains a stack of folded white towels, and the wall on the left side of the door appears to be transparent. The scene is captured with a shallow focus, concentrating on the mid-ground door.",

    "Subject": "This video features two animated characters interacting with a door. A small, brown mouse with a tan face, large pink ears, and a long tail is shown arcing through the air. Simultaneously, the head of a blue-grey cat with yellow eyes, pink inner ears, a white muzzle, and black whiskers smashes through the door, becoming stuck in the resulting hole. The cat has an angry expression, with furrowed brows and bared white teeth.",

    "Scene": "Filmed from a ground-level perspective, the scene is set indoors on a light-colored tiled floor. A beige, paneled door with a silver handle is central to the view. To the right of the door, a shelf contains a stack of folded white towels. A cartoon mouse is shown in mid-air, arcing from right to left and shuts the door, causing a cartoon cat's head to burst through the wood, creating a splintered hole. Additionally, the wall on the left side of the door appears to be transparent.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
