  "merged_caption": "This is an extreme wide shot of a mountain landscape, captured from a very smooth, aerial high-angle perspective. The video is a scenery shot, focusing on the environment rather than any specific subject. From a high-angle perspective, the initial frame looks down on a snow-covered peak, with a rocky cliff formation in the left and center middle ground and a ski slope on the right. A ski lift cable extends from the top right of the frame. The camera, seemingly on a lift, moves backward while rising, looking down to show many skiers below. As the camera pulls backward and simultaneously moves upward, widening the view to reveal the vast mountain range that fills the background, a black gondola car with a logo resembling a crown on its side enters from the top right and moves through the foreground, passing the camera's position. The mountain peak below transitions from a central element to a smaller feature in the center-left of the expansive landscape. Below, several skiers make their way down a wide slope that runs alongside a prominent, reddish-brown rocky cliff formation. A building is visible at the peak, and ski lift towers dot the landscape. In the distance, a vast expanse of snow-covered mountains and forests stretches to the horizon. The camera remains positioned high above the scenery throughout the shot, featuring mild barrel distortion and a varying Dutch angle as it rolls clockwise and then slightly counterclockwise. A deep focus keeps the entire snowy landscape sharp. The video, captured on a bright, sunny day, emphasizes the grandeur of the alpine setting, with the ski lift station sitting atop the peak and the surrounding mountain range stretching into the distant horizon.",

    "Camera": "This fast-motion video, featuring mild barrel distortion, is captured from a very smooth, aerial high-angle perspective. The camera, seemingly on a lift, moves backward while rising, looking down to show many skiers below. The shot has a varying Dutch angle as the camera rolls clockwise and then slightly counterclockwise. A deep focus keeps the entire snowy landscape sharp.",
    "Subject": "This is a mountain landscape scenery shot. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the immense scale and atmosphere of the winter environment rather than any specific person or object. The video, captured from a high, wide-angle perspective, reveals a vast, snow-covered mountain peak under a clear blue sky, with a ski lift cable stretching across the view and a gondola passing by. Below, the steep slope is dotted with reddish-brown rock formations and several small figures of skiers making their way down, while a ski lift station sits atop the peak. As the camera pulls back, it unveils the full expanse of the surrounding mountain range, stretching into the distant horizon and emphasizing the grandeur of the alpine setting.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenic aerial view of a snow-covered mountain on a bright, sunny day. A ski lift and a building are visible at the mountain's peak, with rocky cliffs partially covered in snow. Several skiers are present on the slopes below.",
    "Scene": "From an objective point of view, the camera moves along a cable high above a snow-covered mountain at a ski resort on a clear, sunny day. Below, several skiers make their way down a wide slope that runs alongside a prominent, reddish-brown rocky cliff formation. A building is visible at the peak, and ski lift towers dot the landscape. In the distance, a vast expanse of snow-covered mountains and forests stretches to the horizon. As the camera moves backward while rising, a black gondola car with a logo resembling a crown on its side passes by, moving in the opposite direction.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
