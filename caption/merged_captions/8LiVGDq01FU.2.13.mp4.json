  "merged_caption": "This is a close-up shot focusing on a person in a dark spacesuit with a helmet that has a clear visor, positioned slightly right of center in the foreground. The helmet reflects light, revealing the person's focused and intent face inside. The spacesuit is detailed with various panels and fastenings, suggesting a high-tech design. The person is oriented slightly to the side, with their head turned to the right, indicating attentiveness to something outside the frame. The background, though blurred, contains horizontal bars emitting bright white light, stretching across the middle and upper parts of the frame, possibly part of a larger structure or machinery. The scene takes place in a dimly lit indoor setting, characterized by low-key lighting with high contrast between the illuminated elements and the surrounding darkness. The person remains mostly stationary, with slight movements of the head and body, suggesting a state of alertness or contemplation. The camera is positioned at eye level and at a level angle, focusing on the astronaut in the midground with an extremely shallow depth of field. The background is blurred, emphasizing the subject. The camera remains fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement. The scene remains static throughout the clip, with no changes in framing or subject position.",

    "Camera": "The camera is at eye level and positioned at a level angle, focusing on the astronaut in the midground with an extremely shallow depth of field. The background is blurred, emphasizing the subject. The camera remains fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.",
    "Subject": "The video features a person wearing a dark spacesuit with a helmet that has a clear visor. The helmet reflects light, revealing the person's face inside, which appears focused and intent. The spacesuit is detailed with various panels and fastenings, suggesting a high-tech design. The person is oriented slightly to the side, with their head turned to the right, indicating attentiveness to something outside the frame. The lighting is dim, casting shadows that accentuate the contours of the suit and helmet.",
    "Motion": "The video shows a person in a spacesuit with a helmet, standing in a dimly lit environment with blurred lights in the background. The person remains mostly stationary, with slight movements of the head and body, suggesting a state of alertness or contemplation.",
    "Scene": "The video takes place in a dimly lit indoor setting. A person wearing a white and grey astronaut suit occupies the foreground. The suit features a helmet with a clear, reflective visor and a circular emblem on the chest. The background, though blurred, contains prominent horizontal bars emitting a bright white light, possibly part of a larger structure or machinery. The scene is characterized by low-key lighting with high contrast between the illuminated elements and the surrounding darkness.",
    "Spatial": "This is a close-up shot focusing on a person in a spacesuit. The person is positioned slightly right of center in the foreground. In the background, horizontal bars emitting bright light are visible, stretching across the middle and upper parts of the frame. The scene remains static throughout the clip, with no changes in framing or subject position. The camera is positioned at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
