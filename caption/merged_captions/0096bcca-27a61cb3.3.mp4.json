  "merged_caption": "This video is a wide scenery shot captured from a forward-facing camera position inside a moving vehicle, presenting a cityscape scenery shot from the perspective of a vehicle driving down a multi-lane road at night. Initially, a large semi-truck with a slatted, cage-like trailer is positioned in the right-middle ground, partially framed by dark trees in the right foreground. On the left, a building with a roofline outlined in bright purple and green neon lights occupies the left-middle ground, while the road extends from the bottom of the frame into the center background where red traffic lights are visible. The view through the windshield shows the road ahead, illuminated by streetlights, traffic signals, and the lights of other vehicles. As the camera moves forward in a smooth, forward-moving shot from an eye-level, level-angle perspective, the semi-truck appears larger, dominating the right side of the frame before its trailer begins to exit on the right. Simultaneously, the neon-lit building on the left shifts toward the edge of the frame. A bright lens flare from an overhead streetlight appears in the top-center of the frame as the vehicle approaches the intersection. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire night scene on the road sharp. The scene is dark, illuminated primarily by red traffic lights, the headlights of distant cars, and a bright overhead streetlight that creates a prominent lens flare. The moving point-of-view and wide perspective are used to convey a sense of place rather than to highlight a specific person or object.",

    "Subject": "This video presents a cityscape scenery shot from the perspective of a vehicle driving down a multi-lane road at night. The scene is dark, illuminated primarily by red traffic lights, the headlights of distant cars, and a bright overhead streetlight that creates a prominent lens flare. A large semi-truck with a slatted trailer is stationary at a red light alongside the camera on the right, while on the left, a building is distinguished by its vibrant purple and green neon lighting. There is no main subject because the focus is on capturing the overall atmosphere and environment of an urban night drive; the moving point-of-view and wide perspective are used to convey a sense of place rather than to highlight a specific person or object.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenery shot from the perspective of a car driving down a city street at night. The view through the windshield shows the road ahead, illuminated by streetlights, traffic signals, and the lights of other vehicles. A large truck is visible on the right side of the road as the car moves forward.",
    "Scene": "A forward-facing dashcam view from a vehicle-mounted camera captures the scene ahead as it proceeds down a multi-lane city street at night. The dark, paved road is marked with white lines and illuminated by streetlights and the red glow of traffic signals at an intersection. To the right, a large semi-truck with a slatted, cage-like trailer moves forward. On the left, a building is distinguished by a roofline outlined in bright purple and green neon lights. Dark trees line the side of the road, and the headlights of distant vehicles are visible.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
