  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot relative to the man in the blue shirt holding the knife, who is visible from just below the waist and up. All three men are in the foreground. The man in the blue shirt is half-kneeling right of center, wearing dark shorts and a red baseball cap turned backward. To his left, a second man stands left of center, fully visible, with a beard, wearing a light-colored t-shirt with a dark speckled pattern, dark shorts, and a light-colored hat. A third man stands on the far left, visible from the legs up, wearing a white t-shirt. An orange water balloon is initially seen up and to the left relative to the frame, not directly above the kneeling man. The background consists of tall, green, leafy trees across the frame, with a stack of brown, cut wood left of center. The camera is positioned at hip level, capturing the scene from a low angle with a deep focus, though some trees, like the one at the far right, appear blurry. As the camera exhibits minor, very smooth movement, panning slightly to the right and tilting very slightly down during the initial frames, the man on the far left moves out of the frame. The kneeling man remains stationary as the balloon descends towards his outstretched knife. The video features a speed ramp effect, slowing down significantly as the balloon is about to make contact with the knife. Upon contact, the balloon bursts, causing a large splash of clear water droplets upwards and outwards in the right and center-right of the foreground. The standing man remains positioned left of center, observing the action with his right arm bent and hand near his face. The scene is set outdoors on a sunny day, on a light-colored paved surface, likely a patio.",

    "Camera": "The video features a speed ramp effect, with the change in playback speed most noticeable when the flying water balloon is about to make contact with the knife held by the man in the blue shirt, as the speed slows down significantly at this moment. The camera is positioned at hip level, capturing the scene from a low angle. It maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field, though not all elements are sharp; some trees in the background, such as the one located at the far right of the frame, appear blurry. The camera exhibits minor, very smooth movement, panning slightly to the right over the course of the video and tilting very slightly down during the initial frames.",
    "Subject": "The video initially presents three men. On the far left of the frame, a man in a white t-shirt is partially visible, standing. On his right relative to the frame, another man stands fully visible; he has a beard and wears a light-colored t-shirt with a dark speckled pattern on the front, dark shorts, and a light-colored hat. This second man is looking towards the right of the frame with his right arm bent and hand near his face. The third man, on the right of the frame, is half-kneeling on the ground; he wears a blue t-shirt, dark shorts, and a red baseball cap turned backward. This kneeling man holds a knife with his hands outstretched, and an orange water balloon is falling towards the knife, resulting in a large splash of water when the knife and baloon contact. During this event, the leftmost man is no longer in view.",
    "Motion": "An orange water balloon falls downwards towards a knife held outstretched by a half-kneeling man on the right. As the balloon makes contact with the knife, it bursts, causing water to splash upwards and outwards. A second man, positioned to the left of center in the frame, stands between the other two men and observes this action. The third man, initially on the far left, appears to move out of view due to the camera panning, although he remains stationary. All three men generally remain still throughout the entire sequence.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set outdoors on a sunny day, on a light-colored paved surface, likely a patio. A dense background of tall, green, leafy trees and other foliage creates a natural backdrop. In front of the foliage, a stack of brown, cut wood is visible. An orange water balloon is in mid-air, and then it bursts, sending a spray of clear water droplets upwards and outwards.",
    "Spatial": "The video opens with a medium shot relative to the man in the blue shirt holding the knife, who is visible from just below the waist and up. All three men are in the foreground. The man in the blue shirt is half-kneeling right of center. To his left, a second man stands left of center, and a third man stands on the far left, visible from the legs up. An orange water balloon is initially seen up and to the left relative to the frame, not directly above the kneeling man. The background consists of trees across the frame, with a stack of wood left of center. As the camera shifts slightly to the right, the man on the far left moves out of the frame. The kneeling man remains stationary as the balloon descends and pops on his knife, causing a large water splash upwards and outwards in the right and center-right of the foreground. The standing man remains positioned left of center. The camera is positioned around the hip level of the kneeling man."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
