  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a medium close-up of a middle-aged Caucasian man in a white and grey spacesuit, complete with a helmet featuring a clear visor, positioned in the center-right foreground. His mouth is open, and his eyes are wide, conveying a sense of exertion or distress. The background, brightly lit and out-of-focus, features what appear to be shelves of books surrounding him. The camera is at a level angle, using a shallow depth of field focused on the man in the foreground. It is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement. As the scene progresses, the man briefly closes his eyes, and the background elements begin to shift and arc rapidly around him, while he remains in the center-right foreground. A strong light increasingly envelops the scene. The man then disappears from the frame, and the entire view transitions to a completely plain, off-white screen.",

    "Subject": "The video shows a medium close-up of a middle-aged Caucasian man wearing a white and grey spacesuit, complete with a helmet featuring a clear visor. His mouth is open, and his eyes are wide, conveying a sense of exertion or distress. He briefly closes his eyes before the video cuts to a plain, off-white screen.",
    "Motion": "A man in a spacesuit is seen in a room filled with shelves of books, with his mouth open and eyes wide, indicating exertion or distress. He closes his eyes briefly as the surroundings change rapidly around him. The scene then transitions to a plain, off-white screen.",
    "Scene": "The video shows a medium close-up of an astronaut in a white and grey spacesuit and helmet, with a clear visor revealing their face. The background is a brightly lit, out-of-focus environment filled with shelves of books, possibly an interior space. Then the surroundings change, shifting and arcing rapidly around the astronaut, with a strong light enveloping the scene. Finally, the scene transitions to a completely plain, off-white screen.",
    "Spatial": "The video starts with a medium close-up of a man in a spacesuit, positioned in the center-right foreground. The background, brightly lit and out-of-focus, features what appear to be shelves of books surrounding him. As the scene progresses, these background elements begin to shift and arc rapidly around the man, who remains in the center-right foreground, while a strong light increasingly envelops the scene. The man then disappears from the frame, and the entire view transitions to a plain, off-white screen. The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
