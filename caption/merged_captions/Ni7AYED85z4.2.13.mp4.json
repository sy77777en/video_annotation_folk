  "merged_caption": "This wide shot presents a view looking down a narrow Venetian canal, which occupies the center of the frame, extending from the foreground into the background. A dark metal railing is prominent in the immediate foreground at the bottom of the frame. On the left side, a weathered, multi-story building with faded brownish-pink walls, rectangular windows (some with dark shutters), and a chimney lines the canal, stretching from the foreground into the middle ground and background. On the right side, a long, high reddish-brown brick wall with regularly spaced buttress-like structures runs alongside a paved walkway, similarly extending from the foreground into the background. Several small, light-colored boats are moored along the edges of the canal in the middle ground, on both the left and right sides. In the center background, a small, arched stone bridge is visible at the far end of the canal, with the grey sky occupying the top portion of the frame in the background. The camera is positioned at eye level and initially starts at a level angle, slightly looking upward, then tilts downward to a level angle slightly looking down, exhibiting some unsteadiness and shakiness, with mild barrel distortion. The camera employs deep focus, maintaining a large depth of field. The water in the canal is noticeably moving, as evidenced by the visible up-and-down motion of the boats. In the lower right corner, a person in a red coat walks along the pathway towards the bottom right until they exit the frame, while a white bird flies in the grey sky towards the upper right corner until it leaves the frame. The scene emphasizes the overall environment and atmosphere of this iconic urban waterway, allowing viewers to immerse themselves in the unique architectural and aquatic setting.",

    "Camera": "The video exhibits mild barrel distortion. The camera is positioned at eye level. Initially, the camera angle is level, slightly looking upward, and then it tilts downward to a level angle slightly looking down. The camera employs deep focus, maintaining a large depth of field. The camera tilts down slightly, pauses, and then remains stationary with minimal, smooth shakiness.",
    "Subject": "The video captures a picturesque view down a narrow Venetian canal, framed by weathered, multi-story buildings with shuttered windows on the left side, which appear aged and dirty. The right side of the canal features a small riverside path where a lone pedestrian walks towards the bottom right corner of the frame. A white bird is seen flying out of the frame towards the top right corner. The scene emphasizes the overall environment and atmosphere of this iconic urban waterway, allowing viewers to immerse themselves in the unique architectural and aquatic setting, rather than focusing on specific individuals or objects.",
    "Motion": "The video shows a narrow canal flanked by old buildings on both sides, with several boats docked along the water. A person in a red jacket is seen walking along the right side of the canal, moving towards the bottom right corner of the frame until they exit the frame. A bird is flying in the sky above the canal, moving from the center towards the top right of the frame. The water in the canal is noticeably moving, as evidenced by the visible up-and-down motion of the boats, and the buildings appear to be weathered, with some showing signs of wear and tear.",
    "Scene": "The video shows a view down a narrow canal in Venice, Italy, on an overcast day. The water in the canal is a murky green, with several small, light-colored boats moored along its edges. On the left, an old, weathered multi-story building with faded brownish-pink walls, rectangular windows (some with dark shutters), and a chimney lines the canal. On the right, a long, high reddish-brown brick wall with regularly spaced buttress-like structures runs alongside a paved walkway. A dark metal railing, part of the bridge from which the video is filmed, is visible in the foreground. Further down the canal, a small, arched stone bridge can be seen. A lone bird flies in the grey sky, and a person in a pink jacket walks along the pathway on the right.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
