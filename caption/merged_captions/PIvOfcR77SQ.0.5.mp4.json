  "merged_caption": "The video is a scenery shot, capturing the interior of a yurt without a specific main subject, presented as a wide shot. Initially, a blue chest of drawers is positioned in the center-left middle ground, a grey armchair in the center-right middle ground, a wooden cabinet on the right middle ground, and a kitchenette area on the left middle ground, with a light grey rug in the center foreground. The camera, shot with mild barrel distortion from an eye-level perspective, maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field and smoothly pans left. During this pan, the armchair and cabinet exit the frame to the right, while the blue chest of drawers shifts to the right background. The kitchenette, now showing two stools and a mini-fridge, moves from the left to the center-right background. A double bed with patterned bedding featuring red, white, and grey Christmas-themed gnomes enters from the left, becoming prominent in the center and then center-right middle ground, accompanied by a small table at its foot and two wooden roof support poles visible on either side of the foot of the bed. A coffee maker and a fruit bowl are placed on the countertop. The camera further pans left, showing a gray sofa with a black bag on it and a small wooden table with a jar and a small figurine. Finally, a grey sofa enters from the left, occupying the left middle ground. Throughout the pan, the yurt's wooden lattice walls and radial roof beams extend from the foreground to the background. Towards the end, a portion of a hand briefly appears in the bottom left foreground. Various small decorative items, including Christmas gnomes, are placed around the room.",

    "Camera": "The video, shot with mild barrel distortion, is filmed from an eye-level perspective. It maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera smoothly pans left, showing the interior of a yurt.",
    "Subject": "The video presents an interior scenery shot, showcasing the inside of a yurt. The camera pans around, revealing a furnished space with a bed covered in a patterned duvet, a small kitchenette area with a counter and stools, a blue chest of drawers, a grey armchair, and a grey sofa. The yurt's structure, with its wooden lattice walls and radial roof beams, is visible throughout. There is no main subject as the focus is on capturing the overall environment, atmosphere, and layout of the yurt's interior rather than a specific object or person. Towards the end of the video, a portion of a hand briefly appears in the bottom left corner of the frame.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a view of a room featuring a wooden door, a blue armchair with a fur throw, a blue dresser, and some scattered items on the floor.

    "Scene": "The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, panning across the interior of a furnished yurt. The circular structure features exposed wooden lattice walls and a conical roof with wooden beams lined with white fabric, supported by two wooden poles positioned on either side of the foot of the double bed. The space is carpeted in dark grey with a light grey rug in the center. Furniture includes a double bed with patterned bedding featuring red, white, and grey Christmas-themed gnomes, and grey towels. A blue wooden three-drawer dresser, a blue fabric armchair with a brown furry throw, and a dark grey sofa are also present. As the camera continues panning left, it reveals a wooden counter accompanied by a mini-fridge and two light-colored wooden stools. A tall, light-colored wooden cabinet is also visible. White electric heaters are mounted on the walls, and various small decorative items, including Christmas gnomes, are placed around the room.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
