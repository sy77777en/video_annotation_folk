  "merged_caption": "The video initially features a close-up shot of a textured, weathered wooden branch positioned diagonally across the frame, extending from the top left to the bottom right, set against a rocky, sunlit background suggesting an outdoor setting. The branch is light brown with visible grains and small patches of dust or sand, indicating a natural, possibly arid location with muted earth tones. The lighting suggests a bright, sunlit day, casting clear shadows and highlighting the textures of both the branch and the insect. A long-legged insect with a distinctive black and orange body enters from the top left of the frame, moving steadily across the branch towards the right. The insect's movement is captured from a high angle, with the camera positioned above the subject. It crawls smoothly and uninterruptedly, maintaining a steady pace as it traverses the surface. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement, and features an extremely shallow depth of field that causes the background to blur significantly, emphasizing the natural details in the foreground. As the insect progresses further, it eventually reaches the right side of the frame and starts to exit the view, leaving the piece of wood in focus once more. The scene remains focused on the interaction between the branch and the insect, with the background softly blurred, highlighting the natural details in the foreground. The camera exhibits noticeable shaking throughout, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise serene setting.",

    "Camera": "The video is shot from a high angle, focusing on a piece of wood in the foreground with an insect crawling across it, set against an extremely shallow depth of field that causes the background to blur significantly. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.",
    "Subject": "The video shows a close-up of a textured piece of wood as an insect with a distinctive black and orange body enters from the top left corner and moves steadily across, eventually exiting the frame on the right side.",
    "Motion": "A close-up view reveals a piece of wood with a rough, textured surface. From the left side of the frame, a long-legged insect with a black body and orange markings emerges and begins its journey across the wood. It crawls steadily to the right, maintaining a smooth and uninterrupted pace. As the insect progresses further, it eventually reaches the right side of the frame and starts to exit the view, leaving the piece of wood in focus once more.",
    "Scene": "The video captures an outdoor setting featuring a close-up view of a textured, weathered branch elevated above a sandy or gravelly surface. The branch is light brown with visible grains and small patches of dust or sand. The environment suggests a natural, possibly arid location with muted earth tones. A notable visual element is an insect with long, slender legs and a body marked by contrasting black and orange colors, moving across the branch. The lighting indicates a bright, sunlit day, casting clear shadows and highlighting the textures of both the branch and the insect. The scene remains focused on the interaction between the branch and the insect, with the background softly blurred, emphasizing the natural details in the foreground.",
    "Spatial": "The video initially features a close-up shot of the wooden branch positioned diagonally across the frame, extending from the top left to the bottom right. The branch is in the foreground, with a rocky, sunlit background suggesting an outdoor setting. Then, a long-legged insect with a black body and orange markings enters from the top left of the frame, moving across the branch towards the right. The insect's movement is captured from a high angle, with the camera positioned above the subject. It traverses the surface, and exits the frame on the right side.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
