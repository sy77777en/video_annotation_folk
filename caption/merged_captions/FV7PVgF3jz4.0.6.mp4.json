  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a man with curly, dark brown hair and a beard, wearing a black turtleneck sweater, sitting in profile at a desk in a director's chair in the middle ground, positioned in the center of the frame. He is actively typing on a vintage black typewriter at a dark desk on the right. A plant with large, dark green leaves is draped over the chair on the left, and a dark-colored purse with a metallic clasp hangs on the wall in the center-top-left background, which is striped with strong, horizontal shadows from window blinds. Papers are scattered on the floor around the desk and fill a nearby wastebasket. The scene is dimly lit, illuminated by cool blue light with warmer, yellowish tones on the wall. As the camera maintains a steady, eye-level position with a level angle, it smoothly trucks from right to left, using deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. This movement gradually reframes the shot into a medium shot, bringing a vintage rotary phone into the foreground, occupying both the left and center foreground, partially obscuring the view of the man, who is now positioned on the right side of the frame. In the latter part of the video, the man stops typing and rests his elbows on the desk, using both hands to cup his head. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the video, capturing the entire scene with clarity.",

    "Subject": "A man with curly, dark brown hair and a beard sits in profile at a desk, focused on his work. He is wearing a black turtleneck sweater and is actively typing on a vintage black typewriter. He is seated in a wooden director's chair with a white canvas back. In the background, a dark-colored purse with a metallic clasp hangs on the wall, which is striped with shadows from window blinds. Papers are scattered on the floor around his desk. In the foreground, the top of a vintage rotary phone is partially visible.",
    "Motion": "A man sits in profile at a desk, his fingers actively pressing the keys of a vintage typewriter. As he types, the camera slowly trucks from right to left, gradually bringing a vintage rotary phone into the foreground.

    "Scene": "In a dimly lit room, a man sits in a director's chair at a dark desk, using a vintage black typewriter. The wall behind him is cast with strong, horizontal shadows, creating a striped pattern of light and dark. A black bag hangs on the wall, and a plant with large, dark green leaves is draped over the back of the wooden-framed chair. Papers are scattered on the floor around the desk and fill a nearby wastebasket. In the foreground, a vintage telephone is partially visible. The scene is illuminated by cool blue light, with warmer, yellowish tones on the wall.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a full shot of a man sitting in a director's chair in the middle ground, positioned in the center of the frame. He is at a desk on the right, using a typewriter. A plant is draped over the chair on the left, and a purse hangs on the wall in the center-top-left background. As the shot moves leftward, it reframes into a medium shot. In this final composition, the man is positioned on the right side of the frame, while a vintage rotary phone enters the shot, occupying both the left and center foreground, partially obscuring the view of the man. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the video."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
