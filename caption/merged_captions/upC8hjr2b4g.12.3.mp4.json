  "merged_caption": "In a close-up shot, a faceless male figure is framed from the shoulders up, occupying the right foreground of the scene against a dark, indistinct background. The figure has smooth, skin-toned, and featureless skin, lacking any eyes, nose, or mouth. It wears black, round-rimmed glasses and has short, dark, neatly styled hair, dressed in a white collared shirt. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, using an extremely shallow depth of field to keep the figure's glasses in focus. The camera moves slowly and slightly unsteadily forward with some minor shaking, while the faceless male figure remains completely motionless throughout the close-up shot. The setting is dimly lit with a dark green, indistinct background, characterized by focused lighting that highlights the subject while the surroundings remain in shadow. An overlay of white subtitles is positioned at the bottom left of the screen, changing from \"[2]\" to \"[27]\".",

    "Scene": "In a dimly lit setting with a dark green, indistinct background, a faceless figure is shown in a close-up shot. The figure has dark, styled hair, wears thin, round-rimmed glasses, and is dressed in a white collared shirt. Their face is a smooth, featureless surface with a warm skin tone. The scene is characterized by focused lighting that highlights the subject while the surroundings remain in shadow. An overlay of white subtitles is positioned at the bottom left of the screen, changing from \"[2]\" to \"[27]\".",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
