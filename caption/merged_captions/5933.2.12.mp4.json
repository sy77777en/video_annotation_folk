  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot, where the left side of the frame is largely obscured by a dark foreground element resembling a metal chain-link fence or gate. In the middle ground, slightly right of center, a section of dark wooden paneling is visible, illuminated by light casting lattice-like shadows. The camera is at a level angle, using shallow focus with the background remaining in focus. As the camera moves in a clockwise arc, more of the room becomes visible, revealing intricate wooden paneling and carvings on the wall. The camera continues its arc, showing a detailed wooden structure with an arched opening and additional carvings. As the view arcs clockwise, more of this middle-ground wall is revealed. A large, intricately carved wooden crest, featuring lions rampant on both sides and a central shield with the motto \"DIEU ET MON DROIT\" carved below it, becomes more prominent in the center-right of the frame, remaining in the middle ground. The dark foreground element continues to occupy the left portion of the frame throughout the arc. The camera appears to be positioned at roughly the height of the crest. The overall lighting is low, casting deep shadows and highlighting the texture and details of the woodwork. The scene is set in a dimly lit interior, suggesting it takes place late at night. Dark wooden paneling covers the walls, featuring rectangular sections and a more ornate, carved wooden element partially visible. A faint, cool-toned light streams through a barred window, illuminating the left side of the frame and casting a grid-like shadow on the wall.",

    "Camera": "The camera is at a level angle, using shallow focus with the background remaining in focus. It arcs smoothly clockwise.",
    "Subject": "The video shows a dimly lit room featuring elaborate, dark wooden paneling. As the camera moves in an arc clockwise motion, a large, intricately carved wooden crest becomes visible on the wall. The crest prominently displays lions rampant on both sides and a shield in the center, with the motto \"DIEU ET MON DROIT\" carved below it. The overall lighting is low, casting deep shadows and highlighting the texture and details of the woodwork.",
    "Motion": "The camera starts by showing a dark room with a wooden door and a window with a grid pattern. As the camera moves in a clockwise arc, more of the room becomes visible, revealing intricate wooden paneling and carvings on the wall. The camera continues its arc, showing a detailed wooden structure with an arched opening and additional carvings. As the camera moves further, a large, ornate wooden carving with a central emblem and flanking figures comes into view.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set in a dimly lit interior, suggesting it takes place late at night. Dark wooden paneling covers the walls, featuring rectangular sections and a more ornate, carved wooden element partially visible. This carving includes a central emblem or shield with a lion on each side, rendered in dark wood. A faint, cool-toned light streams through a barred window, illuminating the left side of the frame and casting a grid-like shadow on the wall. In the foreground, a metal chain-link fence or gate partially obscures the view, adding to the mysterious ambiance.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
