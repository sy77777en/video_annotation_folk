  "merged_caption": "The video starts with an extreme close-up of a cartoon boy's face, centered in the foreground. He has light skin, reddish freckles across his nose and cheeks, large dark eyes, and short, dark brown hair. A green vine with small, dark green, clover-like leaves is visible hanging from his nostrils over his slightly open mouth. The boy tries to shake off the green branch by moving his head. From a level angle, the camera smoothly and quickly moves backward while slightly panning right to follow the worried child. As the camera pulls back to a medium shot, the boy remains centered in the frame, now flanked by two other children on the left and right sides in the middle ground. The scene is set in a brightly lit classroom, and as the camera moves, a bulletin board and a globe become visible in the background. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the child in sharp focus throughout the shot.",

    "Subject": "A cartoon boy with light skin, reddish freckles across his nose and cheeks, and short, dark brown hair is shown in a close-up. His large, black eyes are wide, and his mouth is slightly agape. A green, curly vine with small, dark green, clover-like leaves hangs out of both of his nostrils, extending down past his mouth. At the end, two of his classmates appear on either side of him.",
    "Motion": "The cartoon boy tries to shake off the green branch hanging from his nose by moving his head.",
    "Scene": "In a brightly lit classroom, the scene presents a close-up of a cartoon boy's face. He has light skin with reddish freckles across his nose and cheeks, large dark eyes, and dark hair. A green, leafy vine emerges from his nostrils, curling down in front of his slightly open mouth. The vine is smooth and features small, three-lobed leaves. As the camera moves backward, other students become visible in the middleground, and a bulletin board and a globe can be seen in the background.",
    "Spatial": "The video starts with an extreme close-up of a cartoon boy's face, centered in the foreground. A green vine is visible hanging from his nostrils over his mouth. The camera then pulls back to a medium shot, revealing the boy still centered in the frame, now flanked by two other children on the left and right sides in the middle ground. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
