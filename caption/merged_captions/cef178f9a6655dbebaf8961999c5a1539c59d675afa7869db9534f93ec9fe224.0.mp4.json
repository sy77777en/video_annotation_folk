  "merged_caption": "This wide scenery shot is captured from a static, level-angle perspective in the middle of a bustling London street, focusing on the urban environment rather than a specific subject. The dark asphalt road fills the bottom of the frame, creating leading lines that draw the eye toward the background. Tall, classical stone buildings line the left and right sides, framing the scene and converging toward a distant multi-level domed building with an arched entrance positioned in the center background. The upper portion of the frame shows a bright blue sky with a few wisps of clouds, and a Union Jack flag flying from a building in the top right. The camera remains stationary, using a deep focus to keep the entire street scene, from the road in the immediate foreground to the buildings in the distance, sharp. Throughout the shot, various vehicles, including cars, a black cab, a red double-decker bus, and vans, continuously enter from the bottom left and right, travel through the middle ground, and recede into the distance toward the center of the frame. The steady stream of traffic moves away from the camera, emphasizing the dynamic atmosphere of city life. The level-angle perspective highlights the height of the buildings and the expanse of the street, immersing the viewer in the scene. The shot is designed to convey a sense of place rather than to follow a specific object or person, capturing the grand scale of the urban environment under the bright sky.",

    "Camera": "This is a fixed, slightly unsteady shot from a ground-level, level-angle perspective. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the entire street scene, from the road in the immediate foreground to the buildings in the distance, sharp.",
    "Subject": "This video captures a cityscape scene from a ground-level perspective, looking down a wide, paved street flanked by grand, multi-story buildings with classical architectural details. Under a bright blue sky, a Union Jack flag flies from a building on the right, and a multi-level domed building with an arched entrance is visible in the distance. A steady stream of traffic, including black cabs, a red double-decker bus, and other cars, moves away from the camera. There is no main subject, as the focus is on capturing the grand scale of the urban environment and the dynamic atmosphere of city life. The level-angle perspective emphasizes the height of the buildings and the expanse of the street, immersing the viewer in the scene. The shot is designed to convey a sense of place rather than to follow a specific object or person.",
    "Motion": "This video captures a level-angle, ground-level view of a bustling street in what appears to be London, England. The camera remains stationary as various vehicles, including cars, a black cab, a red double-decker bus, and a tour bus, drive past. The street is framed on both sides by tall, elegant, historic buildings under a bright blue sky, with a Union Jack flag flying from one of the buildings on the right.",
    "Scene": "From a level-angle perspective in the middle of a wide London street, traffic flows away from the camera during the daytime. The road is lined on both sides by tall, classical stone buildings that rise against a bright blue sky with a few wisps of clouds. A Union Jack flag is visible flying from a flagpole on one of the buildings on the right. A variety of vehicles, including iconic red double-decker buses, black taxis, vans, and passenger cars, travel down the dark asphalt road toward a distant multi-level domed building with an arched entrance.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
