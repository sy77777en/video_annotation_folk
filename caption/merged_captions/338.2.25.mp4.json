  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot, capturing the main subject, a man with short dark hair in a beige short-sleeved shirt, seated at a table in a restaurant, positioned in the center-left of the frame. He is engaged in an unusual action, using a blue portable electric fan attached to chopsticks to cool his noodles while eating. In the lower right corner of the foreground, a blurred blue object, likely part of a person's clothing, is visible. As the camera, positioned at eye level with a level angle, smoothly moves forward toward the man, the focus shifts from the middle ground to the foreground while panning right to keep him centered. The man next to him, wearing a yellow shirt and glasses, watches with a shocked expression, situated in the middle ground. Both men are seated at a table in a busy dining area with decorative wall art, creating a warm, inviting atmosphere. The shot transitions to a medium close-up, focusing more closely on the upper bodies and faces of the two men. The main subject remains in the center-left, actively using the fan attached to chopsticks, while the second man stays to the right, observing. In the background, other diners are seated at tables, scattered throughout the scene, with some visible on the left and right sides. The intricate wall art and decorative elements are consistently visible, framing the scene. The lighting is soft, creating a cozy ambiance, and the carpeted floor complements the overall decor, enhancing the restaurant's traditional style. The camera maintains a level height relative to the subjects throughout, keeping their actions and expressions clearly in view, capturing a lively yet relaxed dining experience.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
