  "merged_caption": "A close-up, low-angle shot centers on an ostrich's head and neck in the foreground, set against a background of blurred green foliage and a bright sky. The ostrich, with large, dark, round eyes and long, prominent eyelashes, has a flat, dark-colored beak and is covered in short, fuzzy, light brown feathers. Initially, the ostrich looks directly at the camera from a low, eye-level perspective, appearing to look straight ahead. The camera captures this with an extremely shallow depth of field, keeping the ostrich in sharp focus while blurring the background foliage. The camera remains fixed but exhibits a slight unsteadiness. The ostrich blinks its eyes and then slowly turns its head to its right, shifting its gaze to the side and showing its profile against the blurry background. A white text overlay with the word \"OSTRICH\" in capital letters appears in the bottom-left corner.",

    "Scene": "A close-up, low-angle shot captures an ostrich's head and long neck against a soft-focus outdoor background. The environment features blurred green foliage under a bright, pale sky.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
