  "merged_caption": "This full shot, filmed from a high angle, shows a blue and yellow number 2 Chevrolet Camaro race car positioned diagonally in the middle ground. The car's rear is in the middle left, and its front is in the lower right, straddling the asphalt track on the left and a grassy incline on the right. The rear half of the car is yellow with \"GimmeCountry.com\" in large white letters, while the front half is blue with a \"Gimme Country\" logo on the hood. A large white racing number \"2\" is on the side door, accompanied by sponsors like \"Pinnacle\" and \"ALSCO.\" The race car remains stationary throughout the video, with white smoke continuously billowing from its hood in the lower right. Initially, the back right wheel appears to be spinning before it stops abruptly. Later in the video, the wheel briefly spins again, causing the car to move forward slightly. A white vehicle, likely a safety car with its lightbar activated, enters the frame from the bottom left foreground, travels past the race car, and exits at the bottom left. The shadow of the white vehicle is briefly visible in the upper left of the screen before it comes into view. The camera captures the scene from a high, overhead angle at approximately a second-floor height, using a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. While the camera remains mostly static, it exhibits slight, unsteady shaking and occasionally pans to the right to follow the race car's intermittent movements. The surface appears dry except for what seems to be oil around the stationary car. Two solid yellow lines mark the boundary of the track.",

    "Camera": "From a high, overhead angle at approximately a second-floor height, the camera captures the smoking race car. The shot uses a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.

    "Subject": "A blue and yellow number 2 Chevrolet Camaro race car is stopped on a wet surface, positioned partially on an asphalt track with two yellow lines and partially on a grassy incline. The rear half of the car is yellow with \"GimmeCountry.com\" in large white letters, while the front half is blue with a \"Gimme Country\" logo on the hood. A large white racing number \"2\" is on the side door, accompanied by sponsors like \"Pinnacle\" and \"ALSCO.\" White smoke continuously billows from the hood of the car, obscuring parts of it. A white vehicle, likely a safety car with its lightbar activated, briefly appears on the left side of the scene as it drives past.",
    "Motion": "The blue and yellow race car remains stationary on a wet track as white smoke continuously billows from its hood. Initially, the back right wheel appears to be spinning before it stops abruptly. Later in the video, the wheel briefly spins again, causing the car to move forward slightly. A white safety car with its lights on drives past on the left side of the frame.",
    "Scene": "From a high-angle perspective, a black and yellow race car with the number 2 is stopped on a racetrack. The car is positioned at the edge of the dark asphalt, next to a sloped green grass area, with its front end angled towards the grass. Two solid yellow lines mark the boundary of the track, and the surface appears dry except for what seems to be oil around the stationary car. White steam billows from the front of the car, and the back right tire occasionally spins. A white vehicle briefly drives past in the foreground.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
