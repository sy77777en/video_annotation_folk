  "merged_caption": "The video begins with an extreme wide shot, capturing three people slightly to the right of center on the crest of a large red sand dune in Wadi Rum, Jordan. A massive rock formation dominates the middle ground on the right, with more mountains receding into the hazy background on the left. The three people, two men in the center and a third person to the right, stand stationary, initially appearing to converse as they look out at the vast desert landscape. The man on the left wears a blue short-sleeved shirt and yellow shorts, while the man next to him wears a dark green long-sleeved shirt and red shorts; both stand with their hands on their hips. The third person, slightly lower on the dune, is dressed in dark pants and a dark long-sleeved top, with a light-colored head covering and a backpack. The camera, positioned above the subjects, arcs counterclockwise from left to right while simultaneously moving closer to them, transitioning the scene into a wide shot. This movement causes the camera angle to shift from a level view to a high angle, striving to align the subjects along the central axis of the frame. As the camera smoothly orbits them, the individuals turn to look at the camera while remaining in their fixed positions. By the end of the shot, the subjects are centrally framed on the dune, with the camera's arcing motion revealing a vast desert valley and mountain range that now fills the background. The drone's perspective utilizes a deep focus, keeping both the people and the expansive, rolling dunes of reddish-orange sand, set against a backdrop of massive, weathered sandstone mountains, sharp. The ground is sparsely dotted with small, dry shrubs, and the sky above is pale blue with light clouds.",

    "Camera": "From a drone's perspective, the camera smoothly arcs counterclockwise around a group of three people on a sand dune while simultaneously moving forward to approach them. This movement causes the camera angle to shift from a level view to a high angle. The shot utilizes a deep focus, keeping both the people and the vast desert landscape sharp.",
    "Subject": "Three people with light skin stand together on the crest of a red sand dune. Two men are positioned in the center. The man on the left wears a blue short-sleeved shirt and yellow shorts, while the man next to him wears a dark green long-sleeved shirt and red shorts; both stand with their hands on their hips. To the right of the two men and slightly lower on the dune is a third person, dressed in dark pants and a dark long-sleeved top, with a light-colored head covering and a backpack.",

    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone circles around a vast desert landscape in Wadi Rum, Jordan. The scene features expansive, rolling dunes of reddish-orange sand set against a backdrop of massive, weathered sandstone mountains. Three people stand atop the sharp crest of a high dune, their long shadows stretching across the sand. The drone's movement reveals a wide valley with more mountains receding into a hazy, sunlit atmosphere. The ground is sparsely dotted with small, dry shrubs, and the sky above is pale blue with light clouds.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
