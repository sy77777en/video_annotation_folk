  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a wide, high-angle shot, showing a square wooden kitchen platform in the center middle ground. Two small, cartoonish chef characters, one in a blue uniform and the other in a red uniform, both wearing light blue chef hats, are positioned near the center of this platform. Overlays of recipe cards are fixed in the top left corner, a score and tip multiplier are in the bottom left, and a timer is in the bottom right. The setting is a square wooden kitchen platform suspended high in a cloudy, grey sky, outfitted with counters, a sink, and various food preparation stations. The platform is held by thick ropes attached to a large, pink, burning hot air balloon above, with small fires burning at its corners. The camera tilts downward, tracking the descent of the platform, which is suspended from the large, red, pumpkin-shaped balloon that now occupies the center of the frame. The entire assembly, including the platform and balloon, descends through the cloudy sky, with debris appearing floating in the middle ground. The camera moves rapidly downward, following the balloon's descent, with noticeable shaking throughout. The balloon and platform continue to fall, eventually disappearing below the bottom of the frame into the grey clouds that fill the background, leaving only the static UI overlays visible. The deep focus of the camera keeps all elements of the scene sharp, maintaining clarity as the scene transitions from the kitchen platform downward, revealing the large, pink, deflating balloon that is on fire, surrounded by floating debris against the overcast sky, before the scene is obscured by clouds.",

    "Subject": "The video displays a gameplay scene featuring two small, cartoonish chef characters. One chef wears a blue uniform, while the other wears a red uniform. Both chefs are wearing light blue chef hats. They are on a square wooden kitchen platform that is suspended by ropes. The platform is attached to a large, red, pumpkin-shaped hot air balloon with small fires burning on its surface. The entire assembly is shown falling through a grey, cloudy sky before disappearing into the clouds below.",
    "Motion": "The view transitions from the kitchen platform downward, revealing it is attached to a large, red hot air balloon. The entire assembly descends through a cloudy sky, eventually disappearing into the clouds.",
    "Scene": "In a third-person 3D game video where the entire character is visible on screen, the setting is a square wooden kitchen platform suspended high in a cloudy, grey sky. The platform, which has small fires burning at its corners, is held by thick ropes attached to a large balloon structure above. The kitchen is outfitted with counters, a sink, and various food preparation stations. Suddenly, the balloon and platform begin to fall, revealing the large, pink, deflating balloon that is on fire, surrounded by floating debris against the overcast sky, before the scene is obscured by clouds. Several overlays are present: recipe cards are in the top left corner, a score and tip multiplier are in the bottom left, and a countdown timer is in the bottom right.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
