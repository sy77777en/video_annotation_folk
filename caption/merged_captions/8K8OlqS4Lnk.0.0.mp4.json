  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide shot of an outdoor scene, featuring a handheld camera at eye level. Initially, a bright primary rainbow arcs from the bottom right to the top left of the frame, with a fainter secondary rainbow visible above it against a grey, overcast sky in the background. The tops of lush green trees occupy the bottom foreground, and two horizontal power lines stretch across the middle ground. The camera begins with a low angle, capturing the rainbow, and then pans left, tilting upward initially and then downward, revealing more of the rainbow and the surrounding environment. As the camera continues to move, it maintains deep focus with a large depth of field, despite some slight shaking. This movement reveals a paved road in the foreground, a white fence, and more trees in the middle ground, with buildings and a tall palm tree visible in the background on the left. The overall lighting suggests daytime, likely following a rain shower. In the final composition, the rainbow is visible in the center and top right of the frame, with its right end appearing to touch down behind the tall palm tree located in the middle ground on the right side of the frame. The presence of power lines and a distant mountain adds to the sense of scale and depth, enhancing the overall ambiance without highlighting a main subject. The camera's slightly elevated, eye-level perspective captures the serene environment, emphasizing the rainbow's colors and the natural beauty of the scene.",

    "Camera": "The video features a handheld camera at eye level, initially capturing a rainbow from a low angle and then shifting to a level angle. The camera pans left to reveal the full extent of the rainbow, tilting up initially and then down. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking. The camera maintains deep focus with a large depth of field throughout.",
    "Subject": "The video is a landscape scenery shot. It captures a vibrant rainbow arcing across a cloudy sky, with lush green trees and a street scene below. The focus is on the natural beauty and atmospheric conditions, emphasizing the rainbow's colors and the serene environment rather than any specific object. The presence of power lines and a distant mountain adds to the sense of scale and depth, enhancing the overall ambiance without highlighting a main subject.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a view of a double rainbow in the sky, with the camera panning from right to left. The rainbow is clearly visible against a backdrop of trees and power lines. As the camera continues to move, more of the rainbow and the surrounding environment come into view, including additional trees and power lines. The camera then reveals a street scene with houses and a fence, while the rainbow remains prominent in the sky.",
    "Scene": "The video shows an outdoor scene dominated by a bright double rainbow arching across a grey, overcast sky. Below the rainbow, lush green treetops are visible, along with several horizontal power lines stretching across the view. As the video progresses, the view pans slightly, revealing more of the ground level, including a paved road running alongside a white fence. Behind the fence and trees, buildings and a tall palm tree can be seen in the background. The overall lighting suggests daytime, likely following a rain shower.",
    "Spatial": "This video presents a wide shot of an outdoor scene. Initially, a bright primary rainbow arcs from the bottom right to the top left of the frame, with a fainter secondary rainbow visible above it against a grey sky in the background. The tops of green trees occupy the bottom foreground, and two horizontal power lines stretch across the middle ground. The camera consistently pans left, first tilting upward and then downward. This movement reveals a paved road in the foreground, a white fence and more trees in the middle ground, and buildings in the background on the left. In the final composition, the rainbow is visible in the center and top right of the frame, with its right end appearing to touch down behind a tall palm tree located in the middle ground on the right side of the frame. The camera is positioned at a slightly elevated, eye-level perspective."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
