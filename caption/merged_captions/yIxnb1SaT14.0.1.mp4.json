  "merged_caption": "This video showcases an extreme wide shot of a cityscape at night, with the illuminated Eiffel Tower positioned in the background. The Seine River flows from the right side of the foreground to the left side of the background, its surface reflecting the city lights. The middle ground prominently features the distant riverbanks of the Seine and boats docked along the shore. In the bottom left foreground, light trails from moving traffic are visible on a road. The dark, cloudy sky fills the upper half of the frame. Movement within the shot includes a rotating beacon at the tower's apex and the shimmering reflections on the water. The camera is positioned at an elevated height, looking across the river. A watermark is located in the bottom right corner. This captivating long-exposure or timelapse shot of the Eiffel Tower in Paris at night showcases dynamic elements throughout the scene. The bright red and white light trails of traffic moving along the road on the left create a striking visual effect. In the sky, clouds drift by, adding to the sense of motion, while a rotating light device at the top of the Eiffel Tower emits blue beams. On the Seine River, boats move swiftly, their lights reflecting vibrantly on the water. This is a smooth, overhead-level time-lapse of the Eiffel Tower at night, captured from a low angle. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire cityscape sharp as it trucks steadily to the right. The video presents a breathtaking cityscape scenery shot of Paris at night, centered on the iconic Eiffel Tower. The tower, illuminated in a brilliant golden-yellow light, stands majestically against the dark, cloudy sky, with a bright blue-white spotlight rotating from its apex.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
