  "merged_caption": "This close-up shot features two women positioned in the foreground of a brightly lit, modern kitchen during the day. The first woman, occupying the left portion of the frame, has long, dark, straight hair and wears a white and black checkered, collared shirt. She has a silver-colored ring shaped like a treble clef on her right index finger and a thin yellow bracelet on her left wrist. She is smiling and looking towards the right while eating a slice of pizza held in her right hand and finishes eating something from her left hand. The second woman, positioned on the right side slightly in front of the first, has long, dark hair and is dressed in a black and white striped shirt. She wears a small, silver-colored ring on her right thumb and is smiling while looking back at the first woman, holding a small piece of food in her right hand. In the out-of-focus background, white cabinets and a tiled backsplash are visible, illuminated by warm under-cabinet lighting. The camera, filmed from a low, eye-level angle, focuses on the two women in the foreground, utilizing a shallow depth of field to blur the kitchen background. It executes a very smooth, minor pan from left to right, maintaining its position at the subjects' level throughout the clip.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
