  "merged_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of a woman who is centrally positioned in the frame and occupies the foreground. Initially, she appears as a black silhouette against a deep purple backdrop. As the light turns on, she is revealed to have a medium skin tone, wearing a bright pink dress with prominent, ruffled short sleeves and a blue turban that covers most of her dark hair, with some visible at the front. She has dark eye makeup, red lipstick, and large gold hoop earrings. Her arms are extended outwards to her sides, palms facing down, with her fingers slightly spread, and her head is slightly tilted. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle. It is fixed but slightly unsteady, showing no intentional movement. The focus of the video is clearly on the woman in the foreground. Behind her, in the center of the background, a distinct pink-purple circular spotlight adds to the theatrical and moody atmosphere, with the strong, singular color dominating the visual field. The framing remains static throughout the clip, with no changes in shot size or the subject's position. The woman subtly turns her head and makes slight movements with her body, enhancing the dynamic quality of the scene.",

    "Subject": "The video begins with a woman as a black silhouette. As the light turns on, she is revealed to have a medium skin tone, standing facing forward. She wears a bright pink dress with prominent, ruffled short sleeves and a blue turban that covers most of her dark hair, with some visible at the front. She has dark eye makeup, red lipstick, and large gold hoop earrings. Her arms are extended out to her sides, palms facing down, with her fingers slightly spread, and her head is slightly tilted.",
    "Motion": "The woman stands with her arms extended out to her sides, palms facing down, subtly turning her head and making slight movements with her body.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set indoors, likely on a stage, where a figure initially appears as a black silhouette against a deep purple backdrop. As the light intensifies, the details of a woman in pink clothing become visible, creating a striking contrast. Behind her, in the center of the background, a distinct pink-purple circular spotlight adds to the theatrical and moody atmosphere, with the strong, singular color dominating the visual field.",
    "Spatial": "The video presents a medium shot of a woman who is centrally positioned in the frame and occupies the foreground. Her arms are extended outwards to her sides. In the background, a circular purple spotlight is centered behind her, set against a backdrop that fills the entire frame. The framing remains static throughout the clip, with no changes in shot size or the subject's position. The camera is at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
