  "merged_caption": "This close-up shot centers on a man with light skin, short dark curly hair, and a short dark beard and mustache, who occupies the foreground of the frame. He is wearing a dark green or black hoodie and looks directly towards the camera with dark eyes. A small mark or scar is visible on his right cheek. His mouth is slightly parted, and he maintains a neutral expression throughout the brief clip. The background is predominantly dark and indistinct, with some blurred objects still visible, focusing attention primarily on the man's face. The video is set within a very dimly lit indoor space, characterized by extremely low-key lighting that primarily illuminates the central subject while plunging the background into near-total darkness. Faint outlines behind the subject suggest the presence of furniture, possibly the top of a wooden chair. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, using a shallow depth of field to focus on the man in the foreground. While the camera is intended to remain static and is positioned at the man's eye level, it moves slightly forward during the clip, executing a very smooth, minor zoom-in towards the man. This gradual zoom captures his neutral expression, the small mark or scar on his right cheek, and his slightly parted mouth, suggesting he might be speaking. Towards the end of the sequence, he slightly opens his mouth and then closes it, reinforcing the impression that he might be speaking. The overall visual tone is dark and focused, with the man wearing a dark hoodie occupying the center, looking directly forward with a serious expression.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
