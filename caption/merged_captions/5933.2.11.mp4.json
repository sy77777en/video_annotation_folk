  "merged_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of a man with a medium build and a beard, wearing a light brown jacket over a blue shirt, walking through a field of tall, dry grass. He has short, dark hair, carries a backpack, and occupies the center of the frame, with his upper body and part of his legs visible. The man moves steadily from the middle ground towards the foreground, maintaining a central position throughout the sequence. The tall grass surrounds him, filling the foreground and middle ground, while bare trees form the background under a cloudy sky. The setting suggests a late autumn or early winter environment, with soft, diffused sunlight casting a warm glow over the scene. The camera is at eye level and initially at a level angle, capturing the man's movement as he pushes aside the reeds with his hands. The video is in slow motion, making actions appear slower than real-time. The camera then shifts to a low angle, using deep focus with a large depth of field, and moves backward while panning left, leading the man in the foreground. The movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking. The reeds sway gently, indicating a light breeze, and the overall atmosphere is calm and natural, with the earthy tones of the reeds contrasting against the muted sky. The man consistently stays in the center, emphasizing his interaction with the environment, and his gaze is directed forward with a neutral expression. The spatial dynamics highlight the man's steady progression through the field, with the reeds swaying slightly around him, adding a sense of scale and interaction with the environment.",

    "Subject": "The video features a man with a medium build and a beard, wearing a light brown jacket over a blue shirt. He has short, dark hair and carries a backpack. The man is walking through a field of tall, dry grass, with his gaze directed forward. His expression is neutral, and he appears to be moving steadily through the landscape.

    "Motion": "A man is walking through a field of tall, dry grass, with his gaze directed forward. He is wearing a light brown jacket over a blue shirt and has a backpack on his back. The background consists of leafless trees under a clear sky. The man moves his arms slightly as he walks, pushing aside the grass with his hands.",
    "Scene": "The video depicts an outdoor setting in a field of tall, golden reeds under a cloudy sky. The time of day appears to be late afternoon, with soft, diffused sunlight casting a warm glow over the scene. Bare trees are visible in the background, suggesting a late autumn or early winter season. The reeds sway gently, indicating a light breeze. The overall atmosphere is calm and natural, with the earthy tones of the reeds contrasting against the muted sky. A person is present, moving through the reeds, adding a sense of scale and interaction with the environment.",
    "Spatial": "The video presents a medium shot of a man walking through a field of tall, dry grass. The man occupies the center of the frame, with his upper body and part of his legs visible. He moves steadily from the middle ground towards the foreground, maintaining a central position throughout the sequence. The tall grass surrounds him, filling the foreground and middle ground, while bare trees form the background. The camera remains at a level angle with the subject, capturing his movement as he pushes aside the reeds with his hands. There are no significant changes in shot size or camera angle; the man consistently stays in the center, emphasizing his interaction with the environment. The spatial dynamics highlight the man's steady progression through the field, with the reeds swaying slightly around him."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
