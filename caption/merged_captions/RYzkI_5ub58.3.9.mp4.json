  "merged_caption": "A full shot captures a hawksbill sea turtle positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, swimming over a sandy seafloor. The turtle's carapace has a mottled pattern of brown, amber, and black, and its head and flippers are covered in a distinct, scale-like pattern of black and a lighter, yellowish-white color. The turtle is surrounded by various coral formations that occupy the middle ground and background, with a prominent, yellowish brain coral with a maze-like texture initially visible in the lower-right-center-ground. As the turtle swims slowly and gracefully, it propels itself forward with deliberate, simultaneous flapping of its front flippers, gliding just above the sandy seafloor and various coral formations. The camera, positioned above the subject, tracks the sea turtle from the side, moving from left to right. As the turtle swims forward and to the right, the camera moves to keep it centered, causing the brain coral to shift to the lower-left foreground. The camera also moves forward and pans slightly left to keep the turtle in frame, with a slightly unsteady movement. A deep focus keeps both the turtle and the surrounding vibrant ecosystem, filled with various coral formations including tan branching corals and convoluted, yellow-green brain corals, sharp. Sunlight penetrates the clear blue water, casting shifting light patterns across the seabed.",

    "Camera": "This underwater, high-angle shot tracks a sea turtle from the side, moving from left to right. As the turtle swims, the camera also moves forward and pans slightly left to keep it in frame. The camera movement is slightly unsteady, and a deep focus keeps both the turtle and the surrounding coral reef sharp.",
    "Subject": "A hawksbill sea turtle is shown swimming in an underwater environment. Its carapace, or upper shell, has a mottled pattern of brown, amber, and black. The turtle's head and flippers are covered in a distinct, scale-like pattern of black and a lighter, yellowish-white color. It is positioned over a sandy seafloor populated with various types of coral, including branching corals and a prominent, yellowish brain coral with a maze-like texture.",
    "Motion": "A hawksbill sea turtle swims slowly and gracefully over a coral reef, propelling itself forward with deliberate, simultaneous flapping of its front flippers. It glides just above the sandy seafloor and various coral formations, moving steadily across the frame.",
    "Scene": "An underwater scene unfolds on a sunlit coral reef, where a large sea turtle with a dark, mottled shell swims slowly over the sandy ocean floor. The turtle's head and flippers are covered in a distinct black-and-white geometric pattern. The surrounding environment is a vibrant ecosystem filled with various coral formations, including tan branching corals and convoluted, yellow-green brain corals. Sunlight penetrates the clear blue water, casting shifting light patterns across the seabed.",
    "Spatial": "A full shot captures a hawksbill sea turtle positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, swimming over a sandy seafloor. The turtle is surrounded by various coral formations that occupy the middle ground and background, with a prominent brain coral initially visible in the lower-right-center-ground. As the turtle swims forward and to the right, the camera moves to keep it centered, causing the brain coral to shift to the lower-left foreground. The camera is positioned above the subject."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
