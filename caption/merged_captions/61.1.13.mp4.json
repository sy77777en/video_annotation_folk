  "merged_caption": "In a dimly lit establishment at night, characterized by a warm, greenish-yellow ambient glow, a Black man with long dreadlocks and a graying beard and mustache is positioned in the center of a medium close-up frame. He wears a light-colored fedora-style hat, white square-framed sunglasses, a green jacket over a red, white, and black patterned shirt, and a pearl necklace. On his wrists, he has a gold-colored watch and beaded bracelets, and he wears a large, shiny ring on his right hand. The camera, from a low, eye-level perspective, uses a shallow depth of field to focus on him in the foreground. A person's hand is visible in the foreground on the right, adding depth to the composition. Behind him, two women are sitting in the middle ground, contributing to the lively atmosphere. In the background, red curtains hang on the right side of the frame, and framed pictures are on the wall. A person is seated in a brown booth, with the interior lighting creating a hazy atmosphere, and a faint white neon light can be seen further in the background. The man gestures with both hands raised near his face before quickly leaning forward and to his right, lowering his upper body and moving toward the bottom of the frame, briefly closer to the camera. The camera pans left with a slightly unsteady, shaky motion, capturing his energetic movements within the confined space. The woman in the background remains seated and relatively still. The camera remains at the subject's level, maintaining focus on the man's dynamic gestures and expressions.",

    "Camera": "From a low, eye-level perspective, the camera uses a shallow depth of field to focus on the man in the foreground. The camera pans left with a slightly unsteady, shaky motion.",
    "Subject": "The main subject is a Black man with long dreadlocks and a graying beard and mustache, who is sitting and gesturing with his hands. He wears a light-colored fedora-style hat, white square-framed sunglasses, a green jacket over a red, white, and black patterned shirt, and a pearl necklace. On his wrists, he has a gold-colored watch and beaded bracelets, and he wears a large, shiny ring on his right hand. In the background, to his left, a white woman with long blonde hair is also visible, sitting down.",
    "Motion": "The man, who is sitting, gestures with both hands raised near his face before quickly leaning forward and to his right, lowering his upper body. The woman in the background remains seated and relatively still.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set inside a dimly lit establishment at night, characterized by a warm, greenish-yellow ambient glow. In the foreground, a person's hand is visible, adding depth to the composition. In the middle ground, two individuals are seated behind a Black man, contributing to the lively atmosphere. In the background, deep red curtains hang next to a window, and framed pictures are visible on the wall. A person is seated in a brown booth, with the interior lighting creating a hazy atmosphere. A faint white neon light can be seen further in the background. The camera remains close to the main subject, capturing their energetic movements within the confined space.",
    "Spatial": "In a medium close-up shot, a man is positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. Behind him, two women are sitting in the middle ground. Another person's hand is visible in the foreground on the right. In the background, red curtains hang on the right side of the frame, and framed pictures are on the wall behind the man. The man initially gestures with his hands near his face before leaning to his side, moving toward the bottom of the frame and briefly closer to the camera. The camera remains at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
