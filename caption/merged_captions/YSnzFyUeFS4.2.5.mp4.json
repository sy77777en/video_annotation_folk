  "merged_caption": "From a first-person, eye-level perspective, the scene initially captures a wide view of a sunny, late-afternoon city street. A silver and black fire hydrant is positioned in the bottom-left middle ground. In the middle ground, a black motorcycle is parked on the left, next to a large tree in the center-left. To the right of the tree, a restaurant with patrons seated at outdoor tables occupies the right side of the frame. A woman with dark brown hair, wearing a blue top and jeans, walks toward the camera from the center middle ground. Initially, only a small part of two arms, one with a prominent tattoo on the left and the other on the right, and a black camera are visible in the foreground. The hands and camera then move downward before lifting again into the center, reframing the shot. The camera and hands now occupy the central foreground, partially obscuring the original view and creating a frame-within-a-frame effect. This point-of-view shot is filmed with a lens that creates mild barrel distortion, causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward. The camera is held at eye-level with a level angle, though it is set at a fixed Dutch angle throughout. A deep focus keeps the entire street scene sharp. The camera is slightly unsteady and performs a minor upward tilt. On the right, a man with short, dark hair wearing a blue polo shirt and a woman with dark, shoulder-length hair in a patterned dress are seated facing each other at a small outdoor table, eating. Back-to-back with the woman with dark, shoulder-length hair, another woman with long, brown hair in a blue denim jacket sits at a separate table, looking at her phone. In the background, a person rides a bicycle, moving from the middle ground to the background.",

    "Subject": "From a first-person perspective, a light-skinned arm with a large, dark tattoo on the forearm holds a black camera, pointing it toward a street scene. On the right, a man with short, dark hair wearing a blue polo shirt and a woman with dark, shoulder-length hair in a patterned dress are seated facing each other at a small outdoor table, eating. Back-to-back with the woman with dark, shoulder-length hair, another woman with long, brown hair in a blue denim jacket sits at a separate table, looking at her phone. Walking on the sidewalk toward the camera is a woman with dark brown hair, wearing a blue top and jeans. To the left, a black motorcycle is parked on the street, adjacent to the sidewalk, and a silver and black fire hydrant is visible in the middle ground.",
    "Motion": "From a first-person perspective, two arms raise a black camera into the frame, with only one arm being tattooed, aiming it toward a street scene. As the camera is held in position, a woman walks along the sidewalk toward the camera. In the background, a person rides a bicycle, moving from the middle ground to the background. The people seated at the outdoor tables display some hand movements.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a sunny, late-afternoon city street. The warm, golden light casts long shadows across the concrete sidewalk, where a green-leafed tree grows next to a glass-enclosed outdoor dining structure. On the right, a restaurant with a black awning and a mural has patrons seated at outdoor tables. The scene includes brick buildings with fire escapes, a parked black motorcycle, and a silver and black fire hydrant in the middle ground. Two arms, one tattooed, are visible raising a black camera, framing the view of pedestrians on the sidewalk.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
