  "merged_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a quiet residential neighborhood on a rainy day, capturing the entire breadth of the street and surrounding houses. Initially, the camera focuses on a wet street extending into the distance, with utility poles and wires running along the left side and modern houses on the right. The handheld camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, capturing a deep focus with a large depth of field. As the camera operator walks, the camera slowly pans to the right, revealing more of the street and the buildings on the right side, including a white building with a garden in front. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking, and the camera primarily focuses on the street view. As the camera continues to move, more parked cars come into view in the middle ground, including a silver car and a red car, along with additional houses. The camera further pans to show even more parked cars in the middle ground and houses in both the middle ground and background, with the street still wet from the rain. The houses, with their light and dark facades, are positioned in the middle ground, while some parked cars occupy the foreground and others are located in the middle ground. The camera remains at eye level throughout, providing a consistent perspective of the scene. The transition from the initial view of the street to the broader view of the neighborhood is smooth, maintaining the same wide shot size and gradually revealing more elements within the frame. The overall spatial composition emphasizes the tranquility and scale of the urban setting, with the rain creating a subtle sheen on all surfaces, enhancing the subdued, cool-toned color palette of the scene.",

    "Camera": "The handheld camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, capturing a deep focus with a large depth of field. As the camera operator walks, the camera pans right and slightly moves forward at the intersection turn, then continues forward along the new street direction. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking, and the camera primarily focuses on the street view.",
    "Subject": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing a quiet residential neighborhood on a rainy day. The focus is on the broad, wet streets lined with modern houses, parked cars, and lush green hedges, all under a soft, overcast sky that diffuses the light and enhances the tranquil atmosphere. There is no main subject because the emphasis is on the overall environment and mood, highlighting the calmness and scale of the urban setting rather than any specific object or individual.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a view of a wet street on a rainy day, with houses and greenery on both sides. The camera slowly pans to the right, revealing more of the street and the buildings on the right side, including a white building with a garden in front. As the camera continues to move, more parked cars come into view in the middle ground, including a silver car and a red car, along with additional houses. The camera further pans to show even more parked cars in the middle ground and houses in both the middle ground and background, with the street still wet from the rain.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves through a quiet residential neighborhood outdoors on a rainy day. The streets are wet, with smooth pavement reflecting the overcast sky and muted daylight. Modern houses with light and dark facades line both sides of the road, some with small, neatly trimmed green hedges and others with stone or tile accents. Utility poles and wires run parallel to the street, and several parked cars in shades of red, black, and silver are visible along the curb and in driveways. The sidewalks are bordered by low curbs and occasional patches of greenery, while the rain creates a subtle sheen on all surfaces, enhancing the subdued, cool-toned color palette of the scene.",

Initially, the camera focuses on a wet street extending into the distance, with utility poles and wires running along the left side and modern houses on the right. As the camera pans to the right, it reveals more of the street, showing parked cars in various colors in designated parking spots along the curb on both the left and right sides. The houses, with their light and dark facades, are positioned in the middle ground, while some parked cars occupy the foreground and others are located in the middle ground.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
