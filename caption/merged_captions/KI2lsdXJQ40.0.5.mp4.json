  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot from above, showing a long-sleeve shirt with a red base and white polka dots floating horizontally from the center toward the right. The camera smoothly trucks to the right, tracking the shirt's movement, which remains in the center or left side of the frame. As the camera follows the shirt, a small, rectangular suitcase with a hard shell and handle is partially visible from the right side and gradually becomes fully revealed, occupying the center-right. The suitcase, resting on a pale, whitewashed wooden floor with visible horizontal planks and subtle weathered texture, is soft and fabric-textured in muted gray. Once the suitcase is centered in the frame, the camera becomes stationary. The suitcase is fully open and viewed directly from above, filling most of the frame and positioned in the center. Inside, the shirt is now neatly folded and placed on the right side of the suitcase, occupying the center-right, while several rolled-up pieces of light-colored clothing, such as white and gray, are arranged above it. The shirt’s collar and buttons are clearly visible, making it the most visually prominent item among the packed clothing. The lighting is even and cool, suggesting daytime with no direct sunlight or shadows except for a soft shadow cast by the suitcase. The camera remains at a high angle above the subjects throughout, with no change in camera height. The spatial dynamic shifts from a moving shot that tracks the shirt and suitcase to a static view that clearly displays the arrangement of the packed items. This stop-motion video is captured from a bird's-eye view with a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",

    "Camera": "This stop-motion video is captured from a bird's-eye view with a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera smoothly trucks to the right, tracking a pair of red pajamas as they are placed into a suitcase, before coming to a stop. The camera's height cannot be determined without additional background information.",
    "Subject": "The video begins with a camera tracking a floating long-sleeve shirt with a red base color and white polka dots, moving to the right. As the camera continues, it reveals a small, rectangular suitcase with a hard shell and a handle. Once the suitcase is centered in the frame, the camera remains still, showing the suitcase open to reveal its contents. Inside, the shirt is neatly folded and positioned on the right side of the suitcase. Beside it, several rolled-up pieces of clothing in light colors, such as white and gray, are arranged. The suitcase and its contents are viewed from above, with the shirt’s collar and buttons clearly visible, making it the most visually prominent item among the packed clothing.",
    "Motion": "The long-sleeve shirt floats to the right as the camera follows its movement. The camera then reveals a suitcase, which remains stationary as the shirt is placed inside. The suitcase is opened to show the shirt now folded and positioned on the right side, with several rolled-up pieces of clothing arranged beside it. No further movement occurs after the floating shirt enters the suitcase and positions itself.",
    "Scene": "The video takes place indoors on a pale, whitewashed wooden floor with visible horizontal planks and subtle weathered texture. A soft, fabric-textured suitcase in muted gray rests on the floor, its rectangular shape and rounded corners clearly defined. Initially, a neatly folded, long-sleeved shirt in a faded red color with white polka dots is outside the suitcase and gradually floats into it. Several rolled-up items in light gray and white tones are arranged beside the shirt. The lighting is even and cool, suggesting daytime with no direct sunlight or shadows except for a soft shadow cast by the suitcase. The scene tracks the floating shirt to the right, focusing on the suitcase and its contents within the simple, uncluttered setting after the suitcase is shown in the center of the frame. No overlays, text, or additional visual elements are present.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a full shot from above, showing a long-sleeve shirt with a red base and white polka dots floating horizontally from the center toward the right.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
