  "merged_caption": "The video captures a group of people distributed across the frame in an outdoor park or zoo setting, with a metal fence running horizontally in the middle ground. The scene is shot from a first-person POV at eye level, maintaining a level angle and using deep focus to keep all elements sharp and clear. The environment is open and spacious, with bright natural light and lush green trees providing a leafy canopy overhead. The ground is paved and bordered by metal railings, separating the walkway from an enclosed area featuring large rocks and a few low, beige buildings in the background. A woman in a white shirt and pants stands near the center, next to a stroller and a child in a red shirt, both slightly right of center. To their left, a man in light clothing leans on the fence, while a woman in a dark jacket and skirt stands nearby, both left of center. Additional people are spaced along the fence, including a man in a white top and green pants with an orange mask on the left and a woman in a yellow top and blue jeans at the far left. The camera moves forward throughout the video, advancing toward the people standing by the fence, and near the end, it slightly pans to the right, with some noticeable shaking. Several people stand or walk near the fenced area under large trees. A child stands in front of the fence, holding onto the railing and looking inside the enclosure, while a woman supervises nearby. A man wearing an orange mask holds a phone in his left hand and looks into the enclosure as he walks away from the fence. A woman in a yellow top walks from the left side of the frame to the right, with her head lowered. A couple initially leans on the railing; the woman, dressed in black, walks away to the left and then returns, while the man continues to lean on the railing. A person pushes a stroller, and another child sits on a bench, remaining stationary. Most movement consists of slow walking or standing, with occasional glances or gestures toward the enclosure.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, looking straight ahead. It uses deep focus, keeping all elements in the scene—such as people near the fence, strollers, and the background trees—sharp and clear. The camera moves forward throughout the video, advancing toward the people standing by the fence, and near the end, it slightly pans to the right. The movement is slightly unsteady, with some noticeable shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video shows several people of varying ages and appearances gathered near a metal fence. Among them is a woman in a white shirt, white pants, and a dark cap, standing next to a stroller and a young child in a red shirt and blue pants. Another man, dressed in light-colored clothing, is seen leaning on the fence, while a woman with long dark hair, wearing a dark jacket and skirt, stands nearby. Additional people include a man wearing a white top, green pants, and an orange mask, as well as a woman in a yellow top beneath a dark jacket, blue jeans, and a light-colored mask. The group appears to be casually observing something beyond the fence, and their clothing and postures suggest a relaxed, everyday outing.",

    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, shows an outdoor setting in a park or zoo during daytime, with bright natural light and lush green trees providing a leafy canopy overhead. The ground is paved and bordered by metal railings, which separate the walkway from an enclosed area featuring large rocks and a few low, beige buildings in the background. Several people are present, some standing near the railings and others walking or pushing strollers, all dressed in casual, light clothing suitable for warm weather. The environment is open and spacious, with the vibrant green foliage dominating the scene and no visible overlays or digital elements present.",
    "Spatial": "The video captures a group of people distributed across the frame in an outdoor park or zoo setting. Most subjects are positioned in the middle ground, with a metal fence running horizontally. The middle ground includes trees, rocks, and people, while low beige buildings are positioned in the background. A woman in a white shirt and pants stands near the center, next to a stroller and a child in a red shirt, both slightly right of center. To their left, a man in light clothing leans on the fence, while a woman in a dark jacket and skirt stands nearby, both left of center. Additional people are spaced along the fence, including a man in a white top and green pants with an orange mask on the left and a woman in a yellow top and blue jeans at the far left. The camera remains at approximately eye level with the standing adults, maintaining a consistent height throughout. There is no significant movement among the subjects, and the spatial arrangement emphasizes the group’s distribution along the fence, with the background scenery providing depth."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
