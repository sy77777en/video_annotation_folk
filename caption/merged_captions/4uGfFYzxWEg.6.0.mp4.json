  "merged_caption": "From a high-angle perspective, the scene is captured with a smooth, subtle camera movement that pans from left to right while rolling clockwise. Two humanoid figures rendered in a white, low-polygon, geometric style are positioned in the middle ground; one is seated on the left side in a blue office chair, wearing a matching white hat and leaning back with its arms crossed, while the other is slightly to the right and lower in the frame, with its back to the viewer, facing a bank of multiple television screens. A long desk extends diagonally from the upper left corner to the lower right corner, with a large bank of CRT monitors arranged on it, filling the upper portion of the frame. On the desk, a single beige keyboard is visible in front of the humanoid figure on the right, and a white mug is located at the upper left of the keyboard. The primary light source is the glow from the monitors, which illuminates the figures and the desk. Each screen displays a close-up of one of two white men. The first man, who appears more frequently, has short light brown hair and is wearing a light-colored collared shirt, suggesting he is a contestant on a game show. The second man, who seems slightly older, is dressed in a brown suit and resembles a game show host. The multiple screens are all tuned to the game show \"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?\", displaying various multiple-choice questions. An overlay in the bottom left corner reads \"ITV - Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? (2001)\", and another text overlay appears in the lower-left quadrant stating \"192 coughs\". The camera maintains a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp.",

The second figure sits to the right, also in a blue office chair, with its back to the viewer, facing a bank of multiple television screens. Each screen displays distinct images of two white men. One man, appearing more frequently, has short light-brown hair and is wearing a light-colored collared shirt, suggesting he is a contestant on a game show.

    "Scene": "From a high-angle perspective, the scene is set in a dark, indoor room dominated by a long wooden desk and a large bank of CRT monitors. Two low-polygon, white, geometric figures occupy blue office chairs at the desk, which holds one beige keyboard positioned in front of the humanoid figure on the right and a white mug to the upper left of the keyboard. Each screen displays a close-up of one of two white men. The first man, who appears more frequently, has short light brown hair and is wearing a light-colored collared shirt.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
