  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot, a fair-skinned man with a muscular build is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the foreground with his back to the camera. He has blond hair that extends down to the bottom of his neck and is shirtless, wearing a black harness with straps over his shoulders. His arms are raised to shoulder height with his hands open and palms facing forward. The scene is set in a dimly lit indoor space, characterized by a strong blue backlight that creates a silhouette. A dark, slatted wall is situated in the background, while to the left, a vertically ribbed panel and a curved metal rod, possibly supporting a light or another piece of equipment, are visible in the middle ground. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, maintaining a static, eye-level position with a level angle and employing a shallow depth of field to focus on the man in the foreground. Initially, the man holds a static pose with his arms raised and palms facing forward. Towards the end of the video, he slowly turns to the left side of the frame. Two white overlay bars run horizontally across the top and bottom of the video.",

    "Camera": "From a static, eye-level position, the camera maintains a level angle. It employs a shallow depth of field, focusing on the man in the foreground.",
    "Subject": "A fair-skinned man with a muscular build is seen from the back, facing away from the camera. He has blond hair that extends down to the bottom of his neck. He is shirtless and wears a black harness with straps over his shoulders. His arms are raised to shoulder height with his hands open and palms facing forward.",
    "Motion": "The man initially faces away from the camera, holding a static pose with his arms raised and palms facing forward. Towards the end of the video, he slowly turns to the left side of the frame.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set in a dimly lit indoor space, characterized by a strong blue backlight that creates a silhouette. In the dark background, vertical lines suggest a slatted wall or heavy curtains. To the left, a curved metal rod, possibly supporting a light or another piece of equipment, is partially visible along with a vertically ribbed panel. A person with blond hair, seen from behind, stands in the center, wearing a black harness on their bare back with their arms raised. Two white overlay bars run horizontally across the top and bottom of the video.",
    "Spatial": "In a medium shot, a man is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the foreground with his back to the camera.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
