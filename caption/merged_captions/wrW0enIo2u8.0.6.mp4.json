  "merged_caption": "This is a close-up, level-angle shot filmed at ground level, matching the subject's height, which is the person's legs. In the center of the frame, the silhouette of both of the person's lower legs and bare feet is visible on the sand. The person moves from the left side of the frame to the right, passing in front of the fire. A silhouetted person, visible from the legs down, stands barefoot on the sand before taking a slow step forward with their right foot, moving from left to right across the foreground. A large bonfire is positioned in the center-left middle ground. The fire is constructed from numerous branches and twigs arranged in a tall, conical pile. The intense orange and yellow flames illuminate the sand around the base of the fire. The background, visible behind the fire, consists of a body of water and distant hills. At night on a sandy beach, a large bonfire burns brightly, its orange and yellow flames illuminating the immediate area. Behind the legs of the person in the middleground and slightly to the left of the frame, a large bonfire burns brightly, constructed from logs arranged in a teepee-like structure. From a smooth, ground-level perspective, the camera pans left while simultaneously moving right. It maintains a shallow depth of field, keeping the bonfire in the midground in sharp focus. In the background, a dark body of water stretches towards a distant, silhouetted landmass under a dark sky.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
