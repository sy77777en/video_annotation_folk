In the foreground and to the bottom left, a stylized, translucent human figure with a red cross symbol on its upper back kneels on the reflective floor with its head lowered, as if peeking underneath the door of a translucent, frosted white cubicle. Positioned in the middle ground and center-right, the cubicle is prominently elevated on four legs, featuring a visible door and handle. Through the gap at the bottom of the cubicle, the translucent foot of another figure is visible inside. The entire scene is set against a dark, undefined background. The camera, positioned at the level of the translucent, frosted white cubicle, smoothly moves backward from a high-angle, eye-level perspective, maintaining a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp. In the lower left corner of the frame, white text overlay displays \"[10]\". The video shows an image with no movement from any of the subjects.",

The figure is positioned in front of a translucent, frosted white cubicle that resembles a restroom stall, with its head lowered as if peeking underneath the door.

The rectangular structure is open at the top and elevated on four legs, featuring a visible door and handle. In front of the cubicle, a translucent, human-like figure kneels on the floor with its head down, marked by a red cross symbol on its upper back.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
