  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium close-up of a man with light skin, short dark brown hair, and light stubble, wearing a light blue denim jacket over a white t-shirt, positioned slightly left of center in the foreground. In the middle ground, a tall, silver chain-link fence is visible, with out-of-focus buildings and another paved surface in the background. The man walks forward toward the camera, blinking continuously, and as he does, the camera performs a slow, steady pan to the right, transitioning smoothly from a medium close-up to a close-up of his face. The camera remains at the man's eye level throughout the shot, ensuring clarity and focus at every stage. As the shot tightens further into an extreme close-up, his face fills the screen, and the focus is lost, leaving only a blurred view of his lower face and neck, which obscures the background. Initially, the fence and several buildings are visible, but they disappear as the framing focuses more closely on the man. The camera maintains a clear and focused view until the extreme close-up, where the man's neck becomes blurred, and he drifts out of focus, leaving only a blurred view of his neck.",

    "Camera": "This slow-motion, eye-level video maintains a clear and focused view throughout, starting with a medium close-up of the man in the foreground. The camera performs a slow, steady pan to the right, transitioning smoothly into a close-up of his head, and then further tightening into an extreme close-up of his facial features, ensuring clarity and focus at every stage.",
    "Subject": "The video begins with a medium close-up of a man with light skin, short dark brown hair, and light stubble, wearing a light blue denim jacket over a white t-shirt. His jacket is open as he walks towards the camera, blinking continuously. The camera pans to the right to follow his movement, gradually tightening the frame to a close-up of his head and then to an extreme close-up of his face. As the shot progresses, the man drifts out of focus, leaving only a blurred view of his neck. Initially, a fence and several buildings are visible in the background, but they disappear as the framing focuses more closely on the man.",
    "Motion": "A man approaches the camera and then passes by it. As he moves, the camera pans to the right, transitioning smoothly from a medium close-up to a close-up of his face. The shot tightens further into an extreme close-up, where the focus is lost, leaving his neck blurred.",
    "Scene": "In an outdoor, paved area during the day, a man in a denim jacket and white t-shirt walks forward. A tall, silver chain-link fence is positioned behind him, with out-of-focus buildings and another paved surface visible in the background. The camera moves steadily closer to the man, transitioning from a medium close-up to an extreme close-up where his face becomes completely blurred.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium close-up of a man positioned slightly left of center in the foreground. In the middle ground, a chain-link fence is visible. The man walks forward toward the camera, and as he does, the camera pans to the right, transitioning the shot from a medium close-up to a close-up of his face, and finally to an extreme close-up. As the frame tightens, his face fills the screen, eventually becoming completely blurred and leaving only an out-of-focus view of his lower face and neck, which obscures the background. The camera remains at the man's level throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
