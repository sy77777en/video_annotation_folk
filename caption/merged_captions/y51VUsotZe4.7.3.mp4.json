  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of a nighttime cityscape viewed from a high vantage point, likely through large windows, as indicated by two dark vertical window frames positioned in the middle ground on the left and right. The urban environment is illuminated by countless city lights, creating a sprawling network of glowing streets and buildings that extend to the horizon under a dark sky. In the background, a busy highway with moving traffic occupies the bottom left, with a large, lit stadium to its left. The scene offers a clear view of the city, with notable visual elements including the bright, linear patterns of traffic lights on the roads and varied illumination from buildings, some with distinct neon signs. The overall atmosphere is calm and expansive, capturing the vastness of the city at night. Gradually, a man with light skin and short, light-colored hair starts to appear from the lower right side of the frame, as if from below, moving into view. The man becomes more visible as he approaches the window, with his face facing the camera partially illuminated by the city lights. His presence adds a human element to the otherwise expansive city view, creating a contrast between the individual and the vast urban environment. The camera features a level angle with a shallow depth of field, focusing on the cityscape in the background. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement. Towards the end of the video, the man turns his head towards his right, with the busy road and urban environment still visible in the background. In the final composition, the man occupies the right foreground, with the cityscape now visible in the background to the left, as the camera is positioned at his level.",

    "Camera": "The video features a level camera angle with a shallow depth of field, focusing on the cityscape in the background. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.",
    "Subject": "The video reveals a nighttime cityscape viewed through a large window, showcasing a sprawling urban area with numerous lights and a busy road with moving traffic. As the scene progresses, a man is revealed in the foreground. He has light skin and short, light-colored hair. The man is positioned to the right, partially obscuring the view of the city as he comes into focus. His presence adds a human element to the otherwise expansive city view, creating a contrast between the individual and the vast urban environment.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a nighttime cityscape view through a large window, showing a bustling urban area with numerous lights and a busy road with moving traffic. Gradually, a man starts to appear from the lower right side of the frame, as if from below, moving into view. The man becomes more visible as he approaches the window, with his face facing the camera partially illuminated by the city lights. Towards the end of the video, he turns his head towards his right, with the busy road and urban environment still visible in the background.",
    "Scene": "The video showcases a nighttime cityscape viewed from a high vantage point, likely through large windows, as indicated by two vertical bars framing the glass. The urban environment is illuminated by countless city lights, creating a sprawling network of glowing streets and buildings. The scene offers a clear view of the city extending to the horizon, with a dark sky indicating a clear night without visible weather disturbances. Notable visual elements include the bright, linear patterns of traffic lights on the roads and the varied illumination from buildings, some with distinct neon signs. The overall atmosphere is calm and expansive, capturing the vastness of the city at night.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a wide shot of a nighttime cityscape viewed from a high vantage point. Two dark vertical window frames are positioned in the middle ground on the left and right. In the background, a busy highway with moving traffic occupies the bottom left, with a large, lit stadium to its left. The sprawling, illuminated city extends to the horizon. A man's head then slowly enters the frame from the bottom right, moving into the foreground and transitioning the shot into a close-up. In the final composition, the man occupies the right foreground, with the cityscape now visible in the background to the left, as the camera is positioned at his level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
