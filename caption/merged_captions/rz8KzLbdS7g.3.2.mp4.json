  "merged_caption": "The video captures a wide shot of a residential neighborhood, showcasing a narrow street flanked by houses. The camera remains at eye level throughout, providing a consistent perspective with deep focus and a large depth of field. Initially, a blue house occupies the middle ground on the right side of the frame. As the camera moves forward with subtle panning and trucking, the blue house shifts to the foreground on the right before eventually exiting the view. In its place, a distinctively textured building with a white gable comes into focus in the center-right of the frame, transitioning to a closer position within the middle ground as the camera advances. On the left side, a wooden fence runs along, accompanied by lush greenery. The road curves gently, leading the viewer's eye deeper into the scene. Overhead, power lines crisscross the clear blue sky, spanning from the top left to the top right of the frame. The camera maintains a steady pace, smoothly transitioning between different sections of the street while keeping the overall composition balanced. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking. As the camera continues to move forward, it reveals more of the street and the houses ahead, including a wooden house with a white roof and a garden in front, as well as several cars parked under a carport on the right. The camera approaches the wooden house, providing a closer view of its facade and the surrounding greenery. The video ends with a more detailed view of the distinctively textured building with a white gable, highlighting its structure and the well-maintained garden. The spatial dynamics highlight the orderly layout of the neighborhood, with houses and greenery evenly distributed along the road, contributing to the serene ambiance.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
