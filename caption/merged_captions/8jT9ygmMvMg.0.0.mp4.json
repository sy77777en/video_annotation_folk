  "merged_caption": "This scenery shot opens with an extreme wide shot of Venice from a high-angle, aerial perspective, which transitions into a wide shot as the camera flies forward and descends. The Grand Canal runs vertically through the center of the frame, with the white Rialto Bridge positioned at the center top of the frame, and the camera moves steadily towards it. Dense city buildings with red-tiled roofs fill the left and right sides of the frame, extending from the foreground into the background. In the canal, several long white boats and smaller vessels are visible in the middle ground, some moving and others docked along the banks. The sun is positioned in the top right background, illuminating the cityscape. This is a smooth, aerial high-angle shot of Venice, featuring mild barrel distortion. The camera flies forward and downward over the Grand Canal, executing gentle rolls that create a varying Dutch angle. A deep focus keeps the entire cityscape, from the boats in the canal to the buildings in the distance, sharp and clear. The video presents a sweeping aerial cityscape scenery shot of Venice, Italy, captured during a golden sunset. The camera glides down the Grand Canal, moving towards the iconic, white stone Rialto Bridge with its distinct arches. The city's dense architecture, characterized by buildings with red-tiled roofs, is bathed in the warm, low-angled light of the setting sun. On the dark green water of the canal, several long, white water buses (vaporettos) are docked or moving, alongside smaller motorboats and gondolas. There is no single main subject in this shot. The focus is instead on conveying the grand scale and atmospheric beauty of the entire urban landscape, emphasizing the unique interplay of historic architecture, water, and light that defines the city.",

    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone provides an aerial perspective of Venice, Italy, during a golden sunrise. The camera descends over the city's dense cluster of buildings, which feature terracotta-tiled roofs and facades in shades of yellow and orange. The view centers on the Grand Canal, where the iconic Rialto Bridge, a large, white stone structure with arches, spans the dark green water. Several boats, including long white water buses and smaller wooden motorboats, are visible on the canal, some docked along the sides and others navigating the waterway.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
