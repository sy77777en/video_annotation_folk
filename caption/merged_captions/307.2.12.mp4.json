  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a medium-full shot of a Black man positioned in the center of the frame and the foreground, with his arms outstretched. He wears a red headwrap with white circular patterns tied into puffy knots on the sides of his head, a white pearl necklace, and a large, unzipped, blue puffy jacket with a colorful floral pattern and matching pants. The jacket has wide, wing-like sleeves that are spread out, revealing his skin and visible tattoos near his upper body and abdomen. He is situated in a sunlit, open field filled with dry, golden-brown grass, while the middle ground consists of rolling, golden-brown wild grass and hills covered in dark green trees occupy the background under a clear sky. The scene is captured with a grainy, film-like quality, giving it a vintage aesthetic. The camera, which appears to be handheld, begins at a high angle with a varying Dutch angle and slightly pans right. As the man runs forward through the grassy field with his arms extended out to the sides, the camera moves along with him, creating an unstable and increasingly close-up perspective. The camera then zooms in unsteadily, causing the framing to tighten from a medium-full shot into a close-up that centers on the man's face and upper chest as he looks up. As he nears the camera, he tilts his head back to look up at the sky, and the camera angle tilts upward to follow his face, shifting to a level angle. The shot concludes with a pan to the left and a slight zoom-out. The entire scene is captured with a deep focus and a large depth of field.",

    "Scene": "The scene takes place in a sunlit, open field filled with dry, golden-brown grass. In the background, rolling hills are densely covered with dark green trees under a clear sky. A person wearing a colorful, puffy jacket and a red head covering moves through the field with their arms outstretched. The entire scene is captured with a grainy, film-like quality, giving it a vintage aesthetic as the camera follows the person's movement.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
