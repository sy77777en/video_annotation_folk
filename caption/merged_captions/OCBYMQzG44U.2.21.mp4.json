  "merged_caption": "This wide scenery shot is framed from a level angle, with the camera positioned at the surface level of the dark, murky water inside a dimly lit room. The dark, rippling water occupies both the foreground and the middle ground of the frame. In the background, pale green tiled walls fill the top half of the frame, all bathed in a dim, unsettling greenish-yellow light. A dark, arched opening is located in the center of the composition, set into the background wall and partially submerged in the water. The camera moves forward smoothly with minimal shaking, pauses briefly, and then continues its forward motion toward the dark, arched opening in the wall. The video exhibits mild barrel distortion, causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward slightly. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the rippling water in both the foreground and middle ground, as well as the tiled wall in the background, sharp. This is a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, taken from the surface of the water. The scene is designed to establish a mysterious and eerie atmosphere, with no main subject, immersing the viewer in the strange environment rather than focusing on any specific object.",

    "Camera": "This is a level-angle shot taken from just above the water's surface. The video exhibits mild barrel distortion, causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward slightly. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the rippling water in both the foreground and middle ground, as well as the tiled wall in the background, sharp. The camera moves forward smoothly with minimal shaking, pauses briefly, and then continues its forward motion toward the dark, arched opening in the wall.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a liminal space scenery shot of a room partially submerged in dark, murky water. The walls are lined with a grid of small, pale green tiles, all bathed in a dim, unsettling greenish-yellow light. Emerging from the gently rippling surface of the water is the top of a dark, arched opening in the back wall, its interior shrouded in complete blackness. There is no main subject, as the shot's purpose is to establish a mysterious and eerie atmosphere. The camera angle is level with the water's surface, immersing the viewer in the strange environment rather than focusing on any specific object.",
    "Motion": "This is a level-angle shot from the surface of murky, greenish water inside a tiled room. The camera moves forward smoothly with minimal shaking, pausing briefly before continuing its forward motion toward a dark, arched opening partially submerged in the water. The scene is dimly lit with a green hue, and there is gentle rippling on the water's surface.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, is taken from the surface of dark, murky water inside a dimly lit room. The walls are covered in a grid of small, light-green square tiles. Directly ahead, a large, dark, circular opening or pipe emerges from the back wall, partially submerged in the gently rippling water.",
    "Spatial": "This wide scenery shot is framed from a level angle, with the camera positioned at the surface level of the water. The dark, rippling water occupies both the foreground and the middle ground of the frame. In the background, pale green tiled walls fill the top half of the frame. A dark, arched opening is located in the center of the composition, set into the background wall and partially submerged in the water. The camera moves forward smoothly with minimal shaking, pauses briefly, and then continues its forward motion toward the dark, arched opening in the wall."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
