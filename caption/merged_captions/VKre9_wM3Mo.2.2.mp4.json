  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot, three white, translucent toilets are arranged in a diagonal line receding from the center midground to the background on the top right in a dark, undefined space with a glossy black floor. The primary subject, a single toilet, is positioned in the center midground and is clearly in focus, with its lid open and emitting a bright blue glow from within its bowl. This glow casts a soft, white reflection on the floor in the bottom center, directly under the foreground toilet. A second toilet is situated to the right, and a third is in the background, further to the right; both are progressively out of focus, creating a sense of depth. The toilets further back also have their lids open and emit a similar, though fainter, blue glow from their bowls, appearing more diffuse in the darkness. The camera, positioned at a high angle at eye level, moves forward and tilts down in a slow, smooth motion, maintaining a shallow depth of field that keeps the focus on the glowing toilet in the midground, while the others in the background remain blurred. The video shows a scene with minimal movement, where the first toilet appears to be shaking slightly. The toilet in the midground is the most prominent and in focus, illuminated from above by an unseen light source.",

    "Subject": "In a dark, empty space, three white, translucent toilets are arranged in a diagonal line receding into the distance. The toilet in the midground is the most prominent and in focus, with its lid open. It emits a bright blue glow from within its bowl and is illuminated from above by an unseen light source. The two other toilets behind it are progressively dimmer and more out of focus, but they appear to be the same size as the one in the midground. They also have their lids open and emit a similar, though fainter, blue glow from their bowls.",

    "Scene": "In a dark, undefined space with a glossy black floor, a series of translucent toilets are arranged in a diagonal line receding into the background. The toilet in the midground is in focus, emitting a bright blue glow from within its bowl, which casts a soft, white reflection on the surface below. The toilets further back are progressively out of focus, their blue glow appearing more diffuse in the darkness.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
