  "merged_caption": "This wide shot, captured from a high angle, initially frames a cartoon-style humanoid figure with an atypical appearance in the center of the middle ground, standing stationary on a reddish-brown wooden dock in a 2.5D game scene. The figure is clad in a long, blue, hooded cloak that covers its body, revealing only thin, stick-like legs, and its head is a perfectly round, orange sphere with a simple, carved smiling face, resembling a jack-o'-lantern. To the character's left, a stylized, dark-colored fishing rod with an ornate, gear-like base is propped up on a stand in the middle ground. The dock extends from the top right towards the center of the middle ground, with a small wooden boat featuring a cel-shaded art style moored to it in the top-right middle ground. The surrounding teal-colored water, animated with swirling white patterns, fills the foreground, while a grassy shore with a few trees, wooden-colored fences, and a stone well surrounded by a circular brick path occupies the background at the top of the frame. A game HUD with several overlays is visible: a coin icon showing the number 22 in the bottom-left corner, a central inventory bar displaying icons for two bags, a leaf, a stick, and a pink item, and two vertical status bars, one blue and one translucent, in the bottom-right corner. The character then turns and walks up the dock toward the land, moving from the center towards the top center of the frame. From a high, 2.5D game overhead third-person perspective, the camera smoothly tracks the cloaked character, maintaining a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp, and moves upward and slightly to the right to follow the character's movement.",

Next to the figure, a stylized, dark-colored fishing rod with an ornate, gear-like base is propped up on a stand. A small, wooden boat with a cabin is moored at the dock; it features a cel-shaded art style and has a symbol on its door that may not be a peace sign.",
    "Motion": "A humanoid figure with a round orange head and a blue cloak stands stationary on a wooden dock next to a fishing rod. It then turns and walks up the dock toward the land.",
    "Scene": "In a third-person 2.5D game video with a cel-shaded art style, a scene unfolds on a reddish-brown wooden dock extending over teal-colored water animated with swirling white patterns. A small wooden boat is tied to the dock. On the grassy shore behind the dock, there are a few trees, wooden-colored fences, and a stone well surrounded by a circular brick path. A fishing rod is set up on a stand at the end of the dock. The scene includes a game HUD with several overlays: in the bottom-left corner, a coin icon shows the number 22; a central inventory bar displays icons for two bags, a leaf, a stick, and a pink item; and in the bottom-right corner, two vertical status bars, one blue and one translucent, are visible.",
    "Spatial": "This wide shot, captured from a high angle, initially frames a stick-legged, cloaked character in the center of the middle ground, standing on a wooden dock. To the character's left, a fishing rod is propped up in the middle ground. The dock extends from the top right towards the center of the middle ground, with a boat moored to it in the top-right middle ground. The surrounding water fills the foreground, while a grassy shore with a well and trees occupies the background at the top of the frame. A game HUD with a coin count in the bottom-left, an inventory bar at the bottom center, and status bars in the bottom-right is overlaid. The character then walks up the dock, moving from the center towards the top center of the frame, while the camera tracks the character’s movement."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
