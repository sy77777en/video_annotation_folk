  "merged_caption": "This medium shot, filmed at the subjects' level, frames a courtroom scene with a distinct layering of elements. In the foreground, the out-of-focus shoulder and arm of a person occupy the left and bottom of the frame. The main subject, a fair-skinned woman dressed as a barrister, stands in the center-right of the middle ground, wearing a traditional white, curly wig, a black gown over a white collared shirt with barrister's bands. She leans forward slightly, with her right hand resting on the wooden rail in front of her, and turns her body to the left, facing the camera as she speaks. In front of her, also in the middle ground, a seated male barrister, dressed similarly, is seen from behind in the center of the frame. The background is filled with a diverse group of men and women seated on tiered benches across the upper portion of the shot, observing the scene, with a man in a dark uniform standing at the top left. The scene is set within a traditional courtroom, characterized by dark, wood-paneled walls and matching wooden furniture. Natural light filters into the room through a window covered with white horizontal blinds. The video captures the female barrister's movement as she turns to face the camera, while the seated male barrister, the man in uniform, and the observers in the gallery remain mostly still, occasionally adjusting their head positions as they listen to her. This is a static, eye-level shot with a level angle. The camera employs a deep focus, maintaining sharpness and clarity throughout the courtroom scene, from the barristers in the middle ground to the jury in the background, although the person's right arm in the left foreground is out of focus.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
