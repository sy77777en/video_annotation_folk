  "merged_caption": "This wide shot, captured from a high angle above the ice, initially frames a hockey player in a gold and black uniform in the center-left middle ground, skating toward the right while controlling the puck and maintaining offensive pressure. The camera smoothly pans right with slight tilts to follow the hockey players as they skate down the ice. In the background, a player in a dark blue and red uniform is at the top left, while two players are at the top right. The team in gold and black consistently keeps possession, while players in dark blue and red uniforms focus on defending and attempting to intercept the puck. The player in the gold and black uniform remains in the middle ground throughout the sequence. As the camera continues to pan, another player in a dark blue and red uniform enters the center of the frame from the right side. The scene is set on an indoor ice hockey rink, captured from an elevated, overhead perspective that provides a wide view of the action. The vast expanse of white ice is marked with thin red lines, a thicker blue line, and a large, faint grey logo at its center. Surrounding the playing surface are white boards topped with clear panels. Several players are in motion across the ice, some wearing dark jerseys with red and white details and others in gold and black uniforms. A figure in a black and white striped jersey is also present, overseeing the game. The players, equipped with hockey sticks, skate swiftly across the rink, maneuvering around a small black puck. A deep focus keeps most of the rink and a significant number of players in sharp view.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
