  "merged_caption": "In a medium close-up shot, a man is positioned in the left midground, his back to the camera, while a woman is in the right midground, shown in profile facing left. The man wears a dark suit jacket and has short, graying hair and a visible beard. The woman, with fair skin and shoulder-length, straight brown hair, wears a black top and maintains a neutral, serious expression. To their right and in front of them, in the distance, several rows of out-of-focus people are visible in the background, seated in what appears to be a courtroom characterized by rows of dark wooden pews with a warm, medium-brown finish. Light enters from windows with white blinds in the background, illuminating the space. The camera is at eye level and maintains a level angle, using a shallow depth of field with the focus on the midground. The camera remains static throughout the scene, which is largely static with only minor movement from the subjects or the background. Towards the end of the sequence, the woman subtly nods her head, indicating her agreement. A wooden pew is in the foreground, framing the bottom of the shot. The overall atmosphere is formal, with individuals dressed in dark, muted colors.",

    "Subject": "The video shows a man and a woman seated in the midground, likely in a courtroom or formal assembly, with several other people visible in the blurred background. The man, positioned to the left and seen from the back, wears a dark suit jacket and has short, graying hair and a visible beard. To his right, the woman is shown in profile, facing towards the left side of the frame. She has fair skin, shoulder-length, straight brown hair, and is wearing a black top. Her expression is neutral and serious. Behind them, several rows of people are seated, though they are out of focus. The setting features wooden pews or benches.",
    "Motion": "The scene remains static with only minor movement from the subjects or the background. The woman subtly nods her head towards the end of the sequence, indicating her agreement.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set indoors, in what appears to be a courtroom, characterized by rows of dark wooden pews with a warm, medium-brown finish. Light enters from windows with white blinds in the background, illuminating the space. Several people are seated in the pews, facing forward. The overall atmosphere is formal, with individuals dressed in dark, muted colors.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
