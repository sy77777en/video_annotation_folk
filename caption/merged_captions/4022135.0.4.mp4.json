  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a high-angle medium shot from the upper stands of a crowded outdoor football stadium, featuring spectators in the foreground who occupy the lower right portion of the frame. A fair-skinned man with short, graying hair is seen from the side, wearing a dark baseball cap and a gray hooded sweatshirt, sitting and looking towards the field. Next to him are other spectators, including a man in a white baseball cap and a gray jacket, and another man in a blue long-sleeved shirt. A purple railing extends from the bottom left to the upper right. In the middle ground to the left, a portion of the green football field marked with white lines is visible, while the opposite stands and a large beige-colored building inscribed with \"RYAN FIELD\" are positioned in the middle ground on the right. The stadium is filled with thousands of spectators, many dressed in purple and yellow, packing the stands on all sides. Below, on the field, two teams of players in uniforms are visible from a distance near the touchlines. The word \"WILDCATS\" is painted in large purple letters in the end zone. The camera, from a high vantage point in the stands, performs a smooth, steady pan to the left, shifting the composition to a wide, high-angle shot of the stadium. This movement reveals more of the football field, the players gathered near the touchline, and the large crowd in the opposite stands. As the pan concludes, the initial spectators are no longer in view, replaced by the back of a person's head in the bottom center foreground. The football field now dominates the middle ground, stretching across the frame, with the expansive, crowded stands on the far side filling the background. In the background, beyond the stadium, a dense line of green trees is visible, with a city skyline in the far distance under an overcast sky.",

    "Camera": "From a high vantage point in the stands, this eye-level, level-angle shot uses a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. The camera performs a smooth, steady pan to the left, revealing more of the football stadium and the game in progress.",
    "Subject": "The video captures a scene at a crowded outdoor football stadium from the perspective of the audience. In the foreground, a fair-skinned man with short, graying hair is seen from the side, wearing a dark baseball cap and a gray hooded sweatshirt. He is sitting and looking towards the field. Next to him are other spectators, including a man in a white baseball cap and a gray jacket, and another man in a blue long-sleeved shirt. The stands are packed with a large crowd of people, many of whom are wearing purple and yellow clothing. Below, on the green football field marked with white lines, two teams of players in uniforms are visible from a distance. The word \"WILDCATS\" is painted in large purple letters in the end zone. The camera pans to the left, revealing a wider view of the stadium, the full expanse of the field, and the packed stands on the opposite side under an overcast sky. A large, light-colored building with a tower stands behind the far end of the stadium.",
    "Motion": "The camera, initially with a view from the stands, pans to the left. This movement shifts the perspective to a wide shot of the football field, revealing players gathered near the touchline and the large crowd in the opposite stands.",
    "Scene": "A wide shot from the upper stands of a crowded football stadium, Ryan Field, captures a game under an overcast sky. The green field below is marked with white yard lines and features a large purple end zone with \"WILDCATS\" written in white. Two teams are visible on the field near the touchlines. The stadium is filled with thousands of spectators, many dressed in purple, packing the stands on all sides. In the background, beyond the stadium, a dense line of green trees is visible, with a city skyline in the far distance. A prominent beige-colored building with \"RYAN FIELD\" inscribed on its side stands on the right of the stadium. The perspective pans to the left, offering a broader view of the entire stadium and the game unfolding below.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
