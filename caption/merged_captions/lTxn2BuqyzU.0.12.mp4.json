  "merged_caption": "This close-up shot focuses on an animated young boy with fair skin and short brown hair, whose face remains in the foreground throughout. Initially, his face is framed by two hands, with the right hand pulling his eye open and the left hand pushing his cheek. The camera is positioned at eye level with a high angle, looking down, employing a shallow depth of field to focus on the boy. The boy's facial expressions transition from eye-rolling to a look of confusion, marked by continuous eye movement, as he makes a series of exaggerated, playful faces. The hands briefly leave his face and then slap both sides, adding to the playful nature of the scene. Two green, vine-like structures are consistently in his ears, and in the background, blurred green, vine-like structures are visible against pale, neutral-colored walls. The scene is captured from a first-person POV, as if through the character’s eyes, within an indoor setting. The lighting is diffuse, and the focus remains tightly on the character in the foreground throughout the shot. The camera remains fixed, displaying no noticeable unsteadiness or intentional movement.",

    "Subject": "The video features an animated young boy with fair skin and short brown hair. His facial expressions transition from eye-rolling to a look of confusion, marked by continuous eye movement. Another person's hands are involved, initially using one hand to open his right eye, followed by both hands slapping his cheeks. His actions suggest he is either responding to something unseen or making exaggerated, goofy faces.",
    "Motion": "An animated boy has his right eye opened by a hand that appears to belong to another person. The boy then makes a series of eye movements and exaggerated, playful facial expressions. Finally, both hands slap his cheeks, adding to the playful nature of the scene.",
    "Scene": "From a first-person POV, as if through the character’s eyes, the scene is a close-up of a cartoon figure within an indoor setting. The background is softly blurred, featuring pale, neutral-colored walls, while green, curving, vine-like structures are on the floor. The lighting is diffuse, and the focus remains tightly on the character in the foreground throughout the shot.",
    "Spatial": "This close-up shot focuses on an animated boy's face, which remains in the foreground throughout. Initially, his face is framed by two hands, with the right hand pulling his eye open and the left hand pushing his cheek. The hands briefly leave his face and then slap both sides. Two green, vine-like structures are consistently in his ears. In the background, blurred green, vine-like structures are visible.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
