  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a full shot of an ornate golden key floating and rotating in the center of the frame, positioned in the foreground. The key features a complex, swirling, filigree-like bow and a simple bit. In the middle ground, an old beige computer monitor is visible in the center-right, and a large wooden chest occupies the bottom-left. The chest, resting on a patterned rug, is reinforced with dark metal straps, each adorned with a metallic, four-leaf clover-shaped embellishment. A prominent, shield-shaped metal plate on the front of the chest features a keyhole, which is framed by a short, dangling chain. A classical statue stands in the left background. The camera begins at a level angle and transitions to a high-angle shot as it tilts downward. It trucks leftward, initially moving down and then tilting down to follow the ornate key as it simultaneously floats, rotates, and moves downward in mid-air. The shot starts with the focus on the key in the foreground and then performs a rack focus to the wooden chest in the midground as the key moves toward it. The camera follows the key as it moves away from the old computer monitor perched on a wooden stool and drifts toward the large wooden treasure chest. The key aligns with the chest's keyhole, while a patterned rug is visible at the bottom of the frame. The key is positioned to enter the keyhole, as if to unlock the chest. In the background, a classical-style statue is partially visible. The scene is set in a dimly lit room with red-striped wallpaper, enhancing the mysterious atmosphere as the key approaches the chest.",

    "Subject": "An ornate, golden key is shown floating and rotating. It features a complex, swirling, filigree-like bow and a simple bit. The key moves toward a large, dark wooden chest with a rounded lid. The chest is reinforced with dark metal straps, each adorned with a metallic, four-leaf clover-shaped embellishment. A prominent, shield-shaped metal plate on the front of the chest features a keyhole, which is framed by a short, dangling chain. The key is positioned to enter the keyhole, as if to unlock the chest.",
    "Motion": "An ornate golden key simultaneously floats, rotates, and moves downward in mid-air before positioning itself directly in front of the keyhole of a large wooden chest.",
    "Scene": "In a dimly lit room with red-striped wallpaper, an ornate golden key floats through the air. The camera follows the key as it moves away from an old, beige computer monitor perched on a wooden stool and drifts toward a large wooden treasure chest resting on a patterned rug. The chest is bound with dark metal straps and has a prominent lock on its front, into which the key inserts itself. In the background, a classical-style statue is partially visible.",
    "Spatial": "The video opens with a full shot of an ornate golden key floating and rotating in the center of the frame, positioned in the foreground. In the middle ground, an old computer monitor is visible in the center-right, and a large wooden chest occupies the bottom-left. A classical statue stands in the left background. The camera trucks left with a slight pan, following the key as it moves toward the chest. The key aligns with the chest's keyhole, while a patterned rug is visible at the bottom of the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
