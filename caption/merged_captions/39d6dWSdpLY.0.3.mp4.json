  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot, a skier wearing a bright red jacket, black pants, and a black helmet is initially positioned in the center-left middle ground on a snow-covered slope, with a large snow ramp occupying the right and center middle ground. The background consists of a mountain on the left and a bright sky with white clouds filling the top and top-right of the frame. The camera is positioned at the skier's level, following the skier from the side with a smooth tracking shot that exhibits mild barrel distortion. As the skier glides toward the snow ramp, the camera moves in a continuous counter-clockwise arc, causing the skier to grow larger in the frame. Starting at an eye-level, level angle, the camera rolls counter-clockwise, creating a varying Dutch angle. As the skier approaches the ramp holding ski poles, the camera tilts up, shifting to a low angle to capture the action from below. The skier launches into the air, and while airborne, begins a rotation, twisting their body and bringing their skis up. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the skier and the snowy mountain background sharp. As the camera arcs counterclockwise, the large snow ramp gradually shifts to the bottom-left foreground. In the final framing, the airborne skier is in the center-left middle ground, silhouetted against the bright sun and sky which now fills the upper portion of the frame, while the snowy landscape is relegated to the bottom. The video concludes with the skier still in mid-air, their legs extended parallel to the ground, suggesting that the maneuver was not completed. The scene is set against a backdrop of distant, tree-dotted mountains, enhancing the wide, open feel of the bright, sunny day.",

    "Subject": "A skier wearing a bright red jacket, black pants, and a black helmet performs a jump off a snow ramp. The skier approaches the ramp holding ski poles and then launches into the air. While airborne, the skier's body is twisted, and the video ends with the skier's legs extended parallel to the ground, suggesting that the maneuver was not completed.",
    "Motion": "A skier glides toward a snow ramp and launches into the air. While airborne, the skier begins a rotation, twisting their body and bringing their skis up. The video concludes with the skier still in mid-air, their legs extended parallel to the ground.",
    "Scene": "On a bright, sunny day, a skier in a red jacket glides across a wide, snow-covered mountain slope. The scene is set against a backdrop of a blue sky with white clouds and distant, tree-dotted mountains. The skier approaches a large snow ramp and launches into the air, seen mid-flight against the bright sun and sky.",
    "Spatial": "In a wide shot, a skier is initially positioned in the center-left middle ground on a snow-covered slope, with a large snow ramp occupying the right and center middle ground. The background consists of a mountain on the left and a bright sky filling the top and top-right of the frame. The camera is positioned at the skier's level. As the skier launches off the ramp, the camera's perspective shifts to a low-angle shot from below the subject, and as the camera arcs counterclockwise, the large snow ramp gradually shifts to the bottom-left foreground. In the final framing, the airborne skier is in the center-left middle ground, silhouetted against the sky which now fills the upper portion of the frame, while the snowy landscape is relegated to the bottom."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
