  "merged_caption": "This is a wide shot of an urban landscape with no main subject. The scene is viewed through the diamond-patterned grid of a gray, metal chain-link fence that occupies the foreground, filling the frame. The camera is positioned at a level angle, looking onto a sunken, multi-lane highway with flowing traffic in the bottom half of the frame. Cars travel along the dark asphalt road, which is situated beneath a concrete overpass. Directly above the highway, another overpass spans the upper-middle portion of the frame, where a train is visible against a backdrop of urban buildings and bare trees on a sunlit day. In the background, buildings are visible in the top right, situated behind the overpass. The sky above is a pale, clear blue. The camera uses a deep focus to keep the highway traffic below in sharp view, while the fence in the foreground appears slightly out of focus. The camera smoothly pans to the left during the clip, capturing the layered, industrial atmosphere of the urban environment and emphasizing the overall scene and its sense of scale rather than any individual element.",

    "Camera": "Filmed from a level angle through a chain-link fence, this shot uses a deep focus to keep the highway traffic below in sharp view, while the fence in the foreground appears slightly out of focus. The camera moves smoothly to the left.",
    "Subject": "This is a cityscape scenery shot viewed through the diamond-patterned mesh of a chain-link fence, which occupies the foreground. Below, cars travel along a multi-lane highway, while in the background, another bridge or overpass crosses above the road, with buildings visible beyond it. There is no main subject in this video; the composition, framed by the fence, emphasizes the layered, industrial atmosphere of the urban environment. The focus is on the overall scene and its sense of scale rather than any individual element.",
    "Motion": "This video captures a scenery shot from behind a chain-link fence, with a level angle view of a sunken highway appearing in the lower half of the frame. In the background, an overpass with a train crosses above the road, and city buildings are visible. The camera subtly shifts to the left during the clip.",
    "Scene": "Viewed through the diamond-patterned grid of a gray, metal chain-link fence, a multi-lane highway with flowing traffic unfolds below. Cars travel along the dark asphalt road, which is situated beneath a concrete overpass. On the overpass, a train is visible against a backdrop of urban buildings and bare trees on a sunlit day. The sky above is a pale, clear blue.",
    "Spatial": "This is a wide shot of an urban landscape with no main subject. The scene is viewed through a chain-link fence that occupies the foreground, filling the frame. The camera smoothly pans to the left, capturing a multi-lane highway with moving cars in the bottom half of the frame. Directly above the highway, another overpass spans the upper-middle portion of the frame. In the background, buildings are visible in the top right, situated behind the overpass. The camera is positioned at a level angle, looking onto the highway."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
