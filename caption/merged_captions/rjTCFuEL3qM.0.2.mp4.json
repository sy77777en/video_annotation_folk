  "merged_caption": "In this abstract scene, a bright cyan light source is positioned at the top center against a dark, deep-blue background. Numerous small, glowing blue particles continuously rise from the bottom of the frame and gather from both sides, moving toward this central light source. As they ascend, the particles twinkle, varying in brightness, and are accompanied by thin, vertical streaks of blue light that also move upward, creating a sense of a constant, dynamic flow toward the light. The particles and streaks appear to converge toward the bright cyan light, creating a mesmerizing upward movement. The camera remains completely static throughout the video, capturing the continuous, gentle cascade of blue light against the dark blue and black background.",

    "Subject": "This abstract animation features numerous small, glowing blue particles and thin, vertical streaks of blue light converging toward a bright, cyan-colored light source located at the top center of the scene. The particles, varying in brightness, create a sparkling effect as they rise against a dark, deep-blue background.",

    "Scene": "Against a dark blue and black background, a bright cyan light emanates from the top center of the scene. Numerous glowing, star-like particles and thin vertical streaks of light converge toward this source from the surrounding dark space. The particles, varying in brightness, drift upwards, creating a continuous, gentle cascade of blue light.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
