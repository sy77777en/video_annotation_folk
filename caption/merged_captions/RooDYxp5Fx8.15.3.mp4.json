  "merged_caption": "This video captures a dynamic scene of a Japanese street intersection on a bright, sunny day. The camera, in an eye-level, level-angle shot with deep focus, moves forward along a tiled sidewalk with a dark metal railing extending into the scene in the bottom left foreground, while panning to the left with some noticeable shaking. Vehicles, including a white minivan and a black sedan, travel from left to right on a wide road that stretches from the lower right foreground to the left midground, intersected by a white crosswalk. A large concrete overpass curves from the middle ground into the background on the right, contrasting with the natural landscape. In the center background, a hill covered in lush green trees is visible, with the roof of a traditional Japanese-style building and a stone lantern peeking through the foliage. A red traffic light hangs in the top left of the frame, while the sky, a vivid blue with scattered white clouds, fills the upper portion of the scene. The view from the clean, tiled sidewalk initially looks across the intersection towards the hillside, emphasizing the peaceful atmosphere and the harmonious blend of nature and infrastructure. Several cars are stopped or moving slowly through the intersection, which is lined with orange traffic cones. The camera smoothly advances forward, capturing a dynamic view of the street corner, effectively showcasing various road facilities and enhancing the vibrant atmosphere.",

    "Camera": "This is an eye-level, level-angle shot with a deep focus, keeping the entire street scene sharp. The camera pans left while moving forward along the sidewalk, with some noticeable shaking.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a tranquil urban scenery shot of a Japanese street corner. The view from a clean, tiled sidewalk initially looks across an intersection towards a hillside covered in lush, green trees, with the roof of a traditional building peeking through the foliage. A large, modern concrete overpass curves across the right side of the frame and contrasting with the natural landscape. The shot lacks a central subject, as the camera captures a wide perspective that gives equal weight to the road, the bridge, the trees, and the bright blue sky with fluffy clouds, focusing on the peaceful atmosphere and the harmonious blend of nature and infrastructure.",
    "Motion": "The camera smoothly advances forward while panning to the left, capturing a dynamic view of a street corner in Japan on a sunny day. The scene features a road with an overpass, moving vehicles, and a traditional building nestled among lush green trees. The bright blue sky with scattered white clouds enhances the vibrant atmosphere, while various road facilities are effectively showcased.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a street intersection in a Japanese city on a bright, sunny day. The sky is a vivid blue with scattered white clouds. To the right, a large concrete overpass curves across the scene. In the center, beyond the asphalt road marked with a white crosswalk, a small hill is covered in lush green trees, with a traditional Japanese-style building and a stone lantern visible at its base. The sidewalk in the foreground is paved with grey and yellow tactile tiles and is bordered by a dark metal railing. A red traffic light hangs overhead, and several cars, including a white minivan and a black sedan, are stopped or moving slowly through the intersection, which is lined with orange traffic cones.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
