  "merged_caption": "The video showcases a wide shot of a black sports car with prominent 'NOS' branding, drifting on an expansive asphalt track. Initially, the car is positioned in the center of the middle ground, with the camera capturing it from above. The camera, mounted on a drone, maintains an overhead-level view at a high angle, looking down with a varying Dutch angle due to camera rolling. As the car drifts, producing a large cloud of white smoke from its tires, it dynamically shifts to the right side of the foreground. The camera smoothly tracks the car from an aerial view, arcing from side to side with tilting and vertical movements to enhance excitement. The car continues to drift, maintaining its speed and trajectory, with the smoke trail following closely behind. The car's movement is smooth and controlled, demonstrating its drifting skills on the track. Eventually, the car moves to the right-center of the frame in the foreground, and finally settles in the right-center of the middle ground. The car's orientation shifts, revealing different angles of its sleek, aerodynamic design with visible modifications, such as a rear spoiler and racing decals. White smoke trails behind the car, expanding from the bottom right towards the center of the frame. The surrounding arid, rocky terrain forms the background, remaining static as the car maneuvers. The time of day is bright, likely midday, with clear skies casting strong sunlight over the scene. The camera starts above the car, adjusts to the subject's height in the middle of the video, and returns to an overhead position by the end, providing a clear view of the drifting action and the track's surface. The shot size remains wide throughout, ensuring the car and its movement remain the focal point against the open backdrop.",

    "Camera": "The video features an overhead-level camera at a high angle, looking down from above with a varying Dutch angle due to camera rolling. It maintains deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera, mounted on a drone, smoothly tracks a racing car from an aerial view, arcing from side to side with tilting and vertical movements to enhance excitement. The motion is quick and steady, with no shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video features a black sports car with prominent branding, including a large \"NOS\" logo on the side. The car has a sleek, aerodynamic design with visible modifications, such as a rear spoiler and racing decals. It is producing a significant amount of white smoke from its tires, indicating high-speed drifting. The car's dynamic movement and the smoke trail emphasize its speed and agility. The vehicle's orientation changes, showcasing its drifting capability on a wide, open track.",
    "Motion": "A black sports car with 'NOS' branding is seen drifting on a track, producing a large cloud of white smoke from its tires as it maneuvers through a turn. The car continues to drift, maintaining its speed and trajectory, with the smoke trail following closely behind. The car's movement is smooth and controlled, demonstrating its drifting skills on the track. The background shows a barren, desert-like landscape with a clear sky, and the track appears to be a wide, open area suitable for drifting.",
    "Scene": "The video, filmed by a drone, captures an outdoor setting on a dry, expansive asphalt track surrounded by arid, rocky terrain. The time of day is bright, likely midday, with clear skies casting strong sunlight over the scene. A car is prominently featured, drifting across the track, creating thick plumes of white smoke that trail behind it. The car is sleek, with a dark body and vibrant decals, including a notable logo on the side. The surrounding landscape is barren, with sandy hills in the background, emphasizing the desolate environment. The drone's perspective provides a dynamic view of the car's movement, highlighting the speed and precision of the drift against the stark, open backdrop.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
