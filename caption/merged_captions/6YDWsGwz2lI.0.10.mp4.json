  "merged_caption": "This wide shot of the cityscape initially frames an older, light-colored building on the left and a modern, reflective glass building on the right, both in the middle ground, flanking a narrow street that runs down the center-bottom of the frame into the background where another multi-story building is visible. A faint reflection of an interior scene is present across the entire frame in the foreground, suggesting it might be the interior of a train moving from left to right. The camera is positioned at a height equivalent to three floors, maintaining a level angle looking straight ahead, and employs a deep focus, ensuring a large depth of field where most elements are sharp. The camera slowly moves to the right, smoothly and steadily, with no shaking. This movement causes the older building on the left to gradually occupy less of the left side of the frame, while more of the modern building on the right is revealed and fills more of the right side. The street and the distant building, while maintaining their central perspective, shift towards the left of the frame as the camera continues its rightward movement. The street below is paved and appears empty, with a few streetlights and planters visible along its length. The overall lighting suggests an overcast day, casting a muted, somewhat desaturated tone over the scene. The focus is on the urban environment, the contrasting architectural styles, the imposing scale of the buildings, and the atmosphere of a quiet city canyon.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at an overhead level, approximately second-floor height, and maintains a level angle looking straight ahead. It employs a deep focus, ensuring a large depth of field where most elements are sharp. The camera movement is very smooth, with no shaking, as it moves steadily to the right.",
    "Subject": "This is a cityscape scenery shot, looking straight at a narrow, empty street flanked by towering buildings. On the left, an older, light-colored building with classical architectural details and numerous windows stretches into the distance. On the right, a modern structure with a reflective glass and steel facade dominates the view. There is no main subject; instead, the focus is on the urban environment, the contrasting architectural styles, the imposing scale of the buildings, and the atmosphere of a quiet city canyon.",
    "Motion": "The video shows a narrow street flanked by tall buildings on both sides, with the camera moving smoothly from left to right. The buildings on the left are older with a more classical architectural style, featuring detailed facades and smaller windows. The buildings on the right are modern with large glass windows, reflecting the surrounding cityscape. The street is empty, with no visible vehicles or pedestrians. As the camera continues to move, the perspective shifts slightly, revealing more of the building on the right.",
    "Scene": "The video presents an objective view looking straight at a narrow city street flanked by tall buildings. On the left, an older, light-colored stone or concrete building with classical architectural details, including repeating window patterns and decorative elements, lines the street. On the right, a modern building with a glass and metal facade reflects the surroundings. The street below is paved and appears empty, with a few streetlights and planters visible along its length. In the distance, at the end of the street, another multi-story building with numerous windows is visible. The overall lighting suggests an overcast day, casting a muted, somewhat desaturated tone over the scene. The camera slowly moves right, revealing more of the modern building. In the foreground of the frame, there is a reflection that appears to show an interior scene, where a door, a window, and several rows of lights can be faintly seen. This suggests it might be the interior of a train moving from left to right.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
