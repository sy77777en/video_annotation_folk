  "merged_caption": "The video captures an outdoor experimental setup with a slight forward camera movement and a subtle pan to the left towards the end. A large, white, fabric-covered structure is primarily located in the foreground and middle ground on the left side of the frame. In the right foreground is a tall wooden rig constructed from light-colored wooden planks, featuring a wide triangular base and a central vertical post with attached horizontal and diagonal braces. A system of black and yellow ropes, straps, and pulleys connects the two structures across the lower portion of the frame. On the white structure, a green pouch hangs in the upper left and a black pouch is situated lower down, both in the middle ground. A thin, red line connects the white structure to the wooden one across the center of the frame. The background, visible on the right, consists of a chain-link fence and a field of dry brush in the middle ground, with low hills visible in the distance under a cloudy sky. The primary action involves a small black ball rolling down a ramp on the wooden structure, initially moving from left to right before reversing direction and traveling back to the left. The large, white, fabric-covered object is already rippled and deformed, with no contact from the ball. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, using a deep focus to keep the entire outdoor scene sharp, and moves slightly forward before subtly panning left at the end of the video.",

    "Camera": "This smooth, hip-level shot uses a deep focus, keeping the entire outdoor scene sharp. The camera, positioned at a level angle, moves slightly forward before subtly panning left at the end of the video.",
    "Subject": "The video features an outdoor experimental setup. On the right, a tall, freestanding structure is constructed from light-colored wooden planks, featuring a wide triangular base and a central vertical post with attached horizontal and diagonal braces. A small, black, spherical ball rolls down this wooden structure. To the left stands a large, rectangular object completely covered in a white, canvas-like fabric. Various pieces of equipment are attached to the side of this white structure, including a green pouch hanging from a carabiner near the top, a black pouch positioned lower down, and an assortment of black and yellow ropes and straps.",

    "Scene": "An outdoor scene is set in a dry, open area with dirt and asphalt ground. In the middle ground, a chain-link fence separates the area from a field of dry brush, with low hills visible in the distance under a cloudy sky. In the left foreground and middle ground, a large, white, fabric-covered rectangular structure stands next to a tall, freestanding wooden rig made of light-colored lumber in the right foreground. A system of black and yellow ropes, straps, and pulleys connects the two structures. A green bag hangs from the side of the white structure, attached with a carabiner, while a black bag is attached with a rope. An ordinary red rope connects the white wall and the wooden rig.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
