  "merged_caption": "In a medium close-up shot, a young man with light skin and short, black, tousled hair featuring a prominent light blue streak above his left eye is positioned in the center-right of the frame, occupying the foreground. He wears a red and black striped sweater and a gold-colored chain necklace. The background, composed of a soft, blurry blue sky and green and brown leaves, fills the entire space behind him, captured in cool, diffused light characteristic of twilight or an overcast day. The scene employs a Dolly Zoom effect, where the camera moves forward while zooming out, creating a distinctive visual impact. The slightly unsteady, eye-level shot with a level angle uses an extremely shallow depth of field to keep the person in the foreground in sharp focus, rendering the natural environment behind him as a smooth, out-of-focus backdrop. The young man gazes into the camera, initially with his head slightly lowered before returning to a neutral position, maintaining a fixed pose throughout the video.",

    "Scene": "In an outdoor setting with a soft, blurry background of a blue sky and green and brown leaves, a person is seen in the foreground. The scene is captured in cool, diffused light, characteristic of twilight or an overcast day. The individual has black hair with a blue streak on their forehead and wears a red and black striped shirt with a thin gold chain around their neck. The extreme shallow depth of field keeps the focus entirely on the person, rendering the natural environment behind them as a smooth, out-of-focus backdrop.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
