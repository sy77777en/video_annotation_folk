  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a worm's-eye view shot, framing a child with short, dark hair in the bottom left foreground, wearing a purple long-sleeved shirt and blue pants, and a full shot of a black and tan German Shepherd suspended mid-air in the center of the frame. A vertical pole effect bisects the center of the frame, appearing more like a visual effect than a physical object. In the middleground and background, several red rectangular objects with black-and-white patterns are visible on the white walls, while a staircase can later be seen occupying the middle ground in the center. The environment is dimly lit, giving the grainy footage a greenish-yellow color cast. The camera, captured with an unsteady, shaky motion, begins at a hip-level, worm’s-eye angle and cranes upward in an arc, gradually revealing more perspectives of the dog and the child, who stands with both arms raised toward the dog, as if assisting or spotting the animal. This movement causes the framing to expand into a full shot that captures both the child on the left and the dog in the center. The camera transitions from a worm's-eye angle to a relatively level angle, shifting from below the dog to at the dog's level, maintaining a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. The video is presented within a black frame overlay.",

    "Camera": "This video is captured with an unsteady, shaky camera that begins at a hip-level, worm’s-eye angle. The camera then cranes upward in an arc, effectively revealing more details of the dog as it is suspended in mid-air, and transitions to an eye-level, level angle. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "A black and tan German Shepherd is shown in a horizontal orientation, suspended in mid-air and remaining still. A visual effect creates the appearance of a pole that vertically divides the frame in the middle. Positioned to the left of the dog is a child with short, dark hair, wearing a purple long-sleeved shirt and blue pants. The child stands with both arms raised toward the dog, as if assisting or spotting the animal.",
    "Motion": "A black and tan German Shepherd appears suspended in mid-air, oriented horizontally, while all figures remain completely still. The camera cranes upward in an arc from a worm's-eye view, gradually revealing more perspectives of the dog and the person with raised arms. The pole seems more like a visual effect than a physical object.",
    "Scene": "This indoor scene takes place in a room with white walls and a staircase visible in the background. A vertical pole, appearing as a visual effect, divides the frame in the middle. A dog is stationary near the pole, while a person in a purple garment stands to the left with arms raised. The environment is dimly lit, giving the grainy footage a greenish-yellow color cast. Several red rectangular objects with black-and-white patterns are affixed to the walls. The video is presented within a black frame overlay.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
