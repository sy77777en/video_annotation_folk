  "merged_caption": "This is a wide, fixed point-of-view shot from a camera positioned just above and behind a racing driver's head, capturing a light blue and silver open-wheel formula-style race car. The front half of the car and the driver's helmet and hands occupy the bottom half of the frame in the foreground. The driver, wearing a black helmet, a white racing suit, and black and white gloves with red and black wristbands, grips the steering wheel. The paved racetrack extends from the foreground into the middle ground, curving to the right. In the middle ground, a bright green race car is positioned slightly to the right of center, with another dark-colored car visible nearby. The track is flanked by green grass that extends from the foreground to the background, while rolling hills and an overcast sky occupy the background and the top of the frame. The camera, exhibiting mild barrel distortion, maintains a deep focus, keeping the track and the surrounding landscape sharp. As the car moves forward, the track and surrounding landscape rush toward the camera and flow outward from the center, while the POV car remains stationary within the frame. The camera moves forward and pans right, following the car's path as it navigates a long, sweeping right-hand turn on the racetrack. The front of the blue car, featuring a white \"GoPro\" logo, and the driver's hands on the steering wheel inside the cockpit are visible in the foreground. In the distance ahead on the track, the bright green race car and another, more distant dark-colored car also travel in the same direction along the curve.",

    "Camera": "This is a high-angle, eye-level locked-on point-of-view shot from a race car, exhibiting mild barrel distortion. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the track and the surrounding landscape sharp. With some slight unsteadiness, the camera moves forward and pans right, following the car's path as it navigates a turn on the racetrack.",
    "Subject": "This is a fixed point-of-view shot from a light blue and silver open-wheel formula-style race car. The car's bodywork features a white \"GoPro\" logo in front of the open cockpit, and its black wheels and front suspension are visible on either side. Inside the cockpit, a driver is seated, seen from behind. They are wearing a black helmet, a white racing suit, and black and white gloves, with red and black wristbands tied around their arms outside the suit. Their hands are gripping the steering wheel. In the distance ahead on the track, a bright green race car and another, more distant dark-colored car are also visible.",
    "Motion": "From a locked-on view, a light blue race car drives forward on a paved track, steering through a long, sweeping right-hand turn. Ahead on the track, a green race car and another, more distant car also travel in the same direction along the curve.",
    "Scene": "A locked-on POV shot from a camera mounted on the top of the driver's helmet shows a light blue, open-wheel race car speeding along a paved racetrack. The track curves to the right, bordered by a dirt shoulder and an expansive plain with green grass, while green, rolling hills are visible in the far distance under an overcast sky. In the distance, other race cars, including a bright green one, can be seen ahead on the course. The front of the blue car, featuring a white \"GoPro\" logo, and the driver's hands on the steering wheel inside the cockpit are visible in the foreground.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
