  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot filmed at the subjects' level, a man, wearing a black jacket with white stripes on the sleeves, black leggings, black sneakers, and a grey baseball cap, is initially positioned in the center-middle ground, balanced on the handrails of two parallel moving walkways that extend from the right side of the frame. The scene is set inside a brightly lit, modern airport terminal with a high, tiled ceiling and a polished, reflective floor. A glass-and-metal moving walkway runs through the center of the spacious hall. The slightly unsteady camera tracks the man from the side, moving rightward as he performs parkour on the moving walkway. He glides forward through the terminal by riding the inner handrails, placing one foot on each. A woman with long, dark hair, wearing a beige jacket, stands on the right walkway, positioned in the middle ground, traveling with it. The man moves from left to right across the frame, performing an acrobatic jump over a metal divider located in the center of the walkways. He then leaps into the air, executing a front flip over the stationary central divider. After completing the flip, he lands on his feet on the polished floor in the center middle ground, where two other women are visible. One woman, with dark, curly hair, wearing a black and white patterned coat, pulls a purple suitcase, while a blonde woman stands nearby. The camera maintains an eye-level, level-angle shot with a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. In the middle ground, a plain white wall features a grey door, and rows of airport seating are visible near large windows. A few travelers are scattered throughout the area, with one person standing on the moving walkway and another with a luggage cart positioned at the end of the walkway.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
