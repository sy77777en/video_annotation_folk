  "merged_caption": "From a first-person perspective at eye-level, a weapon with a digital display indicating ammunition count is consistently held in the foreground, positioned at the bottom center of the frame. Initially, a large, light-colored concrete wall occupies the middle ground, stretching from the center to the right side of the frame. An opening to the left of this wall reveals a brighter outdoor area with green foliage and rocky terrain in the background. The player, holding a weapon, moves cautiously along the concrete wall, with the environment showing a mix of natural elements like trees and man-made structures. The camera, representing the player's view, moves slightly forward, then pans right, and finally moves forward again, with noticeable shaking. On-screen overlays include a mini-map with icons and text names in the bottom-left corner, a blue rectangular display with numerical data in the bottom-right corner, and red diamond-shaped icons with letters, superimposed on the walls and in the distant view. The view pans slightly to the right, causing the concrete wall to shift more centrally and the left opening to move further towards the left edge of the frame. As the view continues panning to the right, a metal stairway becomes visible in the middle ground at the center, along with a tank and a distant structure in the background. The setting includes multiple trees and a tank in the background, indicating an outdoor, possibly military-themed scenario. The overall scene is characterized by a mix of natural and man-made elements, with a focus on navigation and interaction within the game environment. The camera maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field throughout.",

    "Camera": "This first-person perspective video is shot from an eye-level, level angle. The camera, representing the player's view, moves slightly forward, then pans right, and finally moves forward again. The movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking. The camera maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field throughout.",
    "Subject": "The video features a first-person perspective from a video game, showcasing a virtual environment with a focus on a concrete building and a metal staircase. The player's view includes a weapon with a digital display indicating ammunition count. On-screen graphics display a map and various game-related icons, suggesting objectives or player positions. The setting includes multiple trees and a tank in the background, indicating an outdoor, possibly military-themed scenario. The overall scene is characterized by a mix of natural and man-made elements, with a focus on navigation and interaction within the game environment.",
    "Motion": "The player, holding a weapon, moves cautiously along a concrete wall, with the environment showing a mix of natural elements like trees and man-made structures. The player initially moves forward and then turns to the right, approaching a metal staircase. The tank and other military items become more prominent in the background.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, depicts an outdoor urban setting during daytime. The scene is characterized by light-colored, blocky buildings; one such building has a small, dark, square window, and a nearby wall section is rough-textured and a combination of white and light brown. A dark-colored firearm is held in the foreground. In the distance, visible through a gap between structures, a brighter area contains green foliage and rocky terrain. The perspective shifts slightly. Overlay elements include a mini-map with icons and text names in the bottom-left corner, a blue rectangular display with numerical data in the bottom-right corner, and red diamond-shaped icons with letters, superimposed on the walls and in the distant view.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
