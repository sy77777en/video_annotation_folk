  "merged_caption": "From a level-angle perspective, the camera is focused on a black, circular hockey puck with a white logo and lettering in the bottom-center foreground, with the curved black blade of a hockey stick positioned to its right. A full shot of a hockey player, who appears to be a woman, occupies the center of the frame in the middle ground, skating forward. She is wearing a red long-sleeved jersey, dark blue hockey pants with large white knee pads, and a white helmet. The camera, mounted on a hockey puck, tracks the player from the front, moving backward across the ice, maintaining the player's size in the frame. The camera performs a slight pan to the right and then to the left to follow the player as she skillfully moves the puck back and forth with the blade of her stick. The background is filled by the indoor rink, with green boards and protective netting spanning the lower half and a high, arched ceiling with exposed metal beams, numerous long, rectangular light fixtures, and small decorative banners occupying the top portion of the frame. A few blurry water droplets are visible on the camera surface in the foreground, particularly in the top right. The camera is positioned slightly above the puck at the player's foot level, and a mild barrel distortion lens creates a wide, curved effect of the scene. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The use of a mild barrel distortion lens gives the entire scene a slightly wide and curved appearance. The scene unfolds inside an indoor ice hockey rink, and the camera continuously tracks the player as they skate forward, stickhandling the puck.",

    "Camera": "This ground-level, level-angle shot features mild barrel distortion. Mounted on a hockey puck, the slightly unsteady camera tracks a hockey player from the front, moving backward across the ice. The camera performs a slight pan to the right and then to the left to follow the player. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "From a level perspective on an ice rink, a black, circular hockey puck with a white logo and lettering sits in the immediate foreground. Positioned directly beside the puck is the curved black blade of a hockey stick. A hockey player, who appears to be a woman, stands on skates, looking forward. She is wearing a red long-sleeved jersey, dark blue hockey pants with large white knee pads, and a white helmet. She holds the hockey stick, which extends from her gloved hands down to the ice.",
    "Motion": "From a level, on-ice perspective, a hockey player skates forward, stickhandling a puck. The camera continuously tracks the player as they skillfully move the puck back and forth with the blade of their stick.",
    "Scene": "From a locked-on POV shot where the camera is mounted to an object on the ice, the scene unfolds inside an indoor ice hockey rink. In the immediate foreground, a black, textured hockey puck and the curved black blade of a hockey stick are visible on the white ice surface. A person wearing a red jersey, dark pants with white knee pads, and a helmet skates toward the camera's level perspective. The rink is enclosed by green boards and protective netting. Overhead, a high, arched ceiling with exposed metal beams is lit by numerous long, rectangular light fixtures, and small decorative banners hang from the structure. The use of a mild barrel distortion lens gives the entire scene a slightly wide and curved appearance.",
    "Spatial": "From a level-angle perspective, the camera is focused on a hockey puck in the bottom-center foreground, with the blade of a hockey stick positioned to its right.

The background is filled by the indoor rink, with green boards and netting spanning the lower half and a high, arched ceiling with lights and banners occupying the top portion of the frame.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
