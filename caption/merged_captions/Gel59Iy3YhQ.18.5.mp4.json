  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot from a high angle, showing a woman standing inside an open garage. A white goose with a bright orange beak and orange webbed feet, depicted in a simplified, low-polygon art style, is positioned at the bottom center of the frame, just outside the garage. The woman, seen from behind, shares this stylized aesthetic; she has a pear-shaped body and is dressed in a maroon top, brown pants, and black shoes, holding an orange object in her left hand. As the garage door closes from the top of the frame downwards, obscuring the woman, the camera rapidly zooms out, transitioning into a wider shot. The camera dynamically tracks the goose, which remains central in the frame, as it turns and walks away from the closed door, moving across a paved area. The now-closed garage and its building, featuring a white-trimmed window and a light-yellow garage door, occupy the upper-center portion of the scene. This camera movement reveals more of the surroundings: a fruit stand with geometrically shaped produce under a green awning appears on the left, a classic red British pillar box enters the bottom-right, an A-frame sign displaying a white circle containing a black silhouette of a goose with a red line through it is visible in the bottom-left, and a metal gate appears on the right side of the frame. The scene is set on a paved street in a stylized, cartoonish town during the day, with a small patch of green lawn and a hedge to the right of the garage. The overhead, high-angle shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp, and employs rapid zoom-ins and zoom-outs to enhance the energetic feel of the gameplay.",

    "Subject": "A white goose with a bright orange beak and orange webbed feet is depicted in a simplified, low-polygon art style. It has a smooth, untextured body and small black dots for eyes. A woman, seen from behind, shares this stylized aesthetic; she has a pear-shaped body and is dressed in a maroon top, brown pants, and black shoes. Her form is minimalistic, with no discernible facial features and simple cylindrical arms. Other objects, such as a classic red British pillar box and a fruit stand with geometrically shaped produce, are also rendered in the same flat-shaded, cartoon-like style. A black A-frame sign displays a white circle containing a black silhouette of a goose with a red line through it.",
    "Motion": "A woman is holding an orange object in her left hand and uses her right hand to close the garage door, leaving the goose outside. The goose then turns and walks away from the closed door, moving across a paved area.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set on a paved street in a stylized, cartoonish town during the day. A central red brick building features a white-trimmed window and a light-yellow garage door, which is initially open before closing as the view pulls back to reveal more of the surroundings. A white goose with an orange beak and feet walks on the pavement in front of the building. To the left of the garage is a small market stall under a green awning, displaying crates of produce. To the right, the street includes a red postbox, a small patch of green lawn with a hedge, and a metal gate.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
