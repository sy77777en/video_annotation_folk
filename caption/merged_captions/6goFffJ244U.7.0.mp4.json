  "merged_caption": "The video showcases an abstract scene with numerous glowing, circular light patterns against a dark background. These circles vary in size and intensity, predominantly in warm tones like gold and amber. They are distributed throughout the frame, with some positioned in the foreground, creating a sense of depth, while others recede into the middle ground and background. The lights overlap and move fluidly, drifting from one side to another, often from the bottom left to the top right, or vice versa, enhancing the dynamic nature of the scene. The camera maintains a consistent view of the shimmering orbs as they float and shift positions, creating a lively and vibrant visual effect. The video features a completely static camera with no movement or shaking, while small artificial lights intermittently appear in the frame, creating vibrant, out-of-focus dots. The circles overlap and move smoothly across the frame, creating a shimmering effect as they interact with each other. The overall motion is abstract, focusing on the dynamic interplay of light and color. The scene presents an abstract, dynamic display of glowing orbs against a dark background. These orbs vary in size and intensity, with colors ranging from warm yellows to deep oranges, creating a vibrant and lively atmosphere. The orbs appear to float and move gently, suggesting a sense of depth and motion. The overall effect is reminiscent of a festive or celebratory setting, with the glowing elements resembling lights or reflections. The dark backdrop enhances the brightness and color of the orbs, making them stand out prominently in the scene. The overall visual is abstract, with no discernible objects or figures, focusing solely on the interplay of light and color.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
