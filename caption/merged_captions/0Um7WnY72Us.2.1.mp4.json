  "merged_caption": "In a dimly lit indoor setting, a light-skinned adult man with dark, shaggy hair and some facial stubble is seated shirtless in a white, high-backed chair. He is positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground of the scene, wearing a complex headpiece made of wires and small, glowing lights. The headgear features blue lights on top and a row of red lights across his forehead, which serve as the primary source of illumination, casting the rest of the scene in deep shadow. Various black cables and wires are visible around the chair, with one black cable extending from the left side of the frame in the foreground toward the middle ground. The surrounding dark environment and wires occupy the background, where a red light and shadows cast through the window enhance the mysterious ambiance. The camera captures this in a slightly unsteady, low-angle shot from hip level, with a shallow depth of field focused on the man in the midground. Initially static, the camera tilts upward as the man, seated and hunched over, slowly leans further forward, bowing his head down. He then extends his arms to the sides and uses them to support his body as he lifts himself up.",

    "Scene": "In a dimly lit indoor setting, a shirtless man is seated in a white, high-backed chair. He wears a complex headpiece constructed from a tangle of wires, which features glowing blue lights on top and a row of red lights across his forehead. Various black cables and wires are visible around the chair, connecting to the surrounding dark environment. The primary source of light comes from the headgear, illuminating the man's upper body and casting the rest of the scene in deep shadow. In the background, a red light and shadows cast through the window enhance the mysterious ambiance of the scene.",
    "Spatial": "In a medium shot, a man is positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground of the scene, seated in a high-backed chair. A black cable is visible on the left side of the frame, extending from the foreground toward the middle ground. The surrounding dark environment and various wires occupy the background. The camera, initially stationary but slightly unsteady, tilts upward as the man, seated and hunched over, slowly leans further forward, bowing his head down.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
