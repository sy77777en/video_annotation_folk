  "merged_caption": "In this medium shot, filmed at the subject's level, a shirtless man with a light skin tone and a muscular back is initially positioned from behind in the center-right foreground. He is wearing dark blue pants and a red cap, with short dark hair visible underneath. A prominent red mark or rash is apparent on the right side of his back. A green football field occupies the lower middle ground, with blurred stadium bleachers in the background, set outdoors on a bright, sunny day at a football stadium. A brown leather American football with white laces is visible in the left foreground, near the man. The video features a speed ramp effect, shifting between fast and slow playback. The camera is static, positioned at eye level with a level angle, employing a shallow depth of field to keep the foreground in focus. The football, initially close to the man's back, bounces off his body and gradually moves leftward, eventually exiting the frame on the left. The man remains stationary, with his posture slightly shifting as the football moves out of the frame. As the football disappears, the man begins to turn to his right, seemingly reacting to pain, and his position shifts from center-right to the far right of the frame. The background shows an empty stadium with green grass and empty seats, suggesting a practice or training session.",

    "Subject": "The video features a shirtless man with a light skin tone and a muscular back, viewed from behind. He is wearing dark blue pants and a red cap, with short dark hair visible underneath. A prominent red mark or rash is apparent on the right side of his back. Positioned to the left of the man and slightly behind him is a brown leather American football with white laces, seemingly flying away from the man.",

    "Scene": "The scene is set outdoors on a bright, sunny day at a football stadium. A green grass field extends from the middle ground to the background, while rows of empty, grey bleachers blur into the distance. A brown leather football with white laces, oval in shape, is visible in mid-air behind a shirtless individual whose back is to the camera. A noticeable red mark is present on the person's back.",
    "Spatial": "In this medium shot, filmed at the subject's level, a shirtless man is initially positioned from behind in the center-right foreground. A green football field occupies the lower middle ground, with blurred stadium bleachers in the background. A brown American football is visible in the left foreground, near the man. The football gradually moves leftward and eventually exits the frame on the left. Concurrently, the man slightly turns his upper body to the right, and his position shifts from center-right to the far right of the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
