  "merged_caption": "From an over-the-shoulder perspective, the camera captures a close-up shot from a high angle, looking down at the scene. The subject's arm and shoulder occupy the right foreground of the frame. Positioned in the center middle ground is a rectangular wooden box, angled from the top right towards the bottom left. The box, made of dark wood with brass hinges, has a reddish-brown felt-lined interior. A sketchbook with a drawing of a full face is partially visible beneath the box, while a container of crayons sits in the top left background. The camera uses a shallow depth of field to focus on the wooden box in the midground and performs a slow, smooth zoom-in on the box. The subject, wearing a striped tan and grey long-sleeved shirt, lifts the lid of the box. Their right hand enters from the right middle ground, after opening the box lid, to reach into the box to touch the telescope resting inside. The telescope is long and cylindrical, wrapped in dark brown leather, featuring a decorative chain-like stitch running along its length, and is capped with brass-colored metal on its ends. The person's hand reaches out to touch the end of the telescope where the eyepiece is located. The camera remains static throughout the entire shot, featuring a subtle zoom-in effect.",

    "Camera": "From a high, eye-level angle, this shot uses a shallow depth of field to focus on a wooden box in the midground. The camera performs a slow, smooth zoom-in on the box as a person's hands reach for the telescope nestled inside.",
    "Subject": "From an over-the-shoulder perspective, a person wearing a striped tan and grey long-sleeved shirt opens a rectangular wooden box.

    "Motion": "From an over-the-shoulder perspective, a person lifts the lid of a wooden box. Their right hand then reaches into the box and touches the end of the telescope where the eyepiece is located.",
    "Scene": "From an over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind the character, showing only their left arm and the scene ahead, a person opens a rectangular wooden box resting on a desk. The interior of the box is lined with red fabric and holds a vintage telescope wrapped in dark, stitched leather with brass-colored metal ends. Next to the box, a sketchbook with a drawing of a full face is visible, and a container of crayons sits in the background. The person's hand lifts the lid and then reaches in to touch the telescope.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
