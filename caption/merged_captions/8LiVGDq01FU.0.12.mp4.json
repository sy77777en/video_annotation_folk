  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a man in a dark, bulky spacesuit with a helmet that has a clear visor, positioned slightly to the right of center in the foreground. His face is visible, showing a focused expression. The environment features tall, dark, vertically ribbed walls or structures with a somewhat metallic appearance, dominating the background, particularly noticeable on the left and center. The lighting highlights the contours of his suit and helmet, emphasizing the technical and protective nature of his attire. The video features a low camera angle with a varying Dutch angle due to camera rolling. It employs an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the midground. As the shot transitions smoothly into a medium close-up, the man's helmeted head and upper torso are brought closer to the viewer, while he remains slightly to the right of center in the foreground. During this transition, the man slightly lowers his head, gradually shifting his focused gaze downward, maintaining his position with a steady expression. The camera moves smoothly forward and upward, maintaining minimal shaking. The background structures remain visible but are less encompassing due to the tighter framing, and the camera stays level with the subject throughout. The man is oriented sideways, appearing to be in a confined or narrow space, possibly maneuvering or inspecting something. The background remains consistent, with the vertical structures and dim lighting providing a sense of a confined or narrow space. An astronaut in a white and grey helmet and suit is visible in the foreground, partially lit, contrasting with the surrounding shadows. The man remains facing to the left, with his suit and helmet clearly visible.",

    "Camera": "The video features a low camera angle with a varying Dutch angle due to camera rolling. It employs an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the midground. The camera moves smoothly forward and upward, maintaining minimal shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video features a man wearing a dark, bulky spacesuit with a helmet that has a clear visor. His face is visible, showing a focused expression. The suit includes a backpack-like apparatus, suggesting space exploration or a similar environment. The man is oriented sideways, appearing to be in a confined or narrow space, possibly maneuvering or inspecting something. The lighting highlights the contours of his suit and helmet, emphasizing the technical and protective nature of his attire.",
    "Motion": "The man, dressed in a dark, bulky spacesuit with a helmet, is seen in a dimly lit environment with vertical structures in the background. His head and body face the left of the frame as he gradually shifts his focused gaze downward, maintaining his position with a steady expression. The background remains consistent, with the vertical structures and dim lighting providing a sense of a confined or narrow space. The man remains facing to the left, with his suit and helmet clearly visible.",
    "Scene": "The video shows an indoor setting with low-key lighting. The environment features tall, dark, vertically ribbed walls or structures that dominate the background. These structures have a somewhat metallic appearance. An astronaut in a white and grey helmet and suit is visible in the foreground, partially lit, contrasting with the surrounding shadows.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium shot of a man in a spacesuit, positioned slightly to the right of center in the foreground.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
