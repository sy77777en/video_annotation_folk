  "merged_caption": "This extreme wide shot, filmed from a tilted overhead isometric perspective, initially shows a male video game character centered in the frame. The character has a pixelated, low-resolution appearance and wears a red and black top with white long sleeves, dark pants, and red boots, holding a round shield in his left hand. To his left is a small, rustic hut with a thatched roof and log walls, while a user interface occupies the bottom of the screen, featuring a large red orb on the left, a large blue orb on the right, and a central bar with icons. The scene is set at night in a gloomy, rural landscape with dark green and brown terrain crisscrossed by dark red paths. As the character walks along a dirt path toward a larger stone building with a rounded wall and a glowing red entrance in the upper right, a red, glowing trail appears on the ground, reflecting the red light emanating from the building's illuminated doorway. The character proceeds to follow this path toward the entrance. The camera moves up and trucks right to follow the character's movement, maintaining its isometric view throughout the shot, and pauses when the character stands still. Low, broken stone walls and gnarled trees are scattered throughout the area, and as the character advances, the shimmering red trail materializes on the ground, leading the way to the entrance. The camera's smooth, aerial perspective in the 2.5D game ensures the character remains centered in the frame as he moves towards the top right, with the larger stone building coming into view.",

    "Scene": "A third-person isometric (2.5D) gaming video with a tilted overhead angle shows the environment in a three-quarters perspective. The scene is set at night in a gloomy, rural landscape with dark green and brown terrain crisscrossed by dark red paths. A small, rustic hut with a thatched roof and log walls stands on the left, while low, broken stone walls and gnarled trees are scattered throughout the area. As a character walks across the screen, a larger stone building with a rounded wall and a glowing red entrance becomes visible in the upper right. A shimmering red trail materializes on the ground, leading the way to this entrance. An overlay at the bottom of the screen displays a user interface with a red orb on the left, a blue orb on the right, an inventory/equipment bar in the middle, and several labeled buttons positioned at the far sides.",
    "Spatial": "This extreme wide shot, filmed from a tilted overhead isometric perspective, initially shows a male video game character centered in the frame. To his left is a small hut, while a user interface occupies the bottom of the screen. The character walks towards the top right while remaining centered in the frame, and as he moves, a glowing red path materializes on the ground before him, leading towards a larger stone building that comes into view in the top right. The camera moves up and trucks right to follow the character's movement, maintaining its isometric view throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
