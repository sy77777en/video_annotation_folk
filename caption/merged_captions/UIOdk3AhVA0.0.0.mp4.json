  "merged_caption": "This full shot centers on a man snowboarding in the foreground, captured at their level, wearing a black and grey patterned snow jacket with the hood pushed up by his backpack, a pink beanie, black snow pants, black gloves, and a black backpack. His face is partially covered by large ski goggles with orange-tinted lenses, and his mouth is open. The video is captured from a low-angle, eye-level perspective, maintaining a deep focus. As the snowboarder carves down a vast, snow-covered mountain during the daytime under a clear blue sky, the camera moves backward and down to lead him from the front, keeping him centered in the frame. He passes through a large cloud of powder, consistently moving forward with slight turns while looking at the camera. A large plume of snow floats in the foreground, occupying the right side of the frame and flying away from the camera toward the midground as the snowboarder moves across it. In the middleground, another person is visible on a snowboard, also descending the slope and crossing through the spray of snow. In the background, rocky peaks emerge from the deep snow, positioned on both sides, with the bright sun visible. Another person on a snowboard is briefly visible further up the slope.",

    "Camera": "This video is captured from a low-angle, eye-level perspective. The camera maintains a deep focus, moving backward and down to lead a snowboarder from the front as they ride through the snow.",
    "Subject": "The main subject is a man snowboarding, seen from a full shot as he looks toward the camera. He wears a black and grey patterned snow jacket with the hood pushed up by his backpack, a pink beanie, black snow pants, black gloves, and a black backpack. His face is partially covered by large ski goggles with orange-tinted lenses, and his mouth is open. He is passing through a large spray of snow.

    "Motion": "A snowboarder carves down a snowy mountain, passing through a large cloud of powder as he consistently moves forward with slight turns while looking at the camera. In the middleground, a second snowboarder also descends the slope, crossing through the spray of snow.",
    "Scene": "A selfie POV shot captures a person snowboarding down a vast, snow-covered mountain. The scene is set during the daytime under a clear blue sky, with the bright sun visible. In the background, rocky peaks emerge from the deep snow. As the snowboarder moves, they kick up a large plume of white powder snow, which billows around them. Another person on a snowboard is briefly visible further up the slope.",
    "Spatial": "This full shot centers on a snowboarder in the foreground, captured at their level. As the snowboarder moves, the camera moves with them, keeping them centered in the frame. A large plume of snow is floating in the foreground, occupying the right side of the frame and flying away from the camera toward the midground as the people move across it. In the background, snow-covered mountains are positioned on both sides. A second person on a snowboard is visible in the right middle ground."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
