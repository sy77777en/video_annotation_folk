  "merged_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of a man with short hair, wearing a light-colored sleeveless shirt, capturing him from the thigh up. Initially, he is positioned slightly to the right of center, leaning against a wall in the middle ground of an outdoor setting viewed through a large, dusty glass window. His body is angled slightly towards the right, with his head resting on the wall. The environment appears to be an open, possibly abandoned area with concrete structures visible in the background, and the time of day is likely daytime, as natural light illuminates the scene. The glass is marked with dirt and grime, adding a textured, aged appearance. The man supports himself with his left hand on the wall while covering his chest with his right hand, lowering his head and coughing, indicating fatigue. Gradually, he shifts to supporting the wall with both hands before turning his body towards the camera. As he moves from a leaning position to a more upright stance, he lowers his right hand, further suggesting that he appears very tired. Throughout the sequence, the man remains in the middle ground, while the foreground features the large, dusty glass window. The background includes concrete structures and a few indistinct figures further back. The camera is at eye level and maintains a level angle, focusing on the man in the midground with a shallow depth of field. It moves forward smoothly with minimal shaking, keeping the man consistently slightly to the right of center as he moves. The overall spatial dynamics highlight the man's gradual shift in posture and orientation, suggesting a moment of fatigue. Neutral tones dominate the visual palette, enhancing the scene's somber mood.",

    "Motion": "The video shows a man standing outside a building, leaning against a wall with his head down. Initially, he supports himself with his left hand on the wall while covering his chest with his right hand. He lowers his head and coughs, indicating fatigue.

    "Scene": "The video depicts an outdoor setting viewed through a large, dusty glass window, creating a barrier between the viewer and the scene. The environment appears to be an open, possibly abandoned area with concrete structures visible in the background. The time of day is likely daytime, as natural light illuminates the scene. The glass is marked with dirt and grime, adding a textured, aged appearance. A person is visible through the glass, leaning against the wall and coughing while holding their chest. In the background, a few indistinct figures can also be seen. Neutral tones dominate the visual palette.",
    "Spatial": "The video presents a medium shot of a man, capturing him from the thigh up. Initially, he is positioned slightly to the right of center, leaning against a wall in the middle ground. His body is angled slightly towards the right, with his head resting on the wall. As the video progresses, he shifts his posture, moving his head away from the wall and raising his upper body into a more upright stance. Throughout the sequence, the man remains in the middle ground, while the foreground features a large, dusty glass window. The background includes concrete structures and a few indistinct figures further back. The camera maintains a steady position at the subject's level, keeping the man consistently slightly to the right of center as he moves. The overall spatial dynamics highlight the man's gradual shift in posture."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
