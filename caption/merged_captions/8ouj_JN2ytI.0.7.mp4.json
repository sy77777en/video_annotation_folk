  "merged_caption": "A medium shot shows a silhouetted man in the foreground on the left side of the frame, standing inside a dark tunnel that frames the scene. The tunnel opening reveals a brightly lit football stadium in the background, visible in the center and right portions of the frame, with expansive stands filled with a dense crowd of spectators and a goalpost visible on the field. A single, long fluorescent light is mounted on the ceiling of the tunnel. The man, wearing a mask, initially gestures with his right hand toward the right side of the frame. A second silhouetted hand enters from the right foreground and places a small, rectangular object, possibly a phone, into his outstretched hand. The man then holds the object with both hands and manipulates it with his fingers. The camera remains static and is positioned at the subject's level, though it appears slightly unsteady, using a shallow depth of field to focus on the silhouetted person in the foreground.",

    "Camera": "This is a fixed, slightly unsteady shot from an eye-level, level angle. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, focusing on the silhouetted person in the foreground.",
    "Subject": "A silhouetted man, wearing a mask, stands in a dark tunnel looking to the right of the frame. Initially, he gestures with his hand, and then a silhouetted hand gives him an object, possibly a phone, which he begins to manipulate with his fingers.",
    "Motion": "A silhouetted man stands in a dark tunnel and gestures with his right hand. Another hand enters the frame from the right and places a small, rectangular object into his outstretched hand. The man then holds the object with both hands and manipulates it with his fingers.",
    "Scene": "From the dark, shadowy interior of a concrete tunnel, the view opens onto a brightly lit football stadium during the day. The expansive stands are filled with a dense crowd of spectators. A goalpost is visible on the field. A single, long fluorescent light is mounted on the ceiling of the tunnel. In the foreground, a person is seen in complete silhouette, standing within the tunnel and looking inside the tunnel to the right.",
    "Spatial": "A medium shot shows a silhouetted man in the foreground on the left side of the frame, standing inside a dark tunnel that frames the scene. The tunnel opening reveals a brightly lit football stadium in the background, visible in the center and right portions of the frame.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
