  "merged_caption": "This close-up shot centers on a man with dark, somewhat tousled hair, viewed from the back and slightly to his right, occupying the foreground. He is wearing a dark-colored, possibly black, crew-neck sweatshirt. His head is turned slightly to his right, and he appears to be looking downwards or to the side, with his face mostly obscured. The scene is set outdoors in a vast, open landscape under a pale sky, with hazy, purplish-blue mountains visible in the far background. The time of day appears to be dusk or dawn, with soft, low-angle light creating a noticeable lens flare or strong backlight that illuminates the back of the man's head. The overall color palette is muted, dominated by blues, grays, and browns, with the backlight introducing a bright, warm highlight. The man remains still as his hair moves gently in the wind. A prominent backlight or lens flare highlights the top left portion of the man's head. The camera is at eye level and a level angle, using an extremely shallow depth of field with the focus on the man in the foreground. The camera slowly and smoothly arcs counterclockwise, remaining static at the subject's level throughout the scene, as a vast, open landscape extends in front of him, with low-lying vegetation.",

    "Scene": "The scene is set outdoors in a vast, open landscape under a pale sky. In the distance, hazy, purplish-blue mountains are visible. The time of day appears to be dusk or dawn, with soft, low-angle light creating a noticeable lens flare or strong backlight that illuminates the back of a person's head. The person, with dark, somewhat messy hair and wearing a dark shirt, is seen from behind, looking out over the expansive terrain, which features low-lying vegetation. The overall color palette is muted, dominated by blues, grays, and browns, with the backlight introducing a bright, warm highlight.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
