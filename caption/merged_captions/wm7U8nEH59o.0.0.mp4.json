  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot filmed from inside a vehicle at night, the camera is mounted on the side of a car and moves left in sync with the car's motion, providing a side view of the passengers. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, focusing on the midground with a shallow depth of field, and the movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking. A man in a dark helmet with goggles and a dark jacket with light-colored accents is positioned in the middle ground on the left side of the frame, seen in profile. A second person, also in a similar helmet and jacket, occupies the foreground on the right, but is out of focus and heavily silhouetted, framing the shot. The interior is enveloped in dark, shadowy tones, with subtle highlights from ambient light sources outside casting a warm glow on the subjects in the front seats. Despite the darkness obscuring many features, the orange seatbelts stand out distinctly. The man on the left initially turns his head slightly to his left to face the driver and the camera as he speaks, revealing a focused expression, then shifts his gaze forward, towards the left side of the frame, while the driver continues to drive. The overall atmosphere is subdued, with minimal external details visible through the windows, focusing on the interior environment.",

    "Subject": "The video features two men seated side by side inside a vehicle, with the camera positioned to their left. The man further from the camera, on the left, is wearing a dark helmet with goggles and a dark jacket with light-colored accents. His face is partially illuminated, revealing a focused expression. The man closer to the camera, on the right, is also wearing a similar helmet and jacket, but his features are less visible due to being out of focus and the very dim lighting. Both men appear to be facing forward, suggesting they are either driving or riding in the vehicle, with the shadowy atmosphere adding to the scene's intensity.",
    "Motion": "The man in the passenger seat, wearing a dark helmet with goggles and a dark jacket with light-colored accents, turns his head to his left to face the driver and the camera. After speaking, he looks forward again, towards the left side of the frame, while the driver continues to drive.",
    "Scene": "The video captures a vehicle in motion at night, with an indoor setting characterized by dim lighting. The interior is enveloped in dark, shadowy tones, with subtle highlights from ambient light sources outside casting a warm glow on the subjects in the front seats. Despite the darkness obscuring many features, the orange seatbelts stand out distinctly. The lighting creates a contrast between the illuminated faces and the darker surroundings, emphasizing the confined space. The overall atmosphere is subdued, with minimal external details visible through the windows, focusing on the interior environment.",
    "Spatial": "In a medium shot filmed from inside a vehicle, a man in a helmet is positioned in the middle ground on the left side of the frame, seen in profile. A second person, also in a helmet, occupies the foreground on the right, but is out of focus and heavily silhouetted, framing the shot. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level. The man on the left initially turns his head slightly to his left as he speaks, then shifts his gaze forward, towards the left side of the frame, while the rest of the composition remains static."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
