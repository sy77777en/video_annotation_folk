  "merged_caption": "The shot captures a fixed point-of-view from underneath a moving skateboard, with the board's underside extending from the top of the foreground to the center of the middle ground. A small, black, cube-shaped action camera is mounted in the center of the middle ground, positioned between two off-white wheels that are visible at the center left and center right. The light-brown surface of a skate ramp stretches from the foreground into the background, rushing towards the camera and creating a motion-blurred effect. As the skateboard moves forward at high speed, following the curve of a smooth ramp, the ground blurs past as the wheels spin, conveying a sense of rapid motion along the curved path. The ramp's surface appears to move backward relative to the camera. In the background, the ramp curves upward against an overexposed white sky, with the top of a green tree briefly visible in the top right, suggesting a daytime setting. The skateboard remains static relative to the camera, while the smooth camera movement with minimal shaking enhances the dynamic effect. From a ground-level perspective, the camera is mounted underneath the skateboard, capturing its back wheels and another camera. The camera leads the action from the front, moving smoothly with minimal shaking as the skateboard arcs clockwise and downward through a skatepark pit. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp. The focus is on the underside of the skateboard deck, which features a worn graphic in blue, black, and yellow. Centrally mounted between the trucks is a small, black, cube-shaped action camera positioned with its lens facing the camera that is recording this video, and a small, illuminated blue light is visible on its front.",

    "Subject": "This video offers a fixed perspective from underneath a skateboard. The focus is on the underside of the skateboard deck, which features a worn graphic in blue, black, and yellow.

    "Motion": "From a fixed viewpoint underneath the skateboard, the board rolls forward at a high speed, following the curve of a smooth ramp. The ground blurs past as the wheels spin, conveying a sense of rapid motion along the curved path.",
    "Scene": "A locked-on POV shot from a camera mounted underneath a skateboard captures the view between two off-white front wheels as it speeds along a curved path. The worn, blue underside of the skateboard deck, featuring some yellow and white graphics, occupies the top of the view. The camera travels rapidly across the smooth, light-brown surface of an outdoor skate ramp, causing the ground to appear as a motion-blurred streak. In the background, the ramp's edge curves upward against a bright, overexposed white sky, with the top of a green tree visible in the distance, suggesting a daytime setting.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
