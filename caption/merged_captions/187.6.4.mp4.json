  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot focused on the front of a dark green Volvo sedan, located in the center of the frame and the middle ground, with a man with dark skin and a bald head visible in the driver's seat. A yellow beaded necklace hangs from the rearview mirror. The shot transitions by pulling back into a wide shot, revealing the entire car, which has a Finnish license plate reading \"UYZ-639,\" and several people within a dimly lit concrete underpass or parking garage. The car, with its yellow-tinted headlights on, remains in the center middle ground with all its doors open. The camera, filmed from a shaky, eye-level perspective, uses a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. It performs an unsteady zoom-out, pausing briefly before continuing with slight, intermittent zooms to reveal five people simultaneously getting out of the car. Three women exit from the passenger side: one wearing a light blue hijab and a light blue and green patterned t-shirt over a dark long-sleeved shirt, and another wearing a white head covering and a dark jacket. Two men exit from the driver's side doors, one in a dark jacket and dark pants with an orange pattern, and another man wearing a dark jacket. The wider framing shows concrete support pillars in the foreground and middle ground on the left and right, defining the space. The people move to stand beside the vehicle, moving into the dark, cavernous space defined by concrete walls and support pillars. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level throughout the shot, maintaining a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp.",

    "Camera": "Filmed from a shaky, eye-level perspective, the camera uses a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. It performs an unsteady zoom-out, pausing briefly before continuing with slight, intermittent zooms to reveal a group of people exiting a car in a parking garage.",
    "Subject": "In a dimly lit parking garage, a dark green Volvo sedan with yellow-tinted headlights and a Finnish license plate reading \"UYZ-639\" is parked with all its doors open. A man with dark skin and a bald head is visible in the driver's seat, and a yellow beaded necklace hangs from the rearview mirror. Several other people with dark skin are exiting the car. A woman wearing a light blue hijab and a light blue and green patterned t-shirt over a dark long-sleeved shirt gets out from the rear passenger side. Another woman, wearing a white head covering and a dark jacket, also exits from the passenger side. From the driver's side, a man in a dark jacket and dark pants with an orange pattern gets out, as does another man wearing a dark jacket.",
    "Motion": "The camera zooms out to reveal a stationary dark green Volvo in a dimly lit parking garage. Five people simultaneously get out of the car from the open doors. Three women exit from the passenger side, followed by two men from the driver's side doors.",
    "Scene": "In a dimly lit concrete underpass or parking garage, a dark green Volvo sedan is parked with its yellow-tinted headlights on. The vehicle, which has a license plate reading \"UYZ-639,\" is positioned centrally under sparse overhead lighting that creates a stark contrast with the surrounding shadows. Several people are exiting the car through its open doors, moving into the dark, cavernous space defined by concrete walls and support pillars.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium shot focused on the front of a dark green car, which is located in the center of the frame and the middle ground, with a man visible in the driver's seat. The shot then transitions by pulling back into a wide shot, revealing the entire car and several people within a concrete underpass. The car remains in the center middle ground with all its doors open as people exit from both the left and right sides, moving to stand beside the vehicle. The wider framing shows concrete support pillars in the foreground and middle ground on the left and right, defining the space. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
