  "merged_caption": "This is a close-up shot focusing on a woman with wavy, shoulder-length hair and a light skin tone, wearing glasses and a dark-colored jacket with a green trim, positioned slightly left of center in the foreground. Her expression is cheerful as she lifts her glasses upward with her left hand and smiles, suggesting she might be in a social setting. The background features a wall with red lights towards the top left and center, and a circular sign on the right, with a blurred sign and some indistinct objects adding to the cozy and intimate ambiance of the setting. The camera is at eye level and initially at a level angle, then shifts to a low angle, using a shallow depth of field to focus on the woman. It arcs around her in a counter-clockwise direction, then slightly arcs back, with the movement being slightly unsteady with some shaking. During the clip, the woman turns slightly to the right. The video captures an indoor setting, likely a dimly lit diner or bar, characterized by warm, ambient lighting with red and yellow hues. The environment features a counter with typical diner elements like condiment bottles, and the walls are adorned with retro-style decor, including a prominent logo or sign. The atmosphere suggests a casual, relaxed vibe, with the lighting casting a warm glow that highlights her features and creates a lively, nostalgic, and inviting ambiance. The scene remains consistent throughout, maintaining its focus on the interior's cozy and intimate feel, with the camera remaining at the subject's level, panning left and moving to the right to capture more of the subject's front.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
