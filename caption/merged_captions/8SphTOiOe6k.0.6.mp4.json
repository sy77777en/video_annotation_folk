  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide, eye-level scenery shot of a Japanese town street on a bright, sunny day. Initially, the frame captures a view down the road, with pedestrians in the middle ground on the right and a green, tree-covered mountain in the background under a blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds. A traditional building with a tan facade, a red awning, and a dark tiled roof sits on the corner in the middle ground on the left. A smaller, single-story structure with a brown wooden exterior is attached to it, occupying the foreground on the left. The camera, maintaining a deep focus to keep the entire street scene in view, moves forward while executing a slow pan from right to left, with a slight unsteadiness and some shaking. This movement shifts the compositional focus, bringing the two-story building with the red awning to dominate the left and center of the frame. A white van is parked further down on the left, near a building with a white paper lantern hanging outside. The scene is illuminated by late afternoon light, casting long shadows on the asphalt road. By the end of the pan, the pedestrians are no longer visible, and the camera tilts upward slightly, enhancing the tranquil and picturesque quality of the townscape.",

    "Camera": "This is an eye-level, level-angle shot with a deep focus that keeps the entire street scene in view. The camera moves forward while panning left, with a slight unsteadiness and some shaking, and tilts upward slightly at the end of the shot.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a streetscape scenery shot of a quiet Japanese town on a bright, sunny day. There is no single main subject, as the camera's slow pan is designed to capture the overall atmosphere and environment of the location rather than focusing on a particular person or object. The scene is characterized by traditional Japanese architecture, with buildings featuring dark tiled roofs and wooden facades, one of which has a prominent red awning on its upper floor. A few pedestrians stroll along the sidewalk, and a white van is parked near a small outdoor seating area. In the background, green mountains rise against a brilliant blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds, enhancing the tranquil and picturesque quality of the townscape.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenery shot of a quiet street in a Japanese town on a sunny day. The camera slowly pans to the left, focusing on a traditional-style building on a street corner. In the background, mountains are visible under a blue sky with scattered clouds.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, pans slowly from right to left across a street in a Japanese town on a sunny day. The sky is blue with scattered white clouds, and a green, tree-covered mountain is visible in the distance. The scene is illuminated by late afternoon light, casting long shadows on the asphalt road. On the left, a two-story building with a tan facade, a red awning, and a dark tiled roof sits on a corner. In front of it is a smaller, single-story structure with a brown wooden exterior. A few pedestrians are seen walking on the sidewalk on the right side of the street. A white van is parked further down on the left, near a building with a white paper lantern hanging outside.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
