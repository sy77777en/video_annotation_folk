  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a white, rectangular McDonald's self-service kiosk, consistently positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. The kiosk is mounted on a black pole with a black rectangular base, set in a studio-like environment with a blue-grey tiled floor and a blurred, light grey-blue background with soft, out-of-focus light spots. Initially, the camera captures an angled view of the kiosk, focusing on the side of the screen displaying the \"FAST & EASY order & pay here\" message in blue and white text, accompanied by a yellow McDonald's \"M\" logo and the text \"Touch to Order\" below it. A card reader slot is visible beneath the screen, and the side of the white kiosk unit has several small, dark rectangular and circular ports or slots, with two small, thin antennae protruding from the top. The camera starts at an overhead level, looking down at a high angle, and then moves to an eye-level, level-angle view. It uses an extremely shallow depth of field, with the focus on the midground where the kiosk is located. The camera then smoothly arcs in a clockwise direction around the kiosk, revealing the side with the order menu, showcasing images of food items, descriptions, and prices. This movement transitions the view to a direct frontal perspective of the screen, which again shows the \"FAST & EASY order & pay here\" message. By the end of the movement, the camera stabilizes at the kiosk's level. Below the screen, a physical payment terminal slot and a receipt printer slot are visible. The tiled floor is visible in the bottom foreground and middle ground, with a blurred, light background occupying the top and rear of the scene.",

    "Camera": "The camera starts at an overhead level, looking down at a high angle, and then moves to an eye-level, level-angle view. It uses an extremely shallow depth of field, with the focus on the midground where the kiosk is located. The camera quickly arcs clockwise around the kiosk, descending moderately while tilting up. The movement is very smooth.",
    "Subject": "The video showcases a white, rectangular self-service kiosk mounted on a black pole with a black rectangular base. The kiosk features a large vertical touchscreen.

    "Motion": "The video begins with a close-up view of a self-service kiosk, which is white and mounted on a black pole with a black rectangular base. The kiosk features a large vertical touchscreen displaying the text 'FAST & EASY order & pay here' in blue and white, accompanied by a yellow McDonald's 'M' logo and the text 'Touch to Order' below it. As the camera rotates around the kiosk, it reveals the menu side of the screen, showcasing images of food items, descriptions, and prices. The camera continues to move, returning to the 'FAST & EASY order & pay here' side, where it finally stops. The side of the white kiosk unit has several small, dark rectangular and circular ports or slots, and two small, thin antennae protrude from the top of the unit.",
    "Scene": "The video features a white, rectangular McDonald's self-order kiosk mounted on a black pole with a rectangular base, set in a studio-like environment with a blue-grey tiled floor and a blurred, light grey-blue background with soft, out-of-focus light spots. Initially, the camera is positioned at an angle above the kiosk, focusing on the side displaying \"FAST & EASY order & pay here\" in blue and white, along with the McDonald's logo, a graphic of a payment terminal, and text indicating \"Touch to Order.\" The camera then arcs clockwise around the kiosk, revealing another side with a menu of food items and prices, before returning to the original \"FAST & EASY order & pay here\" view, which remains unchanged. Below the screen, a physical payment terminal slot and a receipt printer slot are visible, and two small, thin antennae protrude from the top of the kiosk.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
