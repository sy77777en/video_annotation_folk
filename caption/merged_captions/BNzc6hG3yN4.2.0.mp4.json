  "merged_caption": "In a close-up shot, a Black man with braided hair is positioned in the left foreground against a solid black background. He wears a dark green jacket or jumpsuit, which has a yellow and black circular patch on the left side of the chest and appears slightly distressed. Around his neck is a thick, chunky necklace. Initially seen from the chest up in profile, he looks upward with his mouth slightly open. As he raises his right arm partially, he then lifts his left arm, resulting in both arms being raised. He tilts his head back to look toward the ceiling, and the camera follows his movement, causing his head to move toward the center of the frame. The shot tightens on his face and neck, capturing the light catching the side of his face and jacket. The camera captures the man in the foreground in sharp focus from an eye-level position. Although the background is completely black, making it difficult to confirm any camera movement, the angle appears to be low. The dark setting also obscures the depth of field and any potential camera motion. The camera remains at the same height as the subject throughout the clip.",

Although the background is completely black, making it difficult to confirm any camera movement, the angle appears to be low.

    "Subject": "Against a completely dark background, a Black man with braided hair is visible. He wears a dark green jacket or jumpsuit, which has a yellow and black circular patch on the left side of the chest and appears slightly distressed. Around his neck is a thick, chunky necklace. He looks upward with his mouth slightly open and raises his arms, captured from what seems to be a low-angle perspective.",
    "Motion": "A man, viewed from a low angle against a dark background, looks upward with his right arm partially raised. He then lifts his left arm, resulting in both arms being raised as he tilts his head back to look toward the ceiling.",
    "Scene": "Against a solid black background, a person in a dark green jacket raises their arms and looks upward. The jacket features a zipper on the chest and a small, circular yellow and black pin on his right breast. A thick, beaded necklace is visible around the person's neck, and their hair is styled in braids. The scene is dimly lit, with light catching the side of the person's face and jacket.",
    "Spatial": "In a close-up shot, a man is positioned in the left foreground against a solid black background. He is initially seen from the chest up in profile, looking upward. As he raises his arms and tilts his head back to face the top of the frame, the camera follows his movement, causing his head to move toward the center of the frame, and the shot tightens on his face and neck. The camera remains at the same height as the subject throughout the clip."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
