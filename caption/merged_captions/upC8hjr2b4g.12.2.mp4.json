  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a medium full shot featuring a man in a white lab coat, blue pants, a white shirt, and a belt, with short dark hair and sunglasses, positioned on the right side of the frame in the middle ground. He lacks facial features and is facing forward. To his right and slightly in the foreground on the left side of the frame, a matte white, low-poly, faceless sculpture of a male figure resembling a classical bust is visible, shown in profile and facing the man. The scene is set in a dimly lit indoor environment against a plain, dark greenish-grey wall. The camera is positioned at hip level, looking up from a low angle, employing a shallow depth of field with the focus on the midground where the man is gesturing. His left arm and hand are open, while his right hand is extended with the index finger pointing upward, resembling a 'shushing' gesture. The scene remains static despite the gesture, suggesting a contemplative or analytical interaction. Focused lighting illuminates both figures, leaving the surrounding area in shadow. The shot then transitions to a medium shot, bringing the subjects closer in the frame while maintaining their relative positions. The camera moves slowly and smoothly upward, maintaining the subjects' level throughout. A text overlay \"[26]\" is visible at the bottom left corner of the frame.",

    "Scene": "The scene is set in a dimly lit indoor environment against a plain, dark greenish-grey wall. On the right, a man with dark hair and glasses, wearing a white lab coat, white shirt, and blue trousers, holds a finger to his lips in a shushing gesture while his other hand is extended outwards, palm up. To the left stands a matte white, low-poly, faceless sculpture of a male figure, shown in profile and facing the man. Focused lighting illuminates both figures, leaving the surrounding area in shadow. A text overlay \"[26]\" is visible at the bottom left corner of the frame.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
