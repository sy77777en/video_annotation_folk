  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot showing a red panda with reddish-brown fur, a bushy ringed tail, and a dark face with white markings in the center of the frame, positioned on a wooden platform that is part of a climbing structure. The red panda is in the middle ground, while the climbing structure extends vertically from the bottom center to the top left of the frame. The grassy enclosure, shrubs, and trees fill the foreground and middle ground, with a low, light gray wall featuring a yellow sign with cartoon animals and Japanese text running horizontally across the upper background. The camera is initially at the red panda’s height, capturing the animal as it moves along the platform and down the stairs. The camera slightly pans to the right to keep the red panda centered, then tilts downward to a high angle as the red panda descends the wooden steps from the elevated platform. Once the red panda reaches the grassy ground, the camera maintains a downward tilt and subtly pans right to continue following its movement as it walks toward the left side of the frame, moving away from the structure and continuing to explore the area. The camera angle shifts to an overhead view, placing the red panda in the lower left quadrant of the frame and showing more of the enclosure’s layout from above. Throughout the video, the spatial relationship between the red panda and the climbing structure is maintained, with the red panda jumping down the climbing structure and then moving across the ground. The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking, and deep focus ensures all elements remain sharp throughout. The overall environment is clean and well-maintained, with natural and constructed elements blending together under clear and bright weather.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at eye level and begins with a level angle, tracking the red panda as it moves in the zoo. The camera slightly pans to the right to keep the red panda centered, then tilts downward to a high angle as the red panda descends the stairs. Once the red panda reaches the ground, the camera maintains a downward tilt and subtly pans right to continue following its movement. The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking, and deep focus ensures all elements remain sharp throughout.",
    "Subject": "The video features a red panda with reddish-brown fur, a bushy ringed tail, and a dark face with white markings. The red panda is seen both on a wooden platform supported by a metal frame and on the grassy ground below, jumping from the wooden platform to the grassy ground. Its body is elongated and agile, with short legs and rounded ears, and it appears to be exploring or navigating the structure and the surrounding area.",
    "Motion": "The red panda climbs down the wooden steps from the elevated platform, then walks across the grassy ground, moving away from the structure and continuing to explore the area.",
    "Scene": "The video takes place outdoors in a landscaped enclosure with green grass, patches of dirt, and various shrubs and small trees. A wooden and metal climbing structure with a staircase and platform stands prominently in the center, its steps and surfaces made of light-colored wood supported by dark metal frames. A low, light gray wall with a yellow sign featuring cartoon animals and Japanese text runs along the back of the enclosure, separating the area from a sloped, stone-paved embankment and additional greenery beyond. The weather is clear and bright, with sunlight illuminating the scene. A red panda with a bushy tail moves through the enclosure, at times climbing the structure and at other times walking across the grass. The overall environment is clean and well-maintained, with natural and constructed elements blending together. No overlays or digital elements are present in the video.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a wide shot showing a red panda in the center of the frame, positioned on a wooden platform that is part of a climbing structure.

Throughout the video, the spatial relationship between the red panda and the climbing structure is maintained, with the red panda jumping down the climbing structure and then moving across the ground, while the camera transitions from a level perspective to a higher vantage point."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
