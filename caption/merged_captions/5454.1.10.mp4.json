  "merged_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a diverse group of people standing on a bridge, viewed from below. The subjects occupy the upper portion of the frame, leaning over a dark metal railing that spans horizontally across the middle ground. Their bodies are positioned along the top edge of the frame, with their heads and upper torsos visible. The group is spread out evenly from left to right, with some individuals gesturing or raising their hands. The \"NO BALL GAMES\" sign is located in the center-bottom of the frame, affixed to the railing in the foreground. The background consists of a cloudy sky and bare tree branches, indicating an outdoor urban setting under an overcast, pale grey sky. The camera remains stationary, capturing the scene from a low angle, emphasizing the elevated position of the subjects relative to the viewer. The individuals are dressed in various winter clothing, including jackets and hoodies in different colors like brown, blue, and black, and have varied hairstyles and skin tones. The scene is captured from an objective, low-angle viewpoint, looking up towards an outdoor urban setting. Several individuals are positioned on an elevated walkway or balcony, behind a dark metal railing composed of vertical bars. Directly below the railing, a grey concrete surface displays a white rectangular sign with the black text \"NO BALL GAMES.\" In the upper left, bare, dark tree branches are silhouetted against the sky, with portions of a muted-toned building visible in the background. The camera employs deep focus, keeping all elements in the frame sharp, and there are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial positioning throughout the sequence. The overall scene conveys a sense of casual gathering or interaction among the group.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
