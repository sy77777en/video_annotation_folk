  "merged_caption": "The video features a medium close-up shot of a person lying on a brown leather sofa, with their feet prominently positioned in the foreground, closer to the camera. The feet, adorned with colorful, shiny sprinkles, are centered in the frame, while the rest of the body is slightly blurred in the background, creating a shallow depth of field. The person's head is positioned farther away, towards the right center of the frame, enhancing the sense of depth. The sofa occupies the lower half of the frame, while the upper half consists of empty space and some visible green plants in the background, suggesting a cozy indoor setting with a relaxed atmosphere, likely a living room. The lighting is soft and natural, indicating daytime, with light filtering through a window. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, focusing on the foreground where the feet are prominently displayed. The shallow depth of field keeps the feet in sharp focus while the background remains blurred. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement. The feet move slightly, with toes wiggling and the feet shifting positions, while the person remains mostly still, with only their feet showing noticeable movement. The composition divides the frame, with the lower half occupied by the person on the sofa and the upper half consisting of empty space, enhancing the focus on the feet. The overall composition is calm and casual, focusing on the contrast between the textured leather couch and the sparkling confetti.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
