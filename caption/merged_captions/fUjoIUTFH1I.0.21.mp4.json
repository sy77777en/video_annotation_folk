  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide shot of a city square on an overcast day, focusing on the scenery. A large, white cathedral with classical architecture is centered in the background, framed by bare-branched and evergreen trees. A black wrought-iron fence with a central gate spans the middle ground, serving as an outdoor gallery for street artists. Colorful paintings, including portraits of animals, are displayed on the left side of the fence, while a collection of black-and-white photographs is arranged on the right. A seated artist, wearing a black hat, a black shirt, jeans, and brown shoes, is positioned in the left middle ground next to the paintings, working under a small red umbrella. In the foreground, a man in a tan hat, blue jacket, and brown pants walks from the center toward the left along a paved walkway, passing between the two art displays. The camera is positioned at eye-level and exhibits a slight panning to the left, capturing the entire scene. From a fixed, smooth eye-level position, the camera captures the scene with a level angle. A deep focus is used, ensuring that the entire view, from the artists and their work in the foreground to the large white building in the background, remains sharp and in focus. The camera's wide, static perspective captures the overall environment and atmosphere, distributing focus across the architecture, the street culture of the artists, and the passersby to create a rich sense of place without highlighting a single focal point.",

    "Scene": "An outdoor scene unfolds at a square in a city on an overcast day, with the white facade of a cathedral visible in the background. A black wrought-iron fence separates the cathedral grounds from a paved walkway where artwork is displayed. To the left of a central gate, colorful paintings, including portraits of animals, are hung on the fence, where a person sits in a folding chair next to a small red umbrella. To the right, a collection of black-and-white photographs is arranged. A man in a tan hat and blue jacket walks across the foreground, passing between the two art displays. Bare-branched and evergreen trees frame the cathedral.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
