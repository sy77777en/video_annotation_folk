  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot of Eltz Castle, a large, medieval-style stone structure situated on a hill amidst a dense, lush green forest under an overcast sky. The stone archway and part of the bridge are positioned centrally at the bottom of the frame, with the main castle structure rising in the center middle ground and background. The castle features multiple towers and turrets with dark slate roofs, some of which have half-timbered upper sections with red and white details. The camera, positioned at eye level, begins at a low angle, looking up at the castle, and transitions to a level angle as it moves backward smoothly, revealing a wider, more dramatic view of the entire structure and its surroundings. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to an extreme wide shot, pulling back to reveal more of the bridge, the people walking along it (now more clearly visible in the lower center and lower left/right foreground), and the surrounding dense forest, which fills the middle ground and background on both sides of the frame. The castle remains centrally positioned but appears smaller within the expanded view, emphasizing its placement atop the hill and its relationship to the landscape. A stone bridge leads to the castle's arched entrance, with people walking along the path, serving to emphasize the size of the structure rather than acting as focal points themselves. The camera maintains a level height relative to the bridge and castle throughout the transition, and a deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp. This is a time-lapse video played at a greatly accelerated speed, capturing the grand scale and picturesque atmosphere of the castle within its natural environment.",

    "Camera": "This is a time-lapse video played at a greatly accelerated speed. The camera, positioned at eye level, moves backward smoothly to reveal the entire scene of a castle. The shot begins at a low angle, looking up at the castle, and transitions to a level angle as the camera pulls back. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a landscape scenery shot of a magnificent medieval castle. The structure, built from dark stone, features numerous towers and turrets with red-and-white timber framing and steep, dark-grey slate roofs, all set against a cloudy, overcast sky. The castle is perched on a hill and enveloped by a dense, lush green forest, with a stone bridge leading to an arched gateway where a few people are walking. There is no main subject, as the focus is on capturing the grand scale and picturesque atmosphere of the castle within its natural environment. The people present are incidental, serving to emphasize the size of the structure rather than acting as focal points themselves.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenic shot of a large, medieval stone castle nestled in a dense forest under an overcast sky. A stone bridge leads to the castle's arched entrance, with people walking along the path. The camera pulls back to reveal a wider, more dramatic view of the entire structure and its surroundings.",
    "Scene": "The scene captures Eltz Castle, a large, medieval-style stone structure situated on a hill amidst a dense, green forest under an overcast sky. The castle features multiple towers and turrets with dark slate roofs, some of which have half-timbered upper sections with red and white details. A stone bridge leads up to a prominent stone archway that serves as an entrance. People are visible walking along the bridge towards the castle as the perspective gradually pulls back, revealing more of the bridge and the expansive forested landscape.",
    "Spatial": "The video opens with a wide shot of the castle, showing the stone archway and part of the bridge in the foreground, positioned centrally at the bottom of the frame, with the main castle structure rising in the center middle ground and background. The camera is at approximately the same height as the archway and bridge, looking straight ahead toward the castle. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to an extreme wide shot, pulling back to reveal more of the bridge, the people walking along it (now more clearly visible in the lower center and lower left/right foreground), and the surrounding dense forest, which fills the middle ground and background on both sides of the frame. The castle remains centrally positioned but appears smaller within the expanded view, emphasizing its placement atop the hill and its relationship to the landscape. The camera maintains a level height relative to the bridge and castle throughout the transition."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
