  "merged_caption": "The video uses an extreme wide shot to capture a vast canyon landscape from an aerial perspective. The winding road is positioned in the lower left and center of the frame, occupying the foreground and middle ground as it curves along the edge of the plateau. The steep cliffs and rocky terrain extend from the bottom left to the center and right, also in the foreground and middle ground. Sparse green vegetation and clusters of trees are scattered along the cliff edges and slopes, from the foreground to the middle ground. The wide river appears in the upper and right side of the frame, extending from the middle ground to the background, running parallel to the cliffs and bordered by additional plateaus and rolling hills that stretch across the top and upper right background of the frame. The camera is positioned high above the landscape, looking down from an elevated angle. The camera employs deep focus, keeping both the foreground and background elements—such as the cars on the road, the cliffs, and the river—sharp and clear. The camera smoothly arcs counterclockwise around the cliff, maintaining a steady and fluid motion throughout the shot. The video showcases a scenic aerial view of a winding road atop a rocky cliff, overlooking a wide river and expansive landscape. The area is characterized by dramatic cliffs, sparse vegetation, and the natural beauty and grandeur of the location. The terrain is mostly covered in patches of green shrubs and clusters of trees along the cliff edges and lower slopes. In the middleground, a wide river with calm blue water flows parallel to the cliffs, bordered by additional plateaus and rolling hills that stretch into the distance. The sky is clear, and the lighting suggests early morning or late afternoon, casting soft shadows across the scene. A few vehicles are visible on the road, their shapes and colors contrasting with the natural earth tones of the environment.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at an aerial level with a high angle, looking down over a winding cliffside road and the surrounding landscape. The camera employs deep focus, keeping both the foreground and background elements—such as the cars on the road, the cliffs, and the river—sharp and clear. The camera smoothly arcs counterclockwise around the cliff, maintaining a steady and fluid motion throughout the shot.",
    "Subject": "The video is a landscape scenery shot, capturing an aerial view of a dramatic canyon with rugged, sunlit cliffs and a winding road that curves gracefully along the edge of the plateau. The terrain is characterized by sparse vegetation, with patches of green trees accentuating the contours of the land. In the distance, a wide river glimmers under soft daylight, bordered by layered hills and expansive valleys.",
    "Motion": "The video showcases a scenic aerial view of a winding road atop a rocky cliff, overlooking a wide river and expansive landscape. The area is characterized by dramatic cliffs, sparse vegetation, and the natural beauty and grandeur of the location.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone shows an expansive outdoor landscape during daylight, featuring a winding paved road that curves dramatically atop a high, rocky plateau with steep cliffs. The terrain is mostly covered in patches of green shrubs and clusters of trees along the cliff edges and lower slopes. In the middleground, a wide river with calm blue water flows parallel to the cliffs, bordered by additional plateaus and rolling hills that stretch into the distance. The sky is clear, and the lighting suggests early morning or late afternoon, casting soft shadows across the scene. A few vehicles are visible on the road, their shapes and colors contrasting with the natural earth tones of the environment. No overlays or digital elements are present in the video.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
