  "merged_caption": "In a static medium close-up shot, a man occupies the left side of the frame, while a woman is on the right, both positioned in the foreground. They are turned towards each other, with only one side of their faces visible. The background is indistinct and out of focus. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level, with a slight movement in the first half-second that makes the subjects appear slightly larger in the frame. The man, middle-aged and light-skinned, with short, dark hair, is wearing a dark suit jacket over a light-colored collared shirt and a dark tie. The woman, a young adult with light skin and dark, shoulder-length hair styled in soft waves, is dressed in a dark, high-collared garment and is looking up at the man. The monochromatic scene is set within a dimly lit indoor environment, characterized by low-key lighting that casts deep shadows while illuminating the subjects' faces. As the man's mouth moves to speak, the camera gradually moves closer to them, maintaining a shallow depth of field that focuses on the man and woman in the foreground.",

The man on the left is middle-aged and light-skinned, with short, dark hair. He is wearing a dark suit jacket over a light-colored collared shirt and a dark tie. The woman on the right is a young adult with light skin and dark, shoulder-length hair styled in soft waves. She is dressed in a dark, high-collared garment and is looking up at the man.",

    "Scene": "This monochromatic scene is set within a dimly lit indoor environment. A man in a dark suit and tie is positioned on the left, facing a woman on the right. They are shown in a medium close-up, looking intently at one another. The background is dark and out of focus, and the scene is characterized by low-key lighting that casts deep shadows while illuminating the subjects' faces.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
