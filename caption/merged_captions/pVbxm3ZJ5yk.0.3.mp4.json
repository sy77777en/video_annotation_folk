  "merged_caption": "This is a full shot from inside a refrigerator, with the camera positioned at the same level as a large, round glass bowl in the foreground. Inside the bowl, a dark blue or black high-top sneaker with a white tag is submerged at the bottom center, surrounded by small pieces of green moss. In the middle ground, a red bottle is visible in the top left, and green vegetables are at the top. A plastic container is in the bottom left foreground. Initially, a young man with light skin, wearing a dark beanie and a black jacket, is seen as a reflection on the bowl's surface. He then opens the refrigerator door, and his figure appears more clearly in the background, framed by the opening of the bowl in the top center. He leans forward into the middle ground, reaching past the bowl to retrieve an item located next to it. As the video ends, he begins to move back as the door starts to close. The scene is illuminated by a cool, blue-toned light, revealing other items on the shelves. This is a static shot filmed from an eye-level, level-angle perspective, using a deep depth of field, with the focus encompassing both the fishbowl in the foreground and the background elements.",

    "Subject": "The central focus is a large, round glass bowl, resembling a fishbowl, situated on a wire shelf inside a refrigerator. This bowl is filled with water, containing a submerged dark blue or black high-top sneaker with a white tag on its side. Small pieces of green moss are also present in the water. A young man with light skin, wearing a dark beanie and a black jacket, is initially seen as a reflection on the bowl's surface. He opens the refrigerator door, leans in to look at the contents, and then reaches for an item before starting to close the door.",

    "Scene": "From a perspective inside a refrigerator, a large, round glass fishbowl rests on a wire shelf. Submerged in the water within the bowl is a dark-colored high-top sneaker, accompanied by small clumps of green moss. Behind the bowl, a person wearing a dark beanie is visible, looking into the refrigerator. The scene is illuminated by a cool, blue-toned light, revealing other items on the shelves, such as a red bottle and green vegetables in a drawer above.",

Inside the bowl, a dark shoe is submerged at the bottom center. In the middle ground, a red bottle is visible in the top left, and green vegetables are at the top. A plastic container is in the bottom left foreground. Initially, a person wearing a beanie is seen through the top of the bowl.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
