  "merged_caption": "The video presents a full shot of an ostrich, which is centrally positioned in the frame and occupies the middle ground, standing on brownish grass located at the bottom of the frame. The ostrich has a large body covered in dense black feathers, a long, slender, pale pinkish-beige neck, and a small head with a reddish hue on its crown and beak area. Its long, thick pinkish legs have two distinct dark joints, and its tail consists of fluffy feathers that are a mix of white, beige, and some black. The ostrich is viewed in full left profile, standing still in a field, facing towards the left of the frame. In the foreground, there is green vegetation with purple flowers and dry brownish grass, with blurred purple flowers swaying at the bottom of the frame. The background, visible behind the ostrich and extending to the top-center of the frame, consists of more green vegetation, scattered bushes, a flat horizon line, and a bright, hazy sky with faint clouds and distant birds. The scene unfolds in a sunlit, open outdoor expanse, characteristic of a savanna or vast grassy plain. The camera is static at eye level, maintaining a level angle and employing a shallow depth of field, with the focus set on the midground where the ostrich is visible. An overlay, consisting of a white rectangular box with the word \"OSTRICH\" in white capital letters, is positioned in the lower left corner of the frame.",

    "Scene": "The scene unfolds in a sunlit, open outdoor expanse, characteristic of a savanna or vast grassy plain. In the foreground, greener vegetation dotted with small purple flowers and scattered green bushes transitions into the ground, which is carpeted with dry, brownish grass. Further into the landscape, there is more green vegetation dotted with small purple flowers and scattered green bushes. The sky above is bright and slightly hazy, with faint, wispy clouds stretching towards a flat horizon line in the far distance, where distant birds can be seen in the sky. An overlay, consisting of a white rectangular box with the word \"OSTRICH\" in white capital letters, is positioned in the lower left corner.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
