  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of a city street in Chicago during a winter dusk, with the entrance to an underground passage positioned in the bottom center foreground. A large, light-colored stone building occupies the left side of the frame, while a street with a moving city bus is on the right. The entrance is marked by a blue sign that reads “GRANT PARK N GARAGE, 25 N Michigan Ave, Randolph Lobby,” and is framed by dark, ornate metal railings. The scene is lit by streetlights under an overcast sky, with other pedestrians and traffic visible in the background. A woman with shoulder-length blonde hair, wearing a long, tan-colored coat and carrying a black purse with a chain strap over her right shoulder, enters from the top left and walks toward the center. The camera follows her from behind as she enters the frame, and the framing becomes a medium shot of her from behind. She proceeds to descend the central staircase, placing her left hand on the metal handrail for support. The camera moves alongside her, smoothly following her descent from an eye-level perspective, then tilts down, shifting from a level to a high angle to track her movement. Throughout her descent, the camera remains positioned above her, maintaining a deep focus with a large depth of field, as the ornate metal railings of the staircase frame her on the left and right.",

    "Scene": "On a city street in Chicago during a winter dusk, a woman in a tan coat descends a staircase into an underground passage. The entrance, marked by a blue sign that reads “GRANT PARK N GARAGE, 25 N Michigan Ave, Randolph Lobby,” is framed by dark, ornate metal railings. To the left stands a large, light-colored stone building, and to the right, a city bus moves along the street, which has patches of snow. The scene is lit by streetlights under an overcast sky, with other pedestrians and traffic visible in the background.",

A large building occupies the left side of the frame, while a street with a moving bus is on the right. A woman then enters from the top left and walks toward the center, at which point the framing becomes a medium shot of her from behind.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
