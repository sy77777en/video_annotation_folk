  "merged_caption": "In a close-up, first-person perspective shot, a person with light skin is seen lying on a bed, with their left hand held up in the foreground, positioned in the center-left of the frame. The palm is open and facing forward, bathed in a warm, reddish-orange light. Subtle movements resemble the stretching of fingers, and a visual distortion effect creates a shimmering red and green outline around the hand. In the middle ground, the person's legs, covered in blue jeans, and bare feet are visible on the right side, extending toward the bottom of the frame. The right leg is extended while the left leg is initially bent and then stretches out. The background is split, with a brightly lit window on the right, showing an out-of-focus view of trees and a car outside, and a dimly lit beige-colored wall on the left, with a small, framed picture hanging in the distance. The camera appears unsteady at the subject's level, simulating their point of view while lying down. From a level angle, eye-level perspective, the slightly unsteady, fixed camera focuses on the hand in the foreground, with a shallow depth of field blurring the person lying on the bed in the background. The entire video is overlaid with a trippy filter, and post-edited ripple-like effects appear in the middle of the video, enhancing the shimmering outline around the fingers.",

Their left hand is held up in front of the camera, with the palm open and facing forward, bathed in a warm, reddish-orange light. The person is wearing blue jeans, and their bare feet are visible resting further down on the bed.",

    "Scene": "From a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, a hand is held up in the foreground while lying on a bed in a dimly lit room. A warm, orange light from the side illuminates the palm, and a slight visual distortion creates a shimmering red and green outline around the fingers. In the midground, the person's legs, covered in blue jeans, and bare feet are visible further down the bed. A window with curtains shows a bright, out-of-focus view of trees and a car outside. The room's walls are beige-colored, with a small, framed picture hanging in the distance.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
