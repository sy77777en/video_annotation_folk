  "merged_caption": "This wide shot presents a static, low-angle view of the sky from a worm's-eye perspective, looking directly up at the night sky. In the foreground, a large rock formation occupies the bottom left of the frame, while a second rock formation is positioned on the bottom center-right. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping both the foreground rock formations and the stars sharp. The background is filled by the sky, which undergoes a time-lapse transition. Initially, the day sky is visible with wispy clouds moving quickly across the center and top of the frame, partially obscuring the sun. As the time-lapse progresses, these clouds gradually dissipate, revealing a clear, dark night sky densely populated with stars. The Milky Way becomes increasingly visible, emerging in stunning detail against the inky blackness, and becomes prominent in the center and upper regions of the scene. The video captures a dramatic time-lapse of the night sky over a rugged, rocky terrain, emphasizing the grand scale of the cosmos against the static, earthly landscape. Framing the lower portion of the view are the silhouettes of two large rock formations, their reddish-brown surfaces catching the faint ambient light. The sequence captures the transition from day to night, starting with a low-angle view of the daytime sky framed by two large, reddish-brown rock formations in the foreground. As darkness deepens, the starfield becomes incredibly dense, with the luminous band of the Milky Way galaxy emerging in stunning detail. There is no single main subject, as the focus is intentionally placed on the vastness of the environment and the atmospheric transition.",

    "Camera": "This is a time-lapse video shot from a static, worm's-eye view, looking directly up at the night sky. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping both the foreground rock formations and the stars sharp.",
    "Subject": "The video presents a landscape scenery shot, capturing a dramatic time-lapse of the night sky over a rugged, rocky terrain. Initially, wispy clouds streak across a dusky blue sky, gradually clearing to reveal a breathtaking celestial display. As darkness deepens, the starfield becomes incredibly dense, with the luminous band of the Milky Way galaxy emerging in stunning detail against the inky blackness.

    "Motion": "This time-lapse video begins with a blue sky and clouds moving quickly across a rocky landscape. As the time-lapse progresses, the sky transitions to night, revealing a brilliant, star-filled sky. The Milky Way becomes increasingly visible as the clouds dissipate.",
    "Scene": "A time-lapse sequence captures the transition from day to night, starting with a low-angle view of the daytime sky framed by two large, reddish-brown rock formations in the foreground. Initially, wispy white clouds streak rapidly across a blue-grey sky, partially obscuring the sun. As the sequence progresses, the sky darkens, the clouds dissipate completely, and a multitude of stars emerge, revealing the dense, luminous band of the Milky Way.",
    "Spatial": "This wide shot presents a static, low-angle view of the sky.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
