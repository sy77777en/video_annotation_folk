  "merged_caption": "This wide shot, filmed from an eye-level perspective, moves forward down a narrow city street. A construction site fenced off with white panels and orange traffic cones occupies the left foreground and extends into the left middle ground, where a worker is present. On the right, a restaurant with a yellow and brown facade is situated in the middle ground. Several pedestrians are visible; one man walks from the center middle ground toward the camera before exiting on the right. He is followed by another man in a denim jacket and cap, wearing a face mask, who walks from the center middle ground, moves toward the right foreground, and passes the camera on the right. Other people, including a worker in a yellow vest, are located further back in the center middle ground and background. The scene is framed by tall buildings on both the left and right, which recede into the background. The video is shot at eye level with a level camera angle, capturing a first-person POV moving forward along a bustling urban street. The camera employs deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping all elements sharp. The movement is slightly unsteady with noticeable handheld shakiness, enhancing the immersive experience of walking through the street. The setting is outdoors, likely in a city known for its vibrant signage, as colorful neon signs and advertisements adorn the buildings. The time of day appears to be either early morning or late afternoon, with natural light illuminating the scene. The street is flanked by a variety of shops and restaurants, their windows displaying bright posters and menus. The overall environment is dynamic, with a sense of movement and activity typical of a busy city street.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
