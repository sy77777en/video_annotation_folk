  "merged_caption": "A cartoon boy with brown, spiky hair, a dark top, and light-colored pants walks on a wooden platform, flanked by two green, vine-like ladders. The scene is set in a side-view gaming video with a side camera capturing an outdoor, jungle-like canyon with a brightly lit, hazy yellow background rendered in a painted style. The environment consists of multiple levels of wooden platforms constructed from brown logs and adorned with green vines. Some platforms have blue vertical interiors visible through slats, and they are connected by green, vine-like ladders. The ground below the platforms is covered with green ferns and spikes. Initially, the boy walks forward, but his motion reverses as he runs to the left, backward, creating a blurred afterimage. He leaps onto the edge of the nearby platform. Another wooden platform is positioned in the top left, while a cannon-like device with a fuse hangs from a rope in the top center. The camera, from a side-view perspective, smoothly tracks the avatar, trucking slightly to the right before transitioning to the left, matching the avatar's speed as it moves. During the action, two UI elements are overlaid in the top left corner of the frame, displaying two almost square outlines, one with a pattern and one hollow. An artillery device with a fuse is in the upper portion of the scene.",

    "Subject": "A cartoon boy with brown, spiky hair, a dark top, and light-colored pants is shown in two distinct states. In both states, he remains a solid figure, with the second state featuring motion blur due to fast-paced movement. The scene also features wooden platforms and ladders, some decorated with green vines. A cannon device with a fuse hangs from a rope. In the top left corner, two almost square outlines are visible, one with a pattern and one hollow.",
    "Motion": "Initially walking forward, the cartoon boy's motion reverses. He then runs to the left, backward, creating a blurred afterimage, and leaps onto the edge of the nearby platform.",
    "Scene": "In a side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene in profile, the setting is an outdoor, jungle-like canyon with a brightly lit, hazy yellow background rendered in a painted style. The environment consists of multiple levels of wooden platforms constructed from brown logs and adorned with green vines. Some platforms have blue vertical interiors visible through slats, and they are connected by green, vine-like ladders. The ground below the platforms is covered with green ferns and spikes. An artillery device with a fuse is in the upper portion of the scene. An overlay in the top-left corner displays two almost square outlines, one with a pattern and one hollow.",
    "Spatial": "A cartoon boy with a solid form walks on a wooden platform, flanked by two green, vine-like ladders. Another wooden platform is positioned in the top left, while a cannon-like device hangs from a rope in the top center. The boy jumps to the left, then moves rapidly across the bottom platform, his form blurring with motion. The camera moves to the right and then to the left during the action, with two UI elements overlaid in the top left corner of the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
