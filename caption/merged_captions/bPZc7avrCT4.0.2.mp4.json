  "merged_caption": "This close-up shot features a dark green, circular kicking tee in the bottom left foreground, resting on green grass marked by a white line that extends diagonally from the bottom left foreground. In the mid-right area, a purple water balloon is mid-burst, creating a large spray of water. A human foot, clad in a red sock and white cleat with black and orange details, is visible in the top right of the frame, having completed the kicking motion and moving through the air towards the right, remaining in the mid-ground. The remnants of the purple balloon are moving through the air towards the mid-right area. The foot continues its trajectory from the mid-right area, remaining distinct within the frame. The dense water spray dissipates into airborne droplets. The video features a speed ramp effect, transitioning between slow and normal speed playback. The camera is positioned at ground level, capturing the scene from a high angle. It employs a shallow depth of field, with the focus set on the midground. The camera remains completely static throughout the shot. The scene is brightly lit, suggesting daytime.",

    "Camera": "The video features a speed ramp effect, transitioning between slow and normal speed playback. The camera is positioned at ground level, capturing the scene from a high angle. It employs a shallow depth of field, with the focus set on the midground. The camera remains completely static throughout the shot.",
    "Subject": "A human foot, clad in a white cleat with black and orange details and a red sock featuring a white and blue pattern, is poised next to a purple water balloon that has already burst. The balloon, positioned next to a black, circular kicking tee on green grass, has sent a spray of water droplets into the air.",
    "Motion": "A human foot, clad in a white cleat and a sock featuring a combination of red, blue, and white colors, moves from the right side of the frame further to the right. A purple water balloon is positioned next to a black, circular kicking tee on green grass. The balloon appears to be bursting from the start, sending a spray of water droplets upwards and outwards. The foot continues its follow-through motion to the right, passing through the dispersing water.",
    "Scene": "The video shows a close-up, objective shot of a green grass field, marked with a white line. A black kick-off tee rests on the grass. A spray of water erupts as a bursting water balloon is propelled through the water. A foot wearing a white cleat with red and dark blue accents on the sock area kicks through the water spray. The scene is brightly lit, suggesting daytime.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
