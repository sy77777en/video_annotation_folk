  "merged_caption": "This video presents a medium shot focused on the main kayaker, who is paddling in the rear and occupies the center foreground of the frame throughout. The red kayak they are in is positioned in the center foreground. The kayaker, wearing a red long-sleeved outer garment, a black and green life vest, and a grey helmet with an orange and white \"Teva\" logo, uses a double-bladed paddle, which moves across the center and sides of the frame in the foreground. The water fills the lower and central portions of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground. Steep, grey, rocky canyon walls flank the scene on the left and right sides, running from the foreground into the background. A second kayaker is partially visible ahead in the center middle ground, initially leading the way. Positioned above the water at a high angle, the camera looks down on the main kayaker with a varying Dutch angle due to rolling, maintaining deep focus with a large depth of field. The unsteady, shaky camera tail-tracks the kayaker, moving forward through the canyon, panning to follow the winding path, and moving down slightly as the kayaker enters a narrower passage. Initially, both kayaks move steadily through the water, but as they approach an area with intensifying white-water rapids, the main subject paddles vigorously. Upon entering the more turbulent waters, both individuals lift their paddles and cease paddling vigorously. Despite this, the speed of both kayaks increases significantly due to the strong current, as the rocky canyon walls close in around them. The main kayaker and his kayak move forward, remaining centered in the frame, navigating through the canyon as the water transitions from relatively calm to turbulent whitewater in the middle ground.",

    "Subject": "The video features two individuals kayaking through a narrow canyon with steep, grey, rocky walls. The main subject, viewed from behind, is wearing a red long-sleeved outer garment, a black and green life vest, and a grey helmet with an orange and white \"Teva\" logo. They are seated in a red kayak, actively paddling with a double-bladed paddle through turbulent water. At the beginning of the video, another individual is visible in the background, positioned ahead of the main subject. This person is also wearing a red long-sleeved outer garment and a helmet while seated in a separate kayak. As the video progresses, this individual drifts forward and eventually moves out of the frame. The main subject continues to navigate the kayak forward, moving through the confined waterway towards a more agitated section of whitewater ahead.",
    "Motion": "The video features a person in the foreground kayaking through a narrow canyon with steep, grey, rocky walls, while another paddles further ahead. Initially, both kayaks move steadily through the water, with the main subject wearing a red jacket, black and green life vest, and a helmet with an orange and white 'Teva' logo. As they approach an area with intensifying white-water rapids, the main subject paddles vigorously with a double-bladed paddle. Upon entering the more turbulent waters, both individuals lift their paddles and cease paddling vigorously. Despite this, the speed of both kayaks increases significantly due to the strong current, as the rocky canyon walls close in around them.",
    "Scene": "A locked-on POV shot captures the perspective from a red kayak navigating a narrow, rocky canyon during the day. The steep canyon walls, composed of gray, textured rock, rise closely on either side of the dark, moving water. Two kayakers are featured: the one in front is leading, while the one behind, dressed in a red jacket, a black and green life vest, and a gray helmet, paddles to propel the kayak forward. The video progresses from calmer water into faster-moving whitewater rapids within the confined space of the canyon.",
    "Spatial": "This video presents a medium shot focused on the main kayaker, who is paddling in the rear and occupies the center foreground of the frame throughout. The red kayak they are in is positioned in the center foreground. The kayaker uses a paddle, which moves across the center and sides of the frame in the foreground.

The main kayaker and his kayak move forward, remaining centered in the frame, navigating through the canyon as the water transitions from relatively calm to turbulent whitewater in the middle ground. The camera is positioned above the main subject, maintaining a rear perspective, but it shakes in response to the turbulent water."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
