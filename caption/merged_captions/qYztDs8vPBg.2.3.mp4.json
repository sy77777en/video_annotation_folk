  "merged_caption": "In a close-up, top-down shot, a gold-colored smartphone is held horizontally, occupying the center of the frame on a clean white surface. The phone's screen is illuminated with colorful app icons, and a white paper strip with handwritten numbers from 2 to 9 is taped across the top of the screen. In the foreground, a left hand is positioned on the bottom left, while a right hand is on the bottom right, holding a silver, pen-like metal tool with a pointed tip. The right hand firmly grips the tool and follows the instructions on the numbered paper guide, moving it back and forth to create scratches on the phone's screen, which is in the middle ground. As the tool glides horizontally across the screen, the phone shifts slightly due to the force of the movement, but the left hand promptly returns it to its original position to keep it steady. The static, bird's-eye view shot captures the scene with deep focus, ensuring all elements remain in sharp detail. In the background, a silver rectangular object with a white label reading \"JerryRigEverything\" is visible at the top, along with the tips of other small screwdrivers and a yellow tool in the top left corner, all resting on the white surface.",

    "Subject": "A pair of light-skinned hands holds a gold-colored smartphone horizontally on a white surface. The phone's screen is on, displaying the iOS home screen. A white paper strip with handwritten numbers from 2 to 9 is taped across the top of the screen. The right hand holds a silver, pen-like metal tool with a pointed tip and is actively scratching the surface of the phone's screen, moving along the numbered guide. The left hand steadies the top of the phone.

The left hand holds the phone steady on a white surface while the right hand conducts the scratching test.",
    "Scene": "A static, bird's-eye view shot where the camera is positioned directly above the subject for a top-down perspective shows a scene set on a clean white surface. A pair of hands holds a gold-colored smartphone, its screen illuminated with colorful app icons. A white paper strip with handwritten numbers from 2 to 9 is taped across the top of the screen. One hand uses a silver, pen-like metal tool with a pointed tip to systematically scratch the glass screen, moving along the numbered guide. In the background, other precision tools and a black and white branded object with the text 'JerryRigEverything' are visible on the white surface.",
    "Spatial": "In a close-up, top-down shot, a gold-colored smartphone is held horizontally, occupying the center of the frame. In the foreground, a left hand is positioned on the bottom left, while a right hand is on the bottom right, holding a silver metal tool that glides across the phone's screen. The tool, located in the center-right foreground, moves horizontally across the phone's screen, which is in the middle ground. A white paper strip is taped across the top of the phone, also in the middle ground. As the video progresses, the phone shifts slightly due to the force of the movement, but the left hand promptly returns it to its original position. In the background, a silver metal object with a white name tag is visible at the top, with a silver tool on the right side of the frame and a yellow tool in the top left corner, all resting on a white surface."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
