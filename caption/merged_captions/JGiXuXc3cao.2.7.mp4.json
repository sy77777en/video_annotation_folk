  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot, a light-skinned, middle-aged man with short, dark hair is positioned in the right foreground, seen from his left side and back. He is wearing a light-colored, short-sleeved collared shirt and stands inside what appears to be a vessel, facing a wall in the middle ground. This wall is lined with large, circular, brightly illuminated portholes occupying the left and center of the frame, each set within a heavy, bolted frame. Below the windows, various pieces of equipment, including a brass-colored, bell-shaped gauge and a small, orange control box, are mounted on the wall in the bottom left middle ground. Exposed pipes and fixtures run along the ceiling. The man remains in a fixed position, but his head moves slightly, turning from looking forward to looking down at a control panel, continuing to operate the controls with his hands. The camera is stationary and positioned at the man's level, capturing the scene from a low, hip-level angle. It remains fixed but slightly unsteady, with a deep focus keeping the entire scene sharp and a large depth of field.",

    "Subject": "A light-skinned, middle-aged man with short, dark hair is seen from his left side and back. He is wearing a light-colored, short-sleeved collared shirt. He stands inside what appears to be a vessel, facing a wall lined with several large, circular, brightly lit portholes. His head is slightly bowed as he looks down at the equipment in front of him.",
    "Motion": "A man stands in front of a wall of lit portholes, looking down at a control panel. He briefly turns his head to the right, looking forward, and then returns his gaze downward, continuing to operate the controls with his hands.",
    "Scene": "The interior of a vessel is characterized by its functional, industrial design. A white wall is lined with a row of large, circular portholes, each set within a heavy, bolted frame. These portholes are brightly illuminated from an unseen external source, appearing as solid white discs. Below the windows, various pieces of equipment are mounted, including a brass-colored, bell-shaped gauge and a small, orange control box. Exposed pipes and fixtures run along the ceiling, and a man in a light-colored, short-sleeved shirt stands facing the wall.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
