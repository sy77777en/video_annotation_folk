  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot, framing a young girl with light skin and dark hair on the center-left of a circular balcony that occupies the foreground. She wears a red hood over a patterned tunic in shades of orange and brown, along with grey pants and dark boots. The balcony is part of a weathered lighthouse, constructed from large, light-gray metal panels marked with rust stains. It is daytime, but the sky is obscured by heavy fog and falling rain. Initially, the entire lighthouse structure is in the foreground. As the camera, from an aerial, level angle, executes a smooth, complex movement, sliding left, panning right, and pushing forward, the weathered wall of the lighthouse transitions to the background, with the girl in the midground and the railing in the foreground. The camera moves leftward, pans right, and pushes forward, transitioning to a full shot of the girl. As the camera centers on the little girl standing on the lighthouse balcony, she opens a weathered white door behind her and steps fully onto the wet, circular, black metal walkway, moving slightly forward and toward the center of the frame. She looks up into the rain, initially placing her hands palm-up in front of her chest before spreading them open with her palms facing upward. The shot concludes with the girl positioned in the left center of the frame, standing in the middle ground, with the camera maintaining a steady forward push and remaining at her level throughout, keeping the entire scene sharp.",

    "Camera": "From an aerial, level angle, the camera executes a smooth, complex movement, simultaneously sliding left, panning right, and pushing forward. This motion resolves into a steady forward push as it centers on the little girl standing on the lighthouse balcony. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "A young girl with light skin and dark hair stands on the wet, circular balcony of a weathered, white, cylindrical structure. She wears a red hood over a patterned tunic in shades of orange and brown, along with grey pants and dark boots. She opens a weathered white door, steps fully onto the balcony, and initially places her palms facing upwards in front of her chest before spreading both hands open into the falling rain.",
    "Motion": "A young girl opens a weathered white door and steps out onto a circular balcony. She looks up into the rain, initially placing her hands palm-up in front of her chest before spreading them open with her palms facing upward.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures the balcony of a weathered lighthouse during a storm. The scene is set on a circular, black metal walkway that wraps around the lighthouse, which is constructed from large, light-gray metal panels marked with rust stains. It is daytime, but the sky is obscured by heavy fog and falling rain. A single, worn door opens, and a person in a red-hooded garment steps out onto the wet walkway and looks up into the rain.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
