  "merged_caption": "A medium shot frames a female-presenting cyborg with a completely shaved head in the foreground, positioned in front of horizontal orange light bars in the background. The scene is set within a dark, indoor space saturated in monochromatic red light, with the air hazy and diffusing the light to create a soft glow. Reflective surfaces in the background catch and mirror the red illumination. The cyborg's torso is covered with a textured, mesh-like material from her neck down to her chest, while her transparent abdomen, arms, and neck reveal a reflective, chrome-like metallic structure beneath, including intricate components, joints, and some glowing blue elements inside. The camera begins at a high angle, looking down at the cyborg, and then performs a smooth upward tilt, transitioning to a level angle. As the camera ascends, the cyborg, initially facing toward the right, remains standing and gradually lifts her head, then slightly lowers it while maintaining a forward gaze and revealing a calm facial expression. By the end of the shot, her face and upper body are positioned to the right of the center of the frame. A shallow depth of field is maintained throughout, keeping the focus on the figure in the foreground.",

    "Camera": "This eye-level shot begins at a high angle, looking down at a robotic figure. The camera then performs a smooth upward tilt, which brings the view to a level angle. A shallow depth of field is maintained throughout, keeping the focus on the figure in the foreground.",
    "Subject": "A female-presenting cyborg with a completely shaved head is shown from the chest up. The area from her neck down to her chest is covered with a textured, mesh-like material. Her abdomen, arms, and neck are transparent, clearly revealing the reflective, chrome-like metallic structure beneath, which includes intricate components, joints, and some glowing blue elements inside. As the camera tilts upward, she remains standing, slowly lifts her head, and then slightly lowers it, revealing a calm facial expression.",
    "Motion": "The camera tilts upward from the torso of a stationary cyborg. As the camera ascends, the cyborg gradually lifts her head and then lowers it, maintaining a forward gaze.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set within a dark, indoor space saturated in monochromatic red light. The air is hazy, diffusing the light and creating a soft glow. Bright, horizontal orange light bars are positioned solely in the background, cutting across the dim environment. Reflective surfaces in the background catch and mirror the red illumination. A figure with a metallic lower torso stands in the center of the room, featuring a transparent abdomen, arms, and neck that clearly reveal the chrome-like internal structure beneath.",
    "Spatial": "A medium shot frames a cyborg in the foreground, positioned in front of horizontal orange light bars in the background. The camera starts by focusing on the cyborg's torso and then tilts upward. As the camera moves, the cyborg, initially facing toward the right, remains standing and gradually lifts her head, then slightly lowers it while looking straight ahead. By the end of the shot, her face and upper body are positioned to the right of the center of the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
