  "merged_caption": "A close-up shot shows a faceless mannequin head positioned in the center-right of the frame, occupying the foreground. The head is made of a smooth, matte, pale white material and is completely devoid of any facial features such as eyes, a nose, or a mouth. It has neatly styled black hair, combed into a side part, with visible texture suggesting individual strands. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, capturing it from a three-quarter view against a blurry, neutral gray background. The camera remains focused on the subject while moving smoothly and slowly, craning down in a slight arc throughout the shot. The faceless mannequin head remains completely still throughout the video. The setting is softly lit, and the dark collar of a shirt is partially visible at the base of the neck. A white overlay text \"[10]\" is located in the lower left corner of the screen.",

    "Scene": "In a softly lit indoor setting, a close-up shot focuses on a smooth, white, featureless head, similar to a mannequin. The head has textured, black hair neatly styled to the side. The background is a simple, out-of-focus, neutral gray wall. A white overlay text \"[10]\" is located in the lower left corner of the screen.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
