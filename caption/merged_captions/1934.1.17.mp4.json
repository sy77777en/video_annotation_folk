  "merged_caption": "The video features a medium close-up of a young person standing in front of an older man, both wearing white hooded suits with orange stripes and goggles resting on their foreheads. The young person, with short blonde hair visible under the hood and a fair skin tone, is positioned slightly to the left and at the bottom center of the foreground, maintaining a focused expression. The older man, with a mustache and a fair skin tone, appears concerned and is slightly to the right in the right foreground, shown in a medium shot. Both subjects' upper bodies and faces are clearly visible, facing forward as if looking at something directly ahead. In the background, which is out of focus, a lab worker in white is conducting experiments alone, situated towards the top right-center, further back in the scene. The environment is predominantly white, with smooth surfaces and minimalistic design elements, creating a stark, clinical atmosphere. The lighting is bright and even, contributing to the clean and controlled ambiance. The camera is shot from an eye-level height with a high angle, looking down, featuring a shallow depth of field that focuses on the foreground. The camera remains fixed but slightly unsteady, maintaining a consistent perspective on the two main subjects as the focal point while subtly including the background activity. The older man speaks while the young person remains still, showing minimal movement and looking straight ahead throughout the video.",

    "Subject": "The video features a young person and an older man, both wearing white hooded suits with orange stripes. They have goggles resting on their foreheads.

    "Motion": "The video shows a young person positioned in front of an older man, both dressed in white hooded suits with orange stripes and wearing goggles. They are in a white room with indistinct objects in the background. The older man speaks while the young person remains still, showing minimal movement and looking straight ahead throughout the video.",
    "Scene": "The video presents an indoor setting with a stark, clinical atmosphere. The environment is predominantly white, featuring smooth surfaces and minimalistic design elements. Two individuals are present, dressed in white suits with orange stripes, wearing goggles on their heads. In the background, a lab worker in white is conducting experiments alone. The lighting is bright and even, contributing to the clean and controlled ambiance of the scene.",
    "Spatial": "The video features a medium close-up of a young person standing in front of an older man, both occupying the central area of the frame. The young person is positioned slightly to the left and at the bottom center of the foreground, while the older man is slightly to the right and in the right foreground, shown in a medium shot. Both subjects' upper bodies and faces are clearly visible. In the background, which is out of focus, there is a lab worker situated towards the top right-center, further back in the scene. The camera remains at the subjects' eye level throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective. The overall composition keeps the two main subjects as the focal point while subtly including the background activity."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
