  "merged_caption": "The video focuses on a sepia-toned close-up of a young man's head, centered against a dark, textured background. The head, possibly a sculpture or bust, features dark, wavy hair styled in a pompadour with prominent, long sideburns. His face is shown in a three-quarter profile, looking towards the right, with a strong jawline and a slightly open mouth. A jagged, torn paper edge runs horizontally across the bottom, revealing a white surface below, with an overlay of text reading \"wikipedia.org\" in the bottom-left corner. The video displays a black and white image of the young man's head, with a subtle zoom-in effect throughout the clip. The camera smoothly zooms in on the black-and-white headshot of the man and then remains static. The image is presented as a torn photograph, with a jagged, white paper edge running horizontally across the bottom of the frame. The entire arrangement is set against a solid black background.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
