  "merged_caption": "A young boy with pale skin and short, dark, messy hair is featured in a close-up shot, positioned in the center of the frame and occupying the foreground. He has large, light-colored eyes with prominent dark circles underneath and is wearing a dark, collared shirt with a subtle ribbed texture. The background is dark and out of focus, containing indistinct shapes. The scene is set in a dark, indistinct environment, with the background composed of blurred, dark shapes. The lighting is dim, with a single source illuminating the central subject from the front, casting soft shadows. The overall color palette is muted and cool, dominated by shades of gray and black. The camera remains stationary and is positioned at the boy's level throughout the shot, employing an extremely shallow depth of field that renders the background completely out of focus. Initially, the boy looks forward with wide eyes and a slightly agape mouth, then briefly lowers his head and gaze with a sad expression before looking up again with furrowed brows and a worried frown. He quickly lowers his head once more and snaps it back up, directing his gaze at the camera. Eventually, he lifts a small, round object with both hands toward the center of the frame, bringing it into the center of the foreground.",

    "Camera": "This is a static, eye-level shot with a level angle. The camera focuses on the boy in the foreground, employing an extremely shallow depth of field that renders the background completely out of focus.",
    "Subject": "A young boy with pale skin and short, dark, messy hair is shown in a close-up. He has large, light-colored eyes with prominent dark circles underneath, and he is wearing a dark, collared shirt with a subtle ribbed texture. His expression is somber and shifts subtly throughout the video; his eyes are initially wide and his mouth is slightly agape, then he looks down with a sad expression before looking up again with furrowed brows and a worried frown.",
    "Motion": "A young boy widens his eyes, directing his gaze at the camera. He lowers his head, raises it again, quickly lowers it once more, and snaps it back up. Finally, he lifts a small, round object with both hands toward the center of the frame.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set in a dark, indistinct environment, with the background composed of blurred, dark shapes. The lighting is dim, with a single source illuminating the central subject from the front, casting soft shadows. The overall color palette is muted and cool, dominated by shades of gray and black. The focus remains fixed on a young, animated boy with dark hair and large eyes. Initially, he gazes straight ahead, then lowers his head, raises it again to look forward, looks down, and finally looks up once more. Ultimately, he hands a circular object to the camera using both hands.",
    "Spatial": "A young boy is featured in a close-up shot, positioned in the center of the frame and occupying the foreground. Behind him, the background is dark and out of focus, containing indistinct shapes. The boy initially looks forward, then briefly lowers his head and gaze before looking up again toward the center. Eventually, he lifts a circular object into the center of the foreground. The camera remains stationary and is positioned at the boy's level throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
