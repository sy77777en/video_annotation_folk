  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot featuring a tennis racket positioned diagonally in the center of the frame, extending from the bottom left towards the top right, in the foreground. A yellow, textured tennis ball enters from the top left, also in the foreground, and moves towards the racket. Upon impact, the ball bounces upwards and exits the frame from the top left. Simultaneously, the racket, primarily red and white and angled slightly upward, begins to descend towards the bottom of the frame due to the force of the ball. Red and purple dust, which was on the racket, explodes outwards, initially retaining the racket's shape in the center of the frame and in the foreground. This dust cloud then expands and disperses, with the red portion more prominent on the left and the purple on the right, before slowly drifting downwards and losing its defined shape as the racket moves further down. The background remains consistently dark and out of focus, enhancing the visibility of the dust and the vibrant colors. The camera is static, maintaining a level angle, and employs a shallow depth of field with the focus set on the foreground. A speed ramp effect is used, with playback speed shifting between fast and slow, creating a striking visual effect as the dust disperses in slow motion. The lighting suggests a well-lit environment, possibly during daylight, highlighting the motion and energy of the sport. Notable visual elements include the vibrant colors of the racket and the ball, with a striking effect of colored powder or dust being dispersed upon impact, creating a visually engaging moment.",

    "Camera": "The video features a speed ramp effect, with playback speed shifting between fast and slow. The camera is static, maintaining a level angle. It employs a shallow depth of field, with the focus set on the foreground.",
    "Subject": "The video features a close-up of a tennis ball and a tennis racket. The tennis ball, yellow and textured, bounces into the frame, making contact with the racket. The racket, primarily red and white and angled slightly upward, is covered in red and purple dust, which initially retains the shape of the racket upon impact. This creates a striking visual effect as the dust disperses in slow motion. As the ball bounces out of the frame, the racket descends due to the force, and the dust begins to lose its shape and fall, adding dynamic movement to the scene. The background is dark, enhancing the visibility of the dust and the vibrant colors.",
    "Motion": "The video shows a tennis ball bouncing into the frame and making contact with a tennis racket. Upon impact, red and purple dust on the racket disperses in slow motion, creating a striking visual effect. The racket, angled slightly upward, descends due to the force of the ball. As the ball bounces out of the frame, the dust loses its shape and falls, adding dynamic movement against the dark background.",
    "Scene": "The video captures a dynamic scene featuring a tennis racket and ball, with a focus on their interaction. The lighting suggests a well-lit environment, possibly during daylight. Notable visual elements include the vibrant colors of the racket and the ball, with a striking effect of colored powder or dust being dispersed upon impact. This creates a visually engaging moment, highlighting the motion and energy of the sport. The dark, blurred background emphasizes the vivid colors and movement in the foreground.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a close-up shot. A tennis racket is positioned diagonally in the center of the frame, extending from the bottom left towards the top right, in the foreground.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
