  "merged_caption": "The video opens with an aerial view of a cityscape during sunset, captured by a drone. The primary focus is a tall, modern high-rise building on the left side of the frame, extending from the bottom left towards the top left. Initially, the drone captures the scene from a level angle, then transitions to a low angle as it moves forward. The camera incorporates subtle upward and downward motions while panning left to highlight the building's numerous balconies and glass windows. The video features noticeable fisheye distortion, causing straight lines to curve outward. The camera drone is at an aerial level, transitioning from a level angle to a low angle and incorporating varying Dutch angles despite intense movements. It uses deep focus with a large depth of field. As the video progresses, the drone gradually reveals more of the building's upper floors, with the sky occupying the top portion of the frame. In the background, a parking structure and other city elements are visible in the lower right quadrant, indicating the middle ground. The sky, with its gradient colors, fills the top right section, serving as a backdrop. The camera movement enhances the sense of scale and perspective, smoothly transitioning from the lower levels of the building to its higher sections, emphasizing the building's verticality and the expansive sky. The building's glass windows reflect the warm hues of the sunset, creating a striking contrast with the sky's gradient of orange and blue. The video concludes with a wide shot of the building's upper floors, showing the balconies and the people standing on one of the balconies. The emphasis is on the scale and atmosphere of the cityscape, highlighting the contrast between the structured building and the natural beauty of the sunset.",

    "Camera": "The video features noticeable fisheye distortion, causing straight lines to curve outward. The camera drone is at an aerial level, transitioning from a level angle to a low angle and incorporating varying Dutch angles despite intense movements. It uses deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera drone gradually moves forward with subtle upward and downward motions while panning left to focus on the apartment building. The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot. It captures the towering presence of a modern high-rise building with numerous balconies and large glass windows, set against a vibrant sunset sky. The focus is on the urban environment and the dramatic interplay of architectural lines with the colorful sky, rather than on any specific object or subject. The emphasis is on the scale and atmosphere of the cityscape, highlighting the contrast between the structured building and the natural beauty of the sunset.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a view of a tall building against a backdrop of a sunset sky, with the camera drone gradually moving forward with subtle upward and downward motions while panning left to focus on the apartment building. As the camera progresses, more details of the building's facade, including windows and balconies, become visible. The camera continues to move, revealing more of the building's structure and the surrounding cityscape. The video concludes with a wide shot of the building's upper floors, showing the balconies and the people standing on one of the balconies.",
    "Scene": "The video, captured from a drone POV, presents an aerial view of an urban environment at sunset. The setting is outdoors, featuring a tall, modern building with a red brick facade and numerous balconies. The building's glass windows reflect the warm hues of the sunset, creating a striking contrast with the sky's gradient of orange and blue. Below, a parking structure and other cityscape elements are visible, indicating a bustling urban area. The scene transitions smoothly, maintaining focus on the architectural details and the expansive view of the city skyline, enhanced by the soft, ambient light of the setting sun.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
