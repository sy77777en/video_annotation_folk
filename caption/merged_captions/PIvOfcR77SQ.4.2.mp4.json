  "merged_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot of a snowy landscape. Initially, a dark wooden house is positioned in the right and center of the frame in the middle ground, with a snow-covered road in the foreground and a forest in the background. The video begins with a focus on a large, single-story house, setting the scene before the camera smoothly pans to the right. A car is parked near the house, and the roof of the house is covered with snow. The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, looking straight ahead. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping all elements sharp. As the camera pans smoothly to the right, the house shifts to the far-left edge of the frame, and the view opens up to show more of the snow-covered road extending into the background, bordered by large snowbanks. The forest now fills the middle ground and background across the center and right of the frame. The surrounding forest emphasizes the snowy environment and the expansive, tranquil winter landscape. The video depicts a serene winter scene in a snowy, forested area, set outdoors during the day under an overcast sky that casts a soft, diffused light over the landscape. The environment features a wooden cabin with a sloped roof, completely covered in snow, situated alongside a snow-covered road. The cabin is constructed from dark wood, contrasting with the white snow. Tall evergreen trees, their branches dusted with snow, line the background, creating a natural border. As the camera continues to pan, the snowbanks along the road on the right side exhibit a curved shape. The overall atmosphere is calm and still, with no visible movement or activity.",

    "Camera": "The video uses a wide-angle lens without noticeable distortion. The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, looking straight ahead. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping all elements sharp. The camera smoothly pans right, capturing the snowy landscape and a single building with minimal shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video begins with a focus on a large, single-story house, setting the scene before the camera smoothly pans to the right. This shift in perspective draws the viewer's attention to the surrounding forest, emphasizing the snowy environment and the expansive, tranquil winter landscape.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a view of a snow-covered road flanked by a wooden house on the right and a forest of tall pine trees in the background. A car is parked near the house, and the roof of the house is covered with snow. The camera slowly pans to the right, gradually revealing more of the snowy landscape and the forest. As the camera continues to pan, the house remains partially in left of the frame, and the focus shifts primarily to the snowy road and the forest in the background.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
