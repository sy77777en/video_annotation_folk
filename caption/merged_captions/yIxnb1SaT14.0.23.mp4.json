  "merged_caption": "This video features an extreme wide shot of architectural scenery, focusing on the environment and scale, with human figures present but not as central subjects. The grand, illuminated Sacré-Cœur Basilica in Paris is the central element, positioned in the middle ground and viewed from a low angle. The basilica, with its prominent central dome and smaller flanking domes and towers, stands majestically against a dark, cloudy sky. A wide stone staircase occupies the bottom of the frame, extending upwards towards the center, situated in the foreground and leading into the middle ground. Trees frame the scene on the left and right sides, positioned in the middle ground. The dark, cloudy sky fills the top portion of the frame in the background, with clouds showing movement, characteristic of a time-lapse. Small human figures are visible on the staircase in the foreground and middle ground, moving up and down, indicating movement over time. A bright light source on the right creates a starburst effect. The camera is positioned at eye level and uses a low angle, looking up at the basilica. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera movement is very smooth, panning left while simultaneously moving to the right, capturing more of the cathedral's structure and the surrounding environment. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays the text \"MATHIEU STANIĆ CINEMATOGRAPHER\" in white throughout the video. The focus is on the majestic architecture and the nocturnal atmosphere, highlighting the environment and scale over any specific entity.",

    "Camera": "This is a time-lapse video. The camera is positioned at eye level and uses a low angle, looking up at the Sacré-Cœur Basilica. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera movement is very smooth, panning left while simultaneously moving to the right.",
    "Subject": "This video is an architectural scenery shot, showcasing a grand, white, multi-domed basilica at night, viewed from a low angle looking up a wide stone staircase. The basilica is brilliantly illuminated, standing out against a dark, cloudy sky, with trees framing the scene on either side of the stairs. While numerous indistinct human figures are present on the staircase and in front of the building, they are small in scale, serving to emphasize the structure's immensity rather than acting as a central subject. The focus is thus on the majestic architecture and the nocturnal atmosphere, highlighting the environment and scale over any specific entity.",
    "Motion": "The video shows a grand, illuminated cathedral at night, with a large dome and multiple smaller domes, set against a dark sky. People are seen walking up and down the stairs in front of the cathedral, creating a dynamic scene. The camera slowly moves to the right, capturing more of the cathedral's structure and the surrounding environment. The text 'MATHIEU STANIĆ' and 'CINEMATOGRAPHER' appears in the bottom right corner throughout the video.",
    "Scene": "This time-lapse video, shot at night, features the illuminated Sacré-Cœur Basilica in Paris. The grand, white stone basilica, with its prominent central dome and smaller flanking domes and towers, stands majestically against a dark, cloudy sky. Wide stone steps lead up to the basilica's arched entrances, where figures of people ascend and descend, indicating movement over time. Trees frame the basilica on either side, some catching the ambient light. A bright light source on the right creates a starburst effect. The clouds in the sky also show movement, characteristic of a time-lapse. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays the text \"MATHIEU STANIĆ CINEMATOGRAPHER\" in white.",
    "Spatial": "This video features an extreme wide shot of architectural scenery, focusing on the environment and scale, with human figures present but not as central subjects. The grand, illuminated basilica is the central element, positioned in the middle ground and viewed from a low angle.

Small human figures are visible on the staircase in the foreground and middle ground, moving up and down. A bright light source is present on the right side in the middle ground. A text overlay is consistently positioned in the bottom right corner of the frame. The dynamic aspect comes from the movement of the clouds and the motion of people."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
