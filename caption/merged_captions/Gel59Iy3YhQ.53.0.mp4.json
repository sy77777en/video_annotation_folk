  "merged_caption": "This wide shot, filmed from a high angle, shows a small character with a roughly humanoid form, dressed in a red top and blue pants, in the middle ground, positioned in the upper center of the frame on a winding snowy path. The path is flanked by purple canyon walls that extend from the foreground to the background on the left and right. In the middle ground, a large evergreen tree and a frozen, light-blue body of water are located in the bottom-left quadrant. A row of nine golden, feather-like icons is overlaid in the bottom-left corner, and a small compass with a red arrow pointing north is in the top-right corner. White snowflakes fall continuously throughout the scene. The character walks up the winding, snowy path inside the purple canyon, moving from the upper portion of the screen upwards and to the right, navigating a turn. As the character moves up the path toward the top right, the camera follows, causing the middle ground elements in the bottom left to move out of the frame. From a smooth, high-angle aerial perspective, the camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire pixel-art landscape sharp. It tracks the character skiing up the snowy valley, then rolls counterclockwise and trucks to the right to continue following the character's path. The environment consists of stylized, triangular green trees and a larger, more detailed evergreen tree.",

    "Subject": "In a pixel art video game scene, a small character with a roughly humanoid form, dressed in a red top and blue pants, walks through the snow. The environment consists of stylized, triangular green trees and a larger, more detailed evergreen tree. The rocky canyon walls are rendered in various shades of purple. In the lower-left corner, a row of identical golden, feather-like collectibles is displayed as overlays. A small compass with a red arrow pointing north is situated in the upper-right corner.",
    "Motion": "A small, pixelated character walks up a winding, snowy path inside a purple canyon. The character moves from the upper portion of the screen upwards and to the right, navigating a turn as the camera rotates to follow their ascent.",
    "Scene": "In a third-person 3D game video with a pixel art style, a character moves up a winding path in a snowy mountain ravine. The steep canyon walls are a textured purple, and the ground is covered in white snow, with a few green, pine-like trees scattered about. In the lower-left area, there is a frozen, light-blue body of water. White snowflakes fall continuously throughout the scene. Overlays are visible on screen: a row of nine golden, feather-like icons is in the bottom-left corner, and a small compass with a red arrow pointing north is in the top-right corner.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
