  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a dark gray, four-door sedan, resembling a Ford Crown Victoria, positioned in the center middle ground, driving away from the camera on a paved city street. The car appears to be an unmarked police vehicle, indicated by two small, flashing lights on the interior rear deck below the back window: a yellow one on the left and a blue one on the right, flashing alternately. In the middle ground to the left, an explosion creates a large plume of smoke and fire, while a building is visible at a distance on both sides of the road. The building on the right, and the distant building on the left, are both possibly made of stone, illuminated by warm, golden light, suggesting either sunrise or sunset. As the car moves away from the camera at a slight angle, shifting slightly toward the center-left of the frame, it passes an explosion that sends smoke and flames into the air, with some black explosion debris on the ground to the right of the car. The camera, positioned at the car's level, uses a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. It moves quickly, first tracking the car from its rear-right side. As the car accelerates, the camera pans right to keep it in the frame, resulting in a noticeably unsteady tracking shot. The shot transitions into a wide shot, revealing more of the street, with the rear license plate of the car partially visible.",

    "Camera": "From an eye-level, level angle, the camera uses a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. The camera moves quickly, first tracking a car from its rear-right side. As the car accelerates, the camera pans right to keep it in the frame, resulting in a noticeably unsteady tracking shot.",
    "Subject": "A dark gray, four-door sedan, resembling a Ford Crown Victoria, is shown from a rear three-quarter perspective. The car appears to be an unmarked police vehicle, indicated by two small, flashing lights on the interior rear deck below the back window: a yellow one on the left and a blue one on the right, flashing alternately. The rear license plate is partially visible. The car drives slightly away from the camera on a paved road, near an explosion that contributes to the flames, dust and smoke around it.",
    "Motion": "A dark gray sedan drives forward on a paved road, moving away from the camera at a slight angle as it passes an explosion that sends smoke and flames into the air.",
    "Scene": "A dark gray sedan drives down a paved city street. To the left, a building is obscured by thick plumes of gray smoke and bright orange fire. The building on the right, and the distant building on the left, are both possibly made of stone, illuminated by warm, golden light, suggesting either sunrise or sunset. The car is in motion, passing by the fiery scene, with some black explosion debris on the ground to the right of the car.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a full shot of a dark gray sedan positioned in the center middle ground, driving away from the camera. In the middle ground to the left, an explosion creates a large plume of smoke and fire, while a building is visible at a distance on both sides of the road. As the car moves away, shifting slightly toward the center-left of the frame, the shot transitions into a wide shot, revealing more of the street. The camera is positioned at the car's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
