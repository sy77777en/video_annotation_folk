  "merged_caption": "The video uses a wide shot to frame three puppet-like human figures within a cozy, warmly lit living room. The man stands on the right side of the frame in the middle ground, with pale skin, a bald head with a fringe of dark hair, a mustache, and dressed in a brown suit over a white shirt with stripes and dark trousers. He leans forward to hold a large green and brown duffel bag in front of him and turns back to leave the frame from the right side in the middle of the video. The child, with light skin, short brown hair, wearing a yellow plaid shirt with rolled-up sleeves, blue jeans, and black shoes, is positioned in the center of the frame, also in the middle ground, facing away from the camera. The child waves his hand as the man leaves. The woman, with light skin and long brown hair, wearing a yellow dress, is partially visible on the left side of the frame, higher up on a staircase in the foreground. She is initially standing partway up the staircase, observing the interaction, and takes one step down the stairs before pausing and remaining in that position. The sofa, coffee table, and rug are arranged along the back wall in the middle ground, with the window and side table further in the background, with the window on the right. The camera is positioned above the subjects, looking down at an angle, which places the viewer at a higher vantage point relative to the child and the man on the right. This is a stop-motion video filmed from a static, high-angle, overhead perspective, maintaining a shallow depth of field with the focus set on the characters in the midground. The man and his bag exit the frame to the right, leaving the child in the center and the woman still on the stairs, maintaining their spatial positions.",

    "Subject": "The video features three puppet-like human figures with exaggerated facial features and stylized appearances. The man on the right has pale skin, a bald head with a fringe of dark hair, a mustache, and is dressed in a brown suit over a white shirt with stripes and dark trousers. He picks up a large green and brown duffel bag after the middle of the video. The child in the center has light skin, short brown hair, and wears a yellow plaid shirt with rolled-up sleeves, blue jeans, and black shoes, standing with their back to the viewer. The woman on the left, partially visible on a staircase, has light skin, long brown hair, and wears a yellow dress. The man and child are positioned near each other, suggesting interaction, while the woman observes from the stairs.",
    "Motion": "The man and the child stand closely, facing each other, with a duffel bag already on the ground between them. Midway through the video, the man leans forward, picks up the bag, and exits the frame to the right. The child remains in the same position but waves his hand as the man leaves. The woman on the left is initially standing partway up the staircase, observing the interaction. She takes one step down the stairs before pausing and remaining in that position.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set indoors in a cozy, warmly lit living room with wooden flooring and wallpapered walls featuring a subtle pattern. A colorful sofa with floral cushions is positioned against the wall, accompanied by a small wooden coffee table on a green rug. A framed landscape painting hangs above the sofa, adding to the room's homely atmosphere. A staircase with wooden railings descends into the room, suggesting a multi-level home. A window allows natural light to filter in, illuminating the space. The setting is detailed with a few pieces of furniture, including a side table with drawers. The overall ambiance is inviting and domestic, with a focus on the room's decor and layout.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
