  "merged_caption": "This wide, static scenery shot captures a street view from a street-level perspective, looking up an incline in Lisbon, Portugal. The street and its tram tracks begin at the bottom of the frame and recede toward the center-left background, flanked by multi-story buildings with yellow and stone facades and iron-railed balconies on the left and right. A street sign on a corner building reads \"RUA DA MADALENA.\" The camera remains stationary, filmed from an eye-level, level-angle perspective, using a deep focus to keep the entire street scene, from the trams to the buildings in the background, sharp and clear. In the middle ground, a vintage red tram is positioned in the center, while pedestrians are visible on the sidewalks and a person on a scooter moves toward the camera. The primary movement occurs in the foreground, where a white and yellow tram, decorated with small monkey illustrations and branded with \"MONKEY 47\" and \"carris\" with a logo in a yellow rectangle, enters from the right and passes by. The scene is set under an overcast sky, capturing the overall environment and atmosphere of daily life on this specific street.",

    "Subject": "This video captures a cityscape scenery shot of a bustling, narrow street in a historic European city. The view looks up a sloping road, defined by tram tracks and flanked on both sides by tall, traditional buildings with storefronts on the ground floor and balconies above. A vintage red tram is visible in the middle distance, while a white and yellow tram, decorated with small monkey illustrations, the brand \"MONKEY 47,\" and the \"carris\" brand with a logo in a yellow rectangle, moves across the foreground. Pedestrians can be seen on the sidewalks, and a person on a scooter drives up the street. There is no single main subject, as the camera's wide, static perspective is focused on capturing the overall environment and atmosphere of the location. The various elements—the iconic trams, the distinct architecture, and the flow of people—work together to create a comprehensive portrait of daily life on this specific street.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenery shot of a classic street in Lisbon, Portugal. The camera remains stationary, capturing the view up a narrow, hilly road lined with historic buildings and tram tracks. The primary motion in the scene is a white and yellow tram passing by in the foreground.",
    "Scene": "In a daytime, outdoor scene in Lisbon, Portugal, a narrow street with tram tracks is flanked by multi-story buildings with yellow and stone facades and iron-railed balconies. A street sign on a corner building reads \"RUA DA MADALENA\". In the distance, a red tram is visible, while a white and yellow tram with \"carris\" and \"MONKEY 47\" branding moves across the foreground. Pedestrians are on the sidewalks, and a scooter is on the street under an overcast sky.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
