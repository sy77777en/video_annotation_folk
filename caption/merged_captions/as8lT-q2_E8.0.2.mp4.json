  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot, where a silhouetted figure is thrown from the floor of the building to a position hanging outside the window in the center-left middle ground. Initially, a large screen displaying a luminous blue-green jellyfish occupies the center and right of the frame. The scene is set at night on the edge of a building, defined by a large screen visible on another building across from the characters. As the first figure moves out of view, the second silhouetted figure shifts to the center-left foreground due to the camera movement. The camera, initially at the subjects' level, follows this second figure forward and tilts down, transitioning to a high-angle perspective. The video features two people engaged in a physical altercation, both presented primarily as dark silhouettes. One individual is thrown through an opening where a glass pane used to be, now shattered with visible fragments around the frame. The person thrown does not fall but appears to be suspended, possibly held in place by the person on the ledge. The first individual, dressed in dark attire, is thrown and ends up hanging against the wall with his face looking upwards on an exterior ledge of a tall building. Inside, the other person is crouching and looking down at the individual on the ledge. The second person, who has short, light-colored hair and also wears dark clothing, is seen crouched at the ledge, looking down at the person hanging on the wall. In the final framing, the back of the second person's head occupies the bottom foreground, looking down. The first person is visible hanging outside the window in the center-left middle ground. The background reveals the space between a few buildings, with distant headlights visible far below on the street, emphasizing the height.",

    "Camera": "The video begins with a level-angle shot that transitions into a high-angle shot. The camera tilts downward and moves forward to capture a fight scene where one man is about to fall from a tall building. The shot starts with deep focus and transitions to a shallow depth of field, keeping the middle ground in focus as the camera moves.",

    "Scene": "The scene is set at night on the edge of a building, defined by a large screen visible on another building across from the characters. This screen displays a luminous, blue-green jellyfish with a distinct bell and long, flowing tentacles against a dark blue, particle-filled background. Two silhouetted figures move in front of this glowing display. The reflection of the screen can be seen in the glass of another building initially positioned to the left. The perspective shifts to look down between a few buildings, where blurry illuminated headlights of some vehicles are visible through a gap, suggesting a significant height above the street.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
