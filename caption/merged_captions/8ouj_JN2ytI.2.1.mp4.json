  "merged_caption": "The video presents a medium shot on a green football field during the daytime, under an overcast sky. In the right foreground, a bald man distinguished by a complex black mask covering his mouth and nose and wearing a thick brown leather shearling coat with a light-colored fur collar stands, holding a small microphone towards a kneeling, middle-aged man with graying dark hair, positioned in the bottom center foreground. The kneeling man, dressed in a light-blue collared shirt, a dark-grey V-neck sweater vest, and a dark jacket draped over his shoulders, looks upward at the masked man. The masked man, initially still, leans slightly forward and raises the microphone in his left hand to his mask area, speaking into it before extending this hand towards the kneeling man to speak. To the left and slightly behind the kneeling man, in the middle ground, stands another bald man with a light skin tone, wearing a dark tactical vest over a brown jacket, a red scarf around his neck, and holding a large black rifle. Further to the far left, another armed man with dark hair and a beard, dressed in a dark tactical vest laden with ammunition pouches over a dark shirt and a deep red scarf around his neck, also holds a rifle. Several other men in rugged, military-style attire, some armed, are visible in the middle ground, distributed around these central figures. The background features a large scoreboard with \"Doritos\" and \"UPMC\" logos at the top center and top left, while stadium bleachers filled with spectators in yellow occupy only the top right background. Filmed from an eye-level, level angle, the camera uses a shallow depth of field to focus on the characters in the foreground and performs a smooth, minor upward tilt.",

    "Motion": "The kneeling man looks upward at the masked man standing over him. The masked man, initially still, leans slightly forward and raises the small microphone in his left hand to his mask area. He then extends this hand, holding the microphone, towards the kneeling man. The masked man initially speaks into the microphone himself before passing it to the kneeling man to speak. Other armed men in the scene remain largely stationary.",
    "Scene": "The scene takes place outdoors on a green football field during the daytime, under an overcast sky. In the background, a large scoreboard displays \"Doritos\" and \"UPMC\" logos, with stadium bleachers filled with spectators visible further back. Several men in military-style attire, some armed, are present on the field. One man, wearing a distinctive mask and a brown leather coat with a fur collar, stands over another man who is kneeling and dressed in civilian clothes.",
    "Spatial": "The video presents a medium shot. In the right foreground, a masked man in a shearling coat stands, holding a device towards a kneeling man positioned in the bottom center foreground. To the left and slightly behind the kneeling man, in the middle ground, stands a bald man in tactical gear. Further to the far left, another armed man with a beard is also in the middle ground. Several other armed men are visible in the middle ground, distributed around these central figures. The background features a large scoreboard with \"Doritos\" and \"UPMC\" logos at the top center and top left, while stadium bleachers filled with spectators in yellow occupy only the top right background. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
