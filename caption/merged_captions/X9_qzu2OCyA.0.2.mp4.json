  "merged_caption": "From a head-mounted camera perspective, the video begins with a full shot of a woman with long, dark brown hair, wearing a black ski helmet, large ski goggles with reflective blue lenses, and a black neck gaiter. She is dressed in a red and grey varsity-style jacket with a white letter \"C\" on the chest and black ski pants, using yellow ski poles and red and black skis. Positioned in the center of the frame, with her skis and the snow directly below, she glides down a snowy slope in a terrain park on a sunny day under a clear blue sky. As she approaches a large snow ramp marked with an \"O'NEILL\" logo, the camera's viewpoint rapidly inverts as she launches off, performing a backflip that inverts her against the sky. The camera, mounted on her helmet, captures this point-of-view shot with a speed ramp effect, shifting between fast and slow motion. The skier remains centered but is now upside down, with the vast blue sky filling the background. As she executes a smooth, high-difficulty 360-degree roll, the camera moves to an overhead level and rotates with her, transitioning through an upside-down high angle and a worm's eye view. The snowy terrain park below, including other ramps with \"MARKER\" and \"LIVIGNO\" branding and distant ski lifts, reappears at the bottom of the frame. The camera returns to a level angle as she completes the rotation and descends toward the landing area below. The shot is characterized by noticeable fisheye distortion and maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field throughout the entire maneuver. The groomed white snow covers the entire area, with other people visible on the slopes in the distance.",

    "Camera": "This point-of-view shot is captured by a camera mounted on the skier's helmet, leading her from the front and looking down. The video features a speed ramp effect, shifting between fast and slow motion. The camera begins at a high, eye-level angle before the skier launches into the air. As she executes a smooth, high-difficulty 360-degree roll, the camera moves to an overhead level and rotates with her, transitioning through an upside-down high angle and a worm's eye view before returning to a level angle. The shot is characterized by noticeable fisheye distortion and maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field throughout the entire maneuver.",
    "Subject": "A woman with long, dark brown hair is shown skiing from a helmet-mounted camera, providing a first-person perspective of the experience. She wears a black ski helmet, large ski goggles with reflective blue lenses, and a black neck gaiter. Her attire includes a red and grey varsity-style jacket with a white letter \"C\" on the chest and black ski pants. She uses yellow ski poles and is on red and black skis. The video captures her performing an aerial maneuver, showing her upside down against a clear blue sky.",
    "Motion": "Filmed from a helmet-mounted camera, a skier glides down a snowy slope, already in motion. She approaches a large snow ramp and launches off, performing a backflip that inverts her against the clear blue sky. As she completes the rotation, she descends toward the landing area below.",
    "Scene": "A locked-on POV shot, where the camera is mounted to an object, keeps the perspective fixed as a skier approaches a large jump in a snowy terrain park. The scene is set on a sunny day under a clear blue sky, with distant snow-capped mountains and ski lifts visible across the landscape. As the skier launches into the air from a large, white snow ramp, the world dramatically rotates around the fixed viewpoint, revealing the blue sky and then the ground below. The ramp, marked with an \"O'NEILL\" logo, and other snow features with \"MARKER\" and \"LIVIGNO\" branding, become visible as the perspective inverts and then rights itself before landing. The groomed white snow covers the entire area, with other people visible on the slopes in the distance.",
    "Spatial": "From a head-mounted camera perspective, the video begins with a full shot of the skier positioned in the center of the frame, with their skis and the snow directly below them as part of the background. As the skier launches from a large white ramp in the foreground, the camera's viewpoint rapidly inverts. The skier remains centered but is now upside down, with the vast blue sky filling the background. The camera continues its 360-degree rotation with the skier, causing the snowy terrain park below, which includes other ramps and distant ski lifts, to reappear at the bottom of the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
