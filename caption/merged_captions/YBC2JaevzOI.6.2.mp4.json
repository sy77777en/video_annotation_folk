  "merged_caption": "The video captures a nighttime cityscape with a wide shot, focusing on an empty road and its surroundings. The road extends from the lower right corner of the foreground, curving gently toward the center and receding into the background, occupying the foreground and middle ground. Low concrete barriers run along both sides of the road, with the left barrier and adjacent grassy area positioned in the bottom left foreground. Streetlights begin in the middle ground on the left side of the road and continue into the background, creating a line of illuminated pools that emphasize the road’s depth. A speed limit sign with a white background and black markings is visible on the right side of the road, positioned in the middle ground near the right edge of the frame. The camera is positioned above the road at eye level, providing a clear, expansive view of the scene. This is a fixed, slightly unsteady shot filmed from an eye-level, level angle. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the entire scene in sharp view. The video shows a quiet, empty road at night, illuminated by a series of streetlights. The scene is dark and still, with no visible activity or motion. The darkness of the sky and the absence of vehicles or pedestrians emphasize the stillness and solitude of the urban environment, while the gentle curve of the road and the subtle glow from the lamps create a sense of depth and calm. The sky is completely black, with no visible stars or clouds, and the overall environment appears still, with no vehicles or pedestrians present. The road surface is smooth and slightly reflective under the streetlights, and there are no notable overlays or visual effects present in the video. There is no main subject in this video, as the focus is on capturing the tranquil atmosphere and expansive emptiness of the city at night.",

    "Subject": "The video is a nighttime cityscape scenery shot, featuring a quiet, empty road illuminated by a series of evenly spaced streetlights that cast pools of light onto the pavement and sidewalk. The darkness of the sky and the absence of vehicles or pedestrians emphasize the stillness and solitude of the urban environment, while the gentle curve of the road and the subtle glow from the lamps create a sense of depth and calm.

    "Scene": "The video shows a quiet, empty road at night, bordered by low concrete barriers on both sides. On the side nearest to the camera, there is a grassy area situated along the inside of the barrier. The scene is illuminated by a series of evenly spaced streetlights that cast pools of white light onto the wide asphalt road, creating a stark contrast with the surrounding darkness. A speed limit sign with a white background and black markings is visible on the right side of the road, mounted on a slender pole. The sky is completely black, with no visible stars or clouds, and the overall environment appears still, with no vehicles or pedestrians present. The road surface is smooth and slightly reflective under the streetlights, and there are no notable overlays or visual effects present in the video.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
