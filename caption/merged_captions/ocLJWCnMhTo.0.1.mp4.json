  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a bird's-eye view, looking straight down at a black-and-white checkered floor that fills the frame. A figure in a white short-sleeved shirt is positioned at the bottom of the frame, while a second figure is partially visible at the top right. A reflective silver disc with a glowing golden ring is located in the center of the shot, with a metallic chair in the top left. The camera's perspective begins with a direct overhead view and then performs a shaky, arcing crane-up, transitioning the perspective to an upside-down level angle at hip level. As the camera moves, a red, ribbon-like stream of light flows from one figure to another across the checkered floor. The two figures have a raised-hand gesture at chest level, which is frozen in place. The perspective gradually shifts, causing the entire scene to rotate until it becomes completely inverted. In the final upside-down composition, the checkered floor occupies the top of the frame, and the figure initially at the bottom is now seen inverted at the top. The central disc now appears to hang from the \"ceiling,\" and a red stream of light extends between the two figures. The camera's position changes from being high above the subjects to the subjects' level and at an inverted angle. The scene takes place in an indoor room with walls that are a mix of white and green tiles, with a couple of framed pictures visible. The footage has a grainy, low-fidelity aesthetic. The light-skinned figure has short blond hair, and the other has darker skin, visible only from the shoulders down, wearing a silver wrist accessory similar to a watch strap. A deep focus is maintained throughout, keeping the entire scene sharp.",

    "Camera": "This unsteady shot begins with a bird's-eye view from eye level. The camera then performs a shaky, arcing crane-up, which transitions the perspective to an upside-down level angle at hip level. A deep focus is maintained throughout, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "The scene begins with a standard overhead view that gradually shifts to an inverted perspective. On the black-and-white checkered floor, two figures in white short-sleeved shirts are visible: one is light-skinned with short blond hair, and the other has darker skin, visible only from the shoulders down, wearing a silver wrist accessory similar to a watch strap. At the center of the composition is a reflective silver disc, reminiscent of a mirror, surrounded by a glowing golden light effect. A red, ribbon-like stream of light flows between the two figures.",
    "Motion": "The camera's perspective begins with a direct overhead view and then cranes up, shifting to an inverted view of the scene. As the camera moves, a red, ribbon-like stream of light flows from one figure to another across the checkered floor. The two figures have a raised-hand gesture at chest level, which is frozen in place.",
    "Scene": "The scene takes place in an indoor room with a distinctive black and white checkerboard floor, beginning as an overhead view and craning up into an inverted perspective. The walls are a mix of white and green tiles, with a couple of framed pictures visible. Metallic chairs are present in the space. A reflective silver disc resembling a mirror is encircled by a glowing golden ring of light. Figures in white short-sleeved shirts are positioned around the room. A red ribbon-like flow of light extends between the figures. The footage has a grainy, low-fidelity aesthetic.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
