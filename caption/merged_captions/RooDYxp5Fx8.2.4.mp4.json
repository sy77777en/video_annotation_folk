  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot from an eye-level perspective, capturing a quiet urban street in Japan under a bright blue sky with scattered white clouds. Initially, a person is in the middle ground on the left, walking away from the camera along a wide sidewalk paved with gray and white tiles and marked with yellow tactile strips. Modern buildings with a brick base and reflective windows occupy the left side of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground. A green pedestrian overpass with visibly rusted stairs is positioned in the right-center middle ground, spanning a multi-lane asphalt road that fills the center and right portions of the scene. A blue and white city bus stop sign stands in the right foreground, while a median with green shrubbery is situated in the middle of the wide road. The camera, in a first-person POV shot, moves forward along the sidewalk while panning slowly to the right, revealing more of the street and the pedestrian overpass. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking, and a deep focus keeps the entire street scene, from the pedestrian on the left to the buildings across the road, sharp and clear. As the camera moves, the person and the bus stop exit the frame, while the overpass shifts to become the central element in the middle ground. This movement reveals more of the road and a green median to the right. Throughout the shot, the background, featuring distant buildings and a sky with fluffy white clouds, remains at the top of the frame. The focus is on the overall environment and the tranquil, sunny atmosphere of the urban landscape, emphasizing the scale of the street and architecture over any single element.",

    "Camera": "This eye-level, level-angle shot moves forward along a sidewalk while panning right to reveal more of the street and the pedestrian overpass. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking. A deep focus keeps the entire street scene, from the pedestrian on the left to the buildings across the road, sharp and clear.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a cityscape scenery shot of a quiet urban street in Japan under a bright blue sky with scattered white clouds. The camera pans slowly to the right, revealing a wide, paved sidewalk next to a multi-lane road, which features a green belt in the middle, enhancing the scenic quality of the street. A large, green pedestrian overpass with noticeably rusted stairs spans the road. On the left, modern buildings line the street, where a single person walks away from the camera, while a blue city bus stop sign stands on the right. There is no main subject in this video; the focus is instead on the overall environment and the tranquil, sunny atmosphere of the urban landscape, emphasizing the scale of the street and architecture over any single element.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenery shot of a quiet city street in Japan under a bright blue sky. The camera pans slowly to the right, revealing a wide road, a green pedestrian overpass with rusted stairs, and a city bus stop. A person is seen walking along the sidewalk on the left.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves along a wide sidewalk in a Japanese city on a bright, sunny day. On the left, a person walks past a modern building with a brick base and reflective windows. The sidewalk is paved with gray and white tiles and marked with yellow tactile strips. Directly ahead, a green pedestrian overpass with visibly rusted stairs spans a multi-lane asphalt road. To the right, a blue and white city bus stop stands at the edge of the sidewalk, while a median with green shrubbery is situated in the middle of the wide road. The sky is a vibrant blue with fluffy white clouds.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
