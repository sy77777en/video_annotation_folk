  "merged_caption": "This wide shot presents a scene with several floating structures set against a colorful, banded sky in the background, transitioning from light pink at the top to a deep red at the bottom. Two tall, vertical stone pillars occupy the center of the frame, one on the left and one on the right. A small, white, pixelated creature with a small, raised feature on its head, resembling a hat or a tuft of hair, is positioned at the top center on the highest point of the left pillar. Another similar white creature is located in the center of the frame, partially visible within a recess of the same left pillar, while a third stands on a ledge to the right of center on the right pillar. In the top right corner, a separate, broken, dark platform hovers. The scene is set in an outdoor, pixel-art environment with patches of green grass, vines, and small red flowers adorning some of the platforms. The three small, white, pixelated creatures are mostly stationary on their respective platforms and ledges, but the boxy creature actively jumps from one platform to another, and the creature on top moves from side to side. This is a side-scrolling shot where the camera smoothly tracks the small, white character, incorporating a subtle vertical up and down movement to effectively follow its actions as it moves from left to right. The video features several small, white, pixelated creatures with simple, blocky forms, rendered in a minimalist pixel art style, lacking detailed facial features or limbs. Small, white, bird-like characters are positioned on various ledges of the pillars.",

One creature, positioned on a high platform, is distinguished by a small, raised feature on its head, resembling a hat or a tuft of hair. Another similar white creature is partially visible inside a recess in a vertical, grassy structure. A third creature, identical in its simple white form to the second, stands on a ledge on a separate vertical structure.

    "Scene": "A gaming video with a third-person side point of view, where the camera is positioned to the side of the character. The scene is set in an outdoor, pixel-art environment against a stylized sky composed of horizontal bands of color, transitioning from light pink at the top to a deep red at the bottom. Several tall, vertical pillars made of grey, blocky stone float in the space. Patches of green grass, vines, and small red flowers adorn some of the platforms. In the upper right, a separate, darker, broken platform hovers. Small, white, bird-like characters are positioned on various ledges of the pillars.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
