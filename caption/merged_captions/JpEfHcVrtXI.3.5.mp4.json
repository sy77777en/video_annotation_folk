  "merged_caption": "The video is a wide shot, with the camera positioned above the subjects in a dimly lit indoor room with dark wooden plank flooring. The camera is at eye level, maintaining a level angle and employing deep focus with a large depth of field. It exhibits minor, very smooth movement, panning from left to right. In the center-top middle ground, a pair of legs clad in dark pants and shoes hangs motionlessly from the ceiling, suggesting a person is suspended. Directly beneath, in the center middle ground, a small, child-like figure in a bright yellow hooded raincoat is initially positioned to the left of a small, light brown wooden chair. The figure is seen pulling the chair slightly further to the right, turning halfway to the left, and ultimately facing towards the left. Both the figure and chair remain in the middle ground during this movement. A single dark shoe and a white piece of paper lie on the floor in the center middle ground near the chair's initial position. A roll of white toilet paper is seen in the middle-left middle ground, rolling towards the left edge of the frame. A bare mattress lies on the floor against the dark wall on the left in the middle ground, while a wooden door with an eye-like design is visible on the right in the middle ground. Some pipes are visible in the background. Scattered wooden planks are visible throughout the room.",

    "Subject": "The video shows a dimly lit room where a pair of legs, clad in dark pants and dark shoes, hangs motionlessly from the middle top of the frame, suggesting a hanging person. Directly beneath these suspended legs, a small, child-like figure wearing a bright yellow hooded raincoat is attempting to move a simple wooden chair. A single dark shoe lies on the floor near the chair. Additionally, a roll of paper towels is seen on the floor, rolling towards the left side of the frame, located in the middle left.",
    "Motion": "In a dimly lit room with wooden floors and a door on the right, a pair of legs hang from the ceiling, suggesting a person is suspended. A small, child-like figure in a bright yellow hooded raincoat is seen pulling a wooden chair. Initially facing away from the camera, the figure moves to the right, then pulls the chair while turning halfway to the left, ultimately facing towards the left. The chair remains in the center of the frame throughout the scene, with the figure consistently holding onto it.",
    "Scene": "A third-person 3D game video shows a dimly lit indoor room with dark wooden plank flooring. A single spotlight illuminates the center, where a pair of legs in dark pants and shoes hangs from above. Directly beneath, a small, light brown wooden chair stands, with a small figure in a yellow raincoat initially standing beside it and then attempting to pull it towards the right side. To the left, a bare mattress lies on the floor against the dark wall, and a roll of white toilet paper moves from the middle of the room to the left side. Scattered wooden planks are visible throughout the room. Near the chair, a dark slipper and a white piece of paper are visible on the floor. The background walls are dark, with some visible pipes and a wooden door with an eye-like design on the right.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
