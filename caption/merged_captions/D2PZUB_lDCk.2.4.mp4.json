  "merged_caption": "A dynamic, wavy surface composed of countless tiny, shimmering golden particles stretches across the bottom of the scene, set against a dark, deep-brown background. A bright, horizontal light source serves as a central horizon, from which numerous thin, vertical beams of golden light continuously rise upwards. Throughout the scene, a multitude of smaller, floating specks of golden light drift and sparkle, also moving upwards, contributing to an overall effect of ascending light. The shimmering golden surface undulates in slow, wave-like motions, creating the appearance of a digital sea or landscape. The bright, radiant light emanates from the center of this textured ground, enhancing the luminous environment. The camera remains completely static throughout the video, offering a direct view of this captivating display.",

    "Subject": "This abstract animation features a dark, deep-brown background filled with glowing golden elements. At the bottom, a dynamic, wavy surface is composed of countless tiny, shimmering golden particles, creating the appearance of a digital sea or landscape. From a bright, horizontal light source at the horizon of this surface, numerous thin, vertical beams of golden light rise upwards. These beams are accompanied by a multitude of smaller, floating specks of golden light that drift and sparkle throughout the space, with all moving upwards.",
    "Motion": "A wavy surface of shimmering golden particles gently undulates at the bottom of the frame. From a bright light source at the horizon, numerous thin, vertical beams of golden light continuously rise upwards. Throughout the scene, a multitude of smaller, sparkling golden specks also float and drift upwards, contributing to an overall effect of ascending light.",
    "Scene": "In an abstract digital landscape against a dark background, a shimmering golden surface made of countless tiny particles undulates in slow, wave-like motions. A bright, radiant light emanates from the center of this textured ground. From this glowing base, thin, vertical beams of golden light and dotted lines continuously ascend toward the top. Throughout the scene, numerous small, sparkling particles drift and float, rising with the light beams, creating a dynamic and luminous environment.",
    "Spatial": "A dynamic, wavy surface composed of golden particles stretches across the bottom of the scene. A bright, horizontal light source serves as a central horizon, from which numerous thin, vertical beams of light and smaller floating particles continuously rise upwards, filling the scene. The camera remains stationary, offering a direct view of the captivating display."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
