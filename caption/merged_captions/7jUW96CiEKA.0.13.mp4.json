  "merged_caption": "This is an extreme wide shot capturing a river landscape. The river flows from the middle ground near the center right, meandering towards the bottom foreground. Dense green trees and bushes dominate the left foreground and middle ground, while the right foreground and middle ground consist of sandy banks and patches of grass. A densely wooded hillside occupies the background across the upper portion of the frame. The camera maintains a static position, slightly elevated relative to the river level, approximately at the height of a second floor, with a level angle looking straight ahead. It employs deep focus, maintaining clarity across the entire scene, which includes a river landscape with trees and wildlife. In this serene natural setting, three elephants are partially immersed in the river near a lush riverbank, while another elephant is positioned further up the bank, partially concealed by the bushes. The background is filled with greenery and trees, creating a tranquil atmosphere. The river flows gently, reflecting the light of the setting sun, as the elephants stand and graze near the water's edge. The video depicts an outdoor setting in a serene, natural environment during what appears to be early morning or late afternoon, characterized by soft, diffused lighting. The scene features a tranquil river meandering through a lush landscape, bordered by dense greenery and trees with varied foliage. On the left side of the riverbank, trees are positioned closer to the camera, adding to the depth of the scene. The river's surface reflects the muted sky, creating a gentle contrast with the surrounding earthy tones. The overall atmosphere is calm and undisturbed, with no visible human presence or structures.",

    "Camera": "The video features a static camera positioned at an overhead level, approximately at the height of a second floor, with a level angle looking straight ahead. It employs deep focus, maintaining clarity across the entire scene, which includes a river landscape with trees and wildlife.",
    "Subject": "The video is a landscape scenery shot, focusing on a serene natural environment. It captures a tranquil river meandering through a lush, green area with dense foliage and scattered trees. The atmosphere is calm, with soft lighting suggesting early morning or late afternoon. The emphasis is on the overall environment and the peaceful ambiance, rather than any specific object or subject. The presence of animals, such as elephants, adds to the natural setting but does not dominate the scene, allowing the viewer to appreciate the scale and beauty of the landscape.",

The river's surface reflects the muted sky, creating a gentle contrast with the surrounding earthy tones. The terrain is slightly uneven, with patches of grass and sandy banks. In the background, a line of trees and shrubs further enhances the scene's depth, while a few animals are visible near the water, blending harmoniously with the environment. The overall atmosphere is calm and undisturbed, with no visible human presence or structures.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
