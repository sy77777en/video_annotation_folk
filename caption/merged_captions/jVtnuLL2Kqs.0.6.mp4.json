  "merged_caption": "This is a dynamic scenery shot of London on a clear day, captured from a stone embankment along the River Thames. The camera is positioned at eye level, providing a varied perspective of the scene. The video begins with a view from the south bank, featuring a stone embankment running along the bottom of the frame, with a series of ornate black lampposts positioned at intervals. The River Thames occupies the middle ground, stretching across the lower half of the scene. Tower Bridge, with its two grand towers and blue suspension cables, spans the river in the center of the middle ground, dominating the frame. The camera moves forward, pans left, and shifts right, capturing the bridge and its surroundings with fluid motion. In the background, the historic Tower of London is visible on the far riverbank to the left. A string of lights initially extends from the top center towards the right midground, then shifts from the top left towards the right. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene from the foreground walkway to the distant Tower Bridge sharp. The composition lacks a single main subject, as its purpose is to capture the expansive scale and atmosphere of this famous urban landscape, focusing on the relationship between the architectural landmarks and the river rather than any individual element. A white watermark is located in the bottom right corner.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
