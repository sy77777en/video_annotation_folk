  "merged_caption": "In an extreme wide shot, the scene is framed from a varying Dutch high angle, with the horizon initially running from the top center to the bottom left, but nearly disappearing at the top left by the end of the video. A massive sand dune dominates the foreground and right side of the frame. The camera glides forward over vast desert dunes, transitioning from a level angle to a high angle, framed with a varying Dutch angle as it simultaneously trucks and rolls counterclockwise in a complex maneuver. The landscape is composed of immense, rolling sand dunes with sharp ridges and smooth, golden-brown slopes. The sun is a bright, hazy orb in a pale yellow sky, illuminating the scene with a warm, diffused light. In the middle ground, two groups of small, dark figures, appearing to be a mix of people and camels, are positioned along the crest of a distant dune; at the end of the video, one group is in the center and the other is to the left of it. These figures appear as silhouettes against the bright, hazy sky, and due to the significant distance and atmospheric conditions, no individual details such as clothing or specific actions can be discerned. The camera's low, fast movement along the side of a dune creates a dynamic perspective of the expansive, arid environment. The bright, hazy sun appears in the top left background in the middle of the video but goes out of frame from the top as the camera moves. In the middle ground, the two groups of dark silhouette figures, comprising people and camels, move slowly to the left, maintaining their positions along the crest of the dune. A deep focus keeps the entire expansive landscape sharp.",

    "Camera": "From an overhead perspective, the camera moves forward over vast desert dunes. The shot transitions from a level angle to a high angle, framed with a varying Dutch angle as the camera simultaneously trucks and rolls counterclockwise in a complex maneuver. A deep focus keeps the entire expansive landscape sharp.",
    "Subject": "Two groups of small, dark figures, appearing to be a mix of people and camels, are visible in the distance. They are positioned along the crest of a vast sand dune, appearing as silhouettes against the bright, hazy sky. Due to the significant distance and atmospheric conditions, no individual details such as clothing or specific actions can be discerned.",
    "Motion": "The camera glides forward at a varying dutched high angle, flying low over the crests and valleys of vast sand dunes in a desert. In the middle ground, two groups of dark silhouette figures, comprising people and camels, move slowly to the left.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures a swift, varying Dutch high angle flight across a vast desert. The landscape is composed of immense, rolling sand dunes with sharp ridges and smooth, golden-brown slopes. The sun is a bright, hazy orb in a pale yellow sky, illuminating the scene with a warm, diffused light. In the distance, two groups of small, dark figures consisting of people and camels can be seen traversing on the sand plain. The camera's low, fast movement along the side of a dune creates a dynamic perspective of the expansive, arid environment.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
