  "merged_caption": "In an extreme wide shot from a top-down aerial perspective, a white semi-trailer truck is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. The truck, consisting of a cab and a long, rectangular trailer, is stationary on a paved road that runs diagonally from the top left to the bottom right of the scene. The road, marked with a double yellow center line and white dashed lane lines, cuts through a vast, sandy, and arid landscape with sparse vegetation. The scene is overlaid with several light-colored crosshair markings, resembling a surveillance or targeting display. The camera smoothly zooms out and rolls counterclockwise, beginning out of focus, then shifting focus to keep the truck sharp while the surrounding desert landscape remains consistently blurred. The footage has a grainy, sepia-toned filter, enhancing the arid desert atmosphere. The camera tracks the truck, keeping it centered, as the surrounding desert landscape stretches out on both sides of the road. There is no movement in the video, emphasizing the stillness of the scene.",

    "Camera": "From an aerial, bird's-eye view, the camera smoothly zooms out and rolls counterclockwise. The scene begins out of focus, then the focus shifts to keep the truck sharp while the surrounding desert landscape remains consistently blurred.",
    "Subject": "From a top-down aerial perspective with an overlaid crosshair graphic, a white semi-trailer truck is stationary on a four-lane paved road. The truck, consisting of a cab and a long, rectangular trailer, is positioned in the center of the frame. The road, marked with a double yellow center line and white dashed lane lines, cuts through a vast, sandy, and arid landscape.",
    "Motion": "From a top-down aerial perspective, a semi-trailer truck remains stationary on a paved road that runs through a desert landscape. There is no movement in the video.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures a top-down view of a white semi-trailer truck that appears stationary on a paved highway cutting diagonally across a vast, arid desert. The landscape is a light brown, sandy terrain with sparse vegetation. The dark asphalt road features white dashed lane markings and a double yellow line in the center. The footage has a grainy, sepia-toned filter, and the scene is overlaid with several light-colored crosshair markings, resembling a surveillance or targeting display.",
    "Spatial": "In an extreme wide shot from a top-down aerial perspective, a white semi-trailer truck is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. The truck is on a paved road that runs diagonally from the top left to the bottom right of the scene. The camera tracks the truck, keeping it centered, as the surrounding desert landscape stretches out on both sides of the road. The scene is viewed through a graphic overlay of several crosshairs distributed across the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
