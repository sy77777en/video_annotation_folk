  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a vintage-style map of Germany spread out on a wooden desk, positioned in the center of the frame. A grey and red model train car occupies the left side, extending from the foreground to the middle ground. In the background, a grey vintage typewriter sits at the top center, and a small brown book is at the top right. A telephone receiver is visible in the bottom-left foreground. The camera, positioned high above the scene, moves forward and downward simultaneously, transitioning from eye level to hip level as it approaches the map. As the camera moves, it pans slightly to the left, shifting focus from a deep focus to a shallow depth of field, sharpening the view on three silver-colored, metallic architectural models placed on the map. These models represent the \"German Stadium,\" \"Congress Hall,\" and \"Zeppelin Field,\" each marked with a small black sign with white text. In the final frame, the \"German Stadium\" model, a U-shaped representation with detailed tiered seating visible inside, is in the center foreground. The \"Congress Hall\" model, a C-shaped structure, is in the middle ground to the right, and the \"Zeppelin Field\" model, a long, rectangular structure, is in the middle ground to the left, all viewed from the same high-angle perspective. The models and other objects on the desk remain stationary throughout the shot. A credit in the bottom-left corner reads, \"David Rumsey Map Collection, David Rumsey Map Center, Stanford Libraries.\" The dimly lit setting enhances the vintage aesthetic of the scene, with the map and objects creating a cohesive historical tableau.",

    "Camera": "From a high angle, the camera moves forward and down, transitioning from eye level to hip level as it approaches a map on a table. The shot begins and ends with a slight pan to the left. Initially, the scene is in deep focus, but as the camera gets closer, the focus shifts to a shallow depth of field, sharpening the German Stadium model and its label while blurring the background.",
    "Subject": "A vintage-style map of Germany is spread out on a wooden desk, accompanied by a grey and red model train car on the left, a grey vintage typewriter, and a small brown book in the background. The view focuses on the center of the map, which features three silver-colored, metallic architectural models, each marked with a small black sign with white text. The most prominent model, in the foreground, is a U-shaped representation of the \"German Stadium,\" with detailed tiered seating visible inside. Positioned further behind and to the right of the stadium is a C-shaped model of the \"Congress Hall,\" and to the left and also further behind the stadium is a long, rectangular model of the \"Zeppelin Field\" grandstand.",
    "Motion": "The camera moves downward and forward towards a map of Germany, focusing on three silver architectural models representing the German Stadium, Congress Hall, and Zeppelin Field. The models and other objects on the desk remain stationary throughout the shot.",
    "Scene": "In a dimly lit setting, a vintage map of Europe is laid out on a wooden desk. Surrounding the map are a vintage typewriter, a small book, a model train car, and the receiver of an old telephone. Placed directly on the map are three metallic architectural models: a long, rectangular structure; a large, U-shaped stadium; and a C-shaped building. Physical signs accompany these models, identifying them as \"Zeppelin Field,\" \"German Stadium,\" and \"Congress Hall.\" A credit in the bottom-left corner reads, \"David Rumsey Map Collection, David Rumsey Map Center, Stanford Libraries.\"",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
