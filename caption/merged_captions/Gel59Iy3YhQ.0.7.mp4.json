  "merged_caption": "A small, glowing humanoid creature with green skin and large, pointed ears is centered on the screen, wearing a red helmet and holding a hammer that emits a bright, fiery orange-and-yellow glow, enveloping its upper body. The scene is set within dark, stone-block cavern walls constructed from rough, rectangular stone blocks in shades of brown and purple, with a sandy dirt floor below. The creature is actively digging downward in search of gems and treasures, surrounded by smaller gems and treasures, including cyan and purple ones, at its feet. The camera, in a smooth, side-view, tracks the player's avatar, moving downward intermittently as the character falls. The scene is dimly lit, with the primary illumination coming from the bright, flickering, fiery light source emanating from the character in the center. User interface elements are overlaid: health and resource bars in the top left, a mini-map and currency display in the top right, control icons in the bottom left, and an inventory bar at the bottom center containing various collected ores and gems. The camera continues to follow the creature's descent, capturing the dynamic motion as it digs deeper into the underground cavern, revealing more of the dark, treasure-laden environment.",

    "Camera": "This is a video game scene with a smooth, side-view camera that tracks the player's avatar, moving downward intermittently as the character falls.",
    "Subject": "A small, green-skinned humanoid creature with large, pointed ears stands at the center, wearing a red helmet. It holds a hammer that emits a bright, fiery orange-and-yellow glow, enveloping its upper body. To the upper right, variously colored gems are visible, including cyan and purple ones. At the feet of the glowing central character lie gems and treasures.",
    "Motion": "The small, green-skinned humanoid creature is actively digging downward in search of gems and treasures, while a bright, fiery glow emanates from the hammer it is holding.",
    "Scene": "In a side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene in profile, the setting is a dark, underground cavern. The walls are constructed from rough, rectangular stone blocks in shades of brown and purple, with a sandy dirt floor below. The scene is dimly lit, with the primary illumination coming from a bright, flickering, fiery light source emanating from a character in the center. Several smaller gems and treasures are visible in the surrounding darkness. Overlays are present on the screen: the top left corner displays health and resource bars; the top right shows currency, a settings icon, and a mini-map; the bottom left features control icons for tools and weapons; and the bottom center contains an inventory bar with various collected ores and gems.",
    "Spatial": "A small, glowing humanoid creature is centered on the screen, surrounded by smaller gems and treasures. The scene is set within dark, stone-block cavern walls. User interface elements are overlaid: health and resource bars in the top left, a mini-map and currency display in the top right, control icons in the bottom left, and an inventory bar at the bottom center.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
