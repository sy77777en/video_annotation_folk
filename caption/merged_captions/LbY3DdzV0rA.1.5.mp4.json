  "merged_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a landscape, with the focus on the scenery rather than a specific subject. From a high-elevation, level-angle perspective, a rocky cliff edge occupies the foreground at the bottom of the frame. The vast, layered canyon fills the middle ground across the lower half of the composition, extending into the background. Heavy, dark clouds dominate the top half of the frame. In the middle ground, sheets of rain are visible falling from the clouds into the canyon, primarily in the center and left portions of the scene. The time-lapse captures the rapid movement of the clouds and rain across the expansive landscape, creating a dynamic interplay of light and shadow over the static canyon formations. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the entire vast landscape sharp. It performs a slow, smooth pan from left to right, revealing more of the canyon and the dramatic storm clouds. The scene is dominated by a powerful storm, with heavy, dark clouds filling the upper frame and casting deep shadows across the reddish-brown rock formations. Visible sheets of rain fall from the clouds into the depths of the canyon, while distant areas are illuminated by shafts of sunlight, creating a high-contrast and moody atmosphere. The rapid movement of the clouds and rain creates a dynamic scene, with shifting light and shadow over the immense landscape. The sheer size and grandeur of the landscape are emphasized by the expansive view and the dynamic interplay of light and shadow. The camera pans to the right, enhancing the sense of movement and scale within the scene.",

    "Camera": "This time-lapse video is captured from a high elevation on a mountaintop, looking out at a level angle. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the entire vast landscape sharp. It performs a slow, smooth pan from left to right, revealing more of the canyon and the dramatic storm clouds.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a dramatic landscape scenery shot from a horizontal perspective, capturing a vast, layered canyon under a turbulent sky. The scene is dominated by a powerful storm, with heavy, dark clouds filling the upper frame and casting deep shadows across the reddish-brown rock formations. Visible sheets of rain fall from the clouds into the depths of the canyon, while distant areas are illuminated by shafts of sunlight, creating a high-contrast and moody atmosphere. There is no main subject in this shot; the focus is instead on the immense scale of the natural environment and the powerful, atmospheric weather conditions unfolding within it. The sheer size and grandeur of the landscape are emphasized by the expansive view and the dynamic interplay of light and shadow.",
    "Motion": "This is a dramatic time-lapse video of a storm moving over the Grand Canyon. Heavy, dark clouds churn and roll rapidly across the sky. Sheets of rain can be seen falling in the distance, sweeping across the vast canyon landscape.",
    "Scene": "A time-lapse captures a dramatic storm moving across the Grand Canyon. From a level angle, the view looks out over the vast expanse of layered, reddish-brown rock formations and buttes. The sky is filled with heavy, dark grey clouds, from which sheets of rain fall into the canyon in the distance. The rapid movement of the clouds and rain creates a dynamic scene, with shifting light and shadow over the immense landscape. In the foreground, a portion of a rocky, arid cliff edge is visible.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
