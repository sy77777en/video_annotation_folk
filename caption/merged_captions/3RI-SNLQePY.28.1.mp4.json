  "merged_caption": "A stylized character with a detached head, wearing a brown, bird-like mask with antlers and a teal collared shirt, is positioned on the right side, partially behind a reddish-brown counter, holding a white mug. A thought bubble appears next to the character's head, containing geometric shapes. Above the character is a long, light-colored rectangular machine that dispenses objects selected by a white arrow cursor. This machine displays five symbols: a tooth, a crescent moon, a spider, two biscuits, and an acorn, each with a brown nozzle beneath. The video begins with the cursor at the bottom left of the frame, hovering over an eyeball icon on the user interface bar located at the very bottom of the screen. The cursor then moves upwards towards the machine at the top of the frame, selecting the spider icon and tapping the outlet below it, causing a question mark to drop from the nozzle. This process is repeated for the crescent moon and tooth symbols, with the cursor clicking the nozzles multiple times, causing several question marks to fall out. The video concludes as the cursor moves to the right, about to click the nozzle under the biscuits symbol. The scene is a screen recording of a 2D, hand-drawn video game with a muted color palette of gray, brown, and off-white. The game's user interface is visible as an overlay, featuring a top bar with symbols and a bottom bar with various icons, including a cluster of buildings and a backpack. Small question marks fall out of the machine as the cursor moves across the display, hovering over the symbols. The camera remains static throughout the video.",

    "Subject": "A stylized, animated character with a detached head is depicted sitting behind a reddish-brown bar, which functions as a table. The character's head is a brown, bird-like mask resembling that of a plague doctor, complete with two small antlers, and it floats just above the neck of a body wearing a teal collared shirt. The character's visible arm is dark and segmented, holding a white mug. A thought bubble appears next to the character's head, containing geometric shapes, including two triangles, a quarter-circle, and a rod. Above the character is a long, light-colored rectangular machine that dispenses objects selected by the cursor. This machine displays a row of five simple drawings: a tooth, a crescent moon, a spider, two biscuits, and an acorn. A white arrow cursor moves across the screen, interacting with the symbols on the machine. More icons sit on top of the reddish-brown bar at the bottom; these include a cluster of buildings, a backpack, and an eyeball.",

    "Scene": "A screen recording of a software or system interface shows a 2D, hand-drawn video game with a muted color palette of gray, brown, and off-white. A character with a long-beaked mask and antlers sits at a brown counter near the bottom of the frame, holding a white cup. Above the character's detached head, a thought bubble containing a symbol appears. Behind the character, a long, light-colored shelf displays five simple drawings: a tooth, a crescent moon, a crab, two biscuits, and an acorn. The game's user interface is visible as an overlay, featuring a top bar with symbols and a bottom bar with various icons. A white arrow cursor moves across the top bar, and small question marks fall out of the machine as it hovers over the different symbols.",
    "Spatial": "A stylized character is positioned on the right side, partially behind a brown counter. A thought bubble appears next to the character's head. A long display with five symbols spans the top of the frame. A user interface bar is located at the very bottom of the screen. A white arrow cursor moves across the display, hovering over the symbols. Small question marks fall out of a machine on the top as the cursor moves."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
