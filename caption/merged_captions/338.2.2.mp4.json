  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a woman in a maroon vest over a white shirt, positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, with the camera at her eye level. She is sitting at a table with a plate of food and a glass of lemonade in front of her. The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, focusing on the midground with a shallow depth of field. It smoothly pans right at a quick pace, transitioning focus from the woman with tied-up hair to a woman in a yellow garment sitting next to her, also with a plate of food and a glass of lemonade. As the camera continues to move, it reveals an older man in a maroon shirt, holding chopsticks and looking at his plate. The camera maintains its eye-level position throughout. Finally, the camera stops on a woman in a maroon burgundy vest with golden-yellow trim over a black long-sleeve shirt, centered in the frame and in the middle ground. She holds chopsticks over a plate, remaining stationary while speaking, indicating an interaction with the meal and the people around her. Throughout the sequence, the background consistently features the restaurant's interior, including framed paintings on the decorated walls, tables with white tablecloths, and a refined, opulent ceiling featuring a delicate chandelier, which remain static in the upper part of the frame. The camera's movement is smooth, transitioning from one subject to the next without altering its height or angle.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
