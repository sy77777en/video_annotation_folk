  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a close-up shot of tall, dry grass filling the frame, obscuring any initial view of the subject. The camera is positioned at ground level and angled high, looking down, using a shallow depth of field to focus on the midground. As the scene progresses, the camera slowly moves forward with noticeable shaking, transitioning into a medium shot that reveals a person from the waist down. The subject, wearing a brown jacket, beige pants, and dark green rubber boots, is positioned in the center of the frame, with their legs and lower torso visible. The person is actively walking through a dense, dry field of tall, golden-brown reeds, suggesting a sense of exploration. The sunlight casts a warm glow over the scene, enhancing the earthy tones of the reeds that dominate the visual palette. The subject is in the middle ground, surrounded by dense, tall reeds that dominate the foreground and background. The reeds are primarily located in the top and sides of the frame, while the person's legs and boots occupy the central area. The camera remains at the subject's level, capturing the movement of the person walking forward through the reeds. The subject's feet and boots are consistently in the bottom center of the frame, emphasizing their interaction with the ground covered in dry stalks. The video concludes with the person still walking through the grass, with the camera maintaining a close-up view of their lower body and the surrounding vegetation. The overall atmosphere is calm and natural, with the earthy tones of the reeds dominating the visual palette. There are no significant changes in the camera's height or angle, maintaining a consistent perspective focused on the subject's lower body and the surrounding reeds.",

    "Camera": "The video is in slow motion, with the camera positioned at ground level and angled high, looking down. It uses a shallow depth of field, focusing on the midground, specifically on the legs of a person walking through tall grass. The camera moves slowly forward with noticeable shaking, indicating unsteady motion.",
    "Subject": "The video reveals a person standing in a field of tall, dry grass. The individual is wearing a brown jacket and beige pants, complemented by dark green rubber boots. The person is facing away, with their lower body visible among the dense grass, which is a prominent feature throughout the scene. The video begins with the view initially obscured by the tall grass, gradually revealing the subject as the camera or subject moves, focusing on the interaction between the person and the natural environment.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a close-up of tall, dry grass, with the camera slowly moving forward, gradually revealing more of the scene. As the camera progresses, the legs and feet of a person wearing a brown jacket, beige pants, and dark green rubber boots become visible, walking through the grass. The person continues to walk forward, with the camera following their movement, capturing the dense grass and the person's steady pace. The video concludes with the person still walking through the grass, with the camera maintaining a close-up view of their lower body and the surrounding vegetation.",
    "Scene": "The video depicts an outdoor setting in a dense, dry field of tall, golden-brown reeds. The time of day appears to be during daylight, with sunlight casting a warm glow over the scene. The ground is covered with dry, broken stalks, adding a textured layer to the earth. The reeds are slender and vertical, creating a natural barrier that fills the environment. A person is present, wearing green boots and beige clothing, actively walking through the reeds, suggesting a sense of exploration and movement through the field. The overall atmosphere is calm and natural, with the earthy tones of the reeds dominating the visual palette.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
