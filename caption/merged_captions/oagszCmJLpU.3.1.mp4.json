  "merged_caption": "This video presents a static extreme wide shot of a dramatic landscape, focusing on a weather event rather than a specific subject. A massive, dark storm cloud occupies most of the frame, creating a striking visual impact. A rain shaft extends from the cloud to the ground, covering both the background and middle ground on the right side of the frame. In contrast, a break in the clouds revealing blue sky is located in the top left of the frame. A flat, dark plain stretches across the bottom of the frame, extending from the foreground to the background. On the horizon, a small tree is silhouetted in the bottom center-left, with a slender tower to its right in the bottom center, both located in the background. The camera is positioned at a low angle, looking up at the sky. This is a greatly accelerated time-lapse video of a storm. The shot is captured from a static but slightly unsteady camera, positioned at a low angle somewhere between overhead and eye level. The use of deep focus ensures that the entire landscape and the dramatic cloud formations are kept sharp. The video captures the dynamic movements of the massive cloud as it churns and shifts across the sky. A colossal, dark grey supercell storm cloud dominates the sky, its turbulent, rotating base lowering towards a flat, dark plain. To the right, a heavy rain shaft visibly connects the cloud to the ground, while a stark contrast is created on the left by a break in the clouds, revealing a patch of bright blue sky and brilliantly lit white cloud formations. The overwhelming size of the storm is further emphasized by the tiny silhouettes of a lone tree and a distant, slender tower on the horizon, which serve to highlight the sheer power of the natural spectacle.",

    "Subject": "This video captures a dramatic landscape scenery shot, focusing on the immense scale and atmosphere of a powerful weather event rather than a specific main subject. A colossal, dark grey supercell storm cloud dominates the sky, its turbulent, rotating base lowering towards a flat, dark plain. To the right, a heavy rain shaft visibly connects the cloud to the ground, while a stark contrast is created on the left by a break in the clouds, revealing a patch of bright blue sky and brilliantly lit white cloud formations.

    "Motion": "A dramatic shot of a massive supercell storm cloud looms over a flat, rural landscape. A lone tree and a tall, thin structure stand on the horizon under the immense, dark cloud formation. The video captures the dynamic movements of the massive cloud as it churns and shifts across the sky.",
    "Scene": "An outdoor scene captures a vast, flat landscape beneath a dramatic and turbulent sky. A massive, dark gray storm cloud dominates the view, featuring a low-hanging, well-defined base from which curtains of rain fall in the distance. To the left, a break in the storm reveals a patch of blue sky and bright white clouds. The horizon is a dark, straight line, punctuated by the silhouettes of a single tree and a tall, thin tower against the pale light at the edge of the plain.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
