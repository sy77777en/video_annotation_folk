  "merged_caption": "In a close-up shot, a hand holding a black smartphone occupies the center of the frame in the middle ground. A small part of a person's shoulder is visible in the bottom right foreground, establishing an over-the-shoulder point of view. The phone's screen is illuminated, displaying a security alert on a red and black interface with the word \"ALARM\" in large white text and \"perimeter breached\" in smaller text below it. The display also features a dark, map-like graphic with a single green dot. The camera, positioned above the subject, looks down at the hand and phone, using a shallow depth of field to focus on the phone in the midground. The camera moves smoothly, initially tilting up before slowly tilting down in small, intermittent movements. The hand holding the smartphone makes slight movements to maintain a firm grip while keeping the device's screen in focus. The scene remains mostly static with minimal movement from the hand, the phone, or the background elements. In the out-of-focus background, several green bonsai trees are positioned on the left side of the frame, sitting on a light-colored surface. The scene takes place during the day on a balcony, where the bonsai trees with green foliage are visible in pots.",

    "Scene": "From an over-the-shoulder POV, the camera captures part of the shoulder and the scene ahead, with a hand holding a black smartphone. The phone's screen is illuminated with a red alert, displaying the words \"Alarm\" and \"perimeter breached\" over a dark, map-like graphic. The scene takes place during the day on a balcony, where several potted bonsai trees with green foliage sit on a light-colored surface in the out-of-focus background.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
