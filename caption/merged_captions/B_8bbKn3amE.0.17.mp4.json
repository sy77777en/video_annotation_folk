  "merged_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot focused on a large, snow-covered mountain. Initially, the mountain's peak is positioned in the center-right of the frame, rising from the middle ground into the background. A snowy ridge occupies the bottom-left foreground. In the top of the frame, white clouds partially obscure the upper mountain, with a patch of blue sky visible in the top-left. The camera, positioned at a high angle level with the mountain's mid-section, moves forward and alongside the peak. As it advances, the foreground ridge recedes to the left, and the main mountain face becomes more central and dominant, revealing more of its vast, textured slopes. This smooth aerial drone shot flies forward toward the snow-covered mountain. The camera simultaneously pans to the right and rolls clockwise, creating a dynamic, varying Dutch angle. The footage exhibits mild barrel distortion and uses a deep focus to keep the entire majestic landscape sharp. The camera glides smoothly alongside the rugged, icy peak, offering a wide view of the mountain's dramatic rock faces and glaciers against a backdrop of blue sky and swirling clouds. Sunlight breaks through the cloud cover to illuminate the upper reaches of the mountain, creating a brilliant glow on the vast fields of snow and ice that contrast sharply with the dark, exposed rock faces below. The peak is sharp and jagged, with dark, rocky faces exposed beneath a thick layer of white snow and ice. Vast snowfields and glaciers cover the surrounding slopes. Above, a patch of deep blue sky is visible through breaks in the white, drifting clouds that partially obscure the upper reaches of the mountain range. There is no main subject, as the focus is entirely on the overwhelming grandeur and raw, natural beauty of the alpine environment.",

    "Subject": "This is a majestic mountain scenery shot, capturing the immense scale of a jagged, snow-covered peak rising into a sky of deep blue and white clouds. Sunlight breaks through the cloud cover to illuminate the upper reaches of the mountain, creating a brilliant glow on the vast fields of snow and ice that contrast sharply with the dark, exposed rock faces below.

    "Motion": "This video presents a breathtaking aerial scenery shot of a massive, snow-covered mountain. The camera glides smoothly alongside the rugged, icy peak, offering a wide view of the mountain's dramatic rock faces and glaciers against a backdrop of blue sky and swirling clouds.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone moves alongside a towering, snow-covered mountain. The peak is sharp and jagged, with dark, rocky faces exposed beneath a thick layer of white snow and ice. Vast snowfields and glaciers cover the surrounding slopes. Above, a patch of deep blue sky is visible through breaks in the white, drifting clouds that partially obscure the upper reaches of the mountain range.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
