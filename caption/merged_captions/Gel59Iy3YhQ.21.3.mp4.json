  "merged_caption": "The scene is captured from a top-down perspective, showing a pixel-art golf course. Initially, a small golfer character in a green shirt and brown pants is positioned in the center-left of the frame, standing on a sand trap. A heads-up display is overlaid with game information in the top left, including the 2nd hole, a 650-yard Par 5, the player's score of \"E,\" and rank of \"2ND.\" The club selection menu in the bottom left shows \"DRIVER\" and \"PRO WOODS,\" while a long power meter at the bottom center fills with a red and purple bar. Environmental indicators, including wind speed and slope, are in the top right. The course features a striped green fairway, light tan sand traps, dark blue water hazards, and clusters of green trees and bushes. As the player aims, the camera remains steady, following the aiming line across the course, with the distance to a red flag marker changing. After the shot, the golf ball is struck, launching into the air and traveling to the upper right, leaving a long gray trail behind. The camera smoothly tracks the ball as it crosses a body of water and a rectangular landmass, with the ball changing in size to indicate distance. It flies from the center-left toward the upper right of the frame, keeping it centered until it lands on another fairway in a blue area. A large, white golf ball sits on a tee in the bottom right corner, and the interface includes a small avatar of a man with brown hair and a green shirt in the top left corner.",

    "Subject": "This video showcases the gameplay of a pixel-art golf video game from a top-down perspective. The user interface displays information for the 2nd hole, a 650-yard Par 5. In the top left corner, a small avatar of a man with brown hair and a green shirt is shown next to his score of \"E\" and rank of \"2ND.\" The course itself is rendered with green trees, blue water, light brown sand traps, a striped green fairway, and a large area of blue land. A small, pixelated golfer character in a green shirt and brown pants is shown aiming a shot. As the aim is adjusted, the distance to a red flag marker changes. The interface also includes a wind indicator, a slope indicator, a club selection menu showing \"DRIVER\" and \"PRO WOODS,\" and a long power meter at the bottom. In the bottom right corner, a large, white golf ball sits on a tee. The sequence shows the player aiming and then hitting the ball, which travels across the course.",
    "Motion": "From a top-down perspective, a power meter at the bottom of the screen fills with a red and purple bar. The golf ball is then struck, launching into the air and traveling to the upper right, leaving a long gray trail behind. It crosses a body of water and a rectangular landmass before landing on another fairway.",
    "Scene": "A gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view, where the camera is placed directly above the character and looks down on them, shows a pixel-art golf course. The course is composed of a striped green fairway, light tan sand traps, and dark blue water hazards, all surrounded by clusters of green trees and bushes. The camera shifts upwards and to the right to follow the flight of a white golf ball across the landscape, with the ball changing in size to indicate distance. A heads-up display with multiple overlay elements is visible. In the top left corner, text indicates the hole number, par, and total yardage, along with the player's score. The bottom of the screen features the selected club, \"DRIVER,\" and a long power meter. In the top right, indicators show the wind speed and slope. A red flag icon on the course displays the changing distance to the hole.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
