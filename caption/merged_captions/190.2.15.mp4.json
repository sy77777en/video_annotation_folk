  "merged_caption": "In this video, the car, with its dark, glossy finish and chrome details, stands out in the foreground, its emblem adding to the classic vibe. The urban backdrop, with buildings, trees, and other vehicles, suggests a city setting. The bare trees hint at late autumn or winter, while the partly cloudy sky casts a neutral light over the scene. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, focusing on the man in the car's midground using a shallow depth of field. The camera pans slightly to the right and tilts down slightly, moving smoothly with minimal shaking. A man with a medium to dark skin tone, wearing glasses, a dark hat, a dark jacket, and a white shirt, is seated in the driver's seat of a vintage Oldsmobile, viewed through the car's windshield. His head and part of his shoulder are visible, with the rest obscured by the car. The man remains mostly still, with slight movements of his head and shoulders. The vintage Oldsmobile comes to a stop as another car passes by on the right in the background, adding a dynamic element to the typical city environment. The text \"Malcolm X (1992)\" is displayed at the bottom right, indicating the video's title and year.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
