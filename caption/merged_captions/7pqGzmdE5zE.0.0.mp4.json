  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a pair of light-skinned hands, one positioned in the left-center and the other at the bottom of the frame, opening a brown cardboard shipping box on a light-colored, textured comforter. One hand is wearing a black ribbed sweater sleeve and both are adorned with rings. The hands are in the foreground, while the box is in the middle ground and the comforter forms the background. As the hands open the box, clear plastic air-filled packaging is visible inside. The camera maintains a static, high-angle shot filmed from eye level, using a shallow depth of field that initially focuses on the midground as the box is opened. The hands reach into the cardboard shipping box and lift out a smaller, light-brown product box labeled \"EVISTR Digital Voice Recorder\" in black text, which also features a graphic of a microphone beside the word \"REC.\" The focus then tracks the product box as it is lifted from the center of the shipping box into the foreground, keeping it sharp. The hands hold the product box steady, displaying its front, while the camera maintains a top-down perspective throughout, with the hands consistently in the foreground and the comforter in the background.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
