  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot, tracking a male character from behind, centered in the frame as he ascends a rocky path from the foreground toward the middle ground. He has long, white hair tied back in a braid with a black and white wrap at the top of his head and is wearing a black long-sleeved top, dark pants, and a red sash around his waist. The camera starts from a smooth, hip-level position and moves forward and upward, tail-tracking the character as he walks up the path. The scene is set on a flat, stone-paved clifftop in a mountainous region, bathed in the warm, golden light of a large sun positioned low on the horizon, suggesting either sunrise or sunset. The ground is composed of geometric, light-colored stone slabs, with a prominent circular pattern etched into the surface, and small green bushes dot the rocky terrain. As the character reaches a circular stone platform on the summit in the middle ground, the camera rises to eye level. He steps onto the platform, comes to a stop in the center, and stands still, facing away from the camera towards a mountainous landscape. The shot then zooms out, transitioning to a wide shot. In this final composition, the character remains in the center of the frame but is now smaller within the middle ground. The wide shot reveals an expansive landscape with a large sun in the upper-center background and distant, stylized mountain peaks rising from a layer of low-lying mist, set against a hazy, pale sky. The camera's final position is slightly above the subject, looking down at him and across the vista, with a deep focus keeping both the character and the background scenery clear throughout the shot.",

    "Camera": "In this animated scene, the camera starts from a smooth, hip-level position and moves forward and upward, tail-tracking a man in a black outfit as he walks up a rocky path. The camera rises to eye level as he reaches a mountaintop clearing. Once he stops, the camera zooms out to reveal the vast, mountainous landscape behind him. A deep focus keeps both the character and the background scenery clear throughout the shot.",
    "Subject": "The video follows a male character, seen from behind, as he walks up a rocky path. He has long, white hair tied back in a braid with a black and white wrap at the top of his head. He is wearing a black long-sleeved top, dark pants, and a red sash around his waist. After ascending the path, he comes to a stop on a circular stone platform, standing still and continuing to face away from the camera.",
    "Motion": "A character walks up a rocky path and steps onto a circular stone platform. He then comes to a stop in the center and stands still, facing away from the camera towards a mountainous landscape.",
    "Scene": "In a third-person 3D game video where the entire character is visible on screen, the scene is set on a flat, stone-paved clifftop in a mountainous region. The environment is bathed in the warm, golden light of a large sun positioned low on the horizon, suggesting either sunrise or sunset. The ground is composed of geometric, light-colored stone slabs, with a prominent circular pattern etched into the surface. Small green bushes dot the rocky terrain. In the distance, stylized mountain peaks rise from a layer of low-lying mist, set against a hazy, pale sky. The video shows a character running across the clifftop before coming to a stop to overlook the expansive vista.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium shot, tracking a game character from behind, centered in the frame as they ascend a rocky path from the foreground toward the middle ground. The camera keeps the character centered, following their upward movement from a position at the subject's level. Upon reaching a circular stone platform on the summit in the middle ground, the character stops, and the shot zooms out, transitioning to a wide shot. In this final composition, the character remains in the center of the frame but is now smaller within the middle ground. The wide shot reveals an expansive landscape with a large sun in the upper-center background, and distant mountains rising from mist in the background. The camera's final position is slightly above the subject, looking down at them and across the vista."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
