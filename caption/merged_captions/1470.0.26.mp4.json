  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot, a person with light skin is lying back in a white, claw-foot bathtub filled with white bubbles, located in the middle ground of a small, dimly lit bathroom with a slanted ceiling. The person is wearing a purple shower cap with cucumber slices over her eyes and orange headphones, appearing to enjoy herself. Only her head and the top of her shoulders are visible above the bubbles. The bathtub occupies the center of the frame, also in the middle ground. To the left, a toilet is positioned in the middle ground. To the right, a radiator stands in the background, next to a green wicker bench further right, also in the middle ground. A blue towel hangs on the right wall in the middle ground, above the bench which holds a folded pink towel. A window is visible in the center background, partially covered by a patterned shower curtain hanging to its left in the middle ground/background. Bright sunlight streams through the large window fitted with horizontal blinds, creating areas of brightness and shadow within the room. A small yellow rubber duck sits on the windowsill to the right of center in the background. Slippers are visible in the bottom center foreground. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, maintaining a deep focus with a large depth of field. It executes a very smooth, minor zoom-in movement, gradually zooming in at the subject's level throughout. The strong light from the window highlights the scene, with the camera capturing the serene atmosphere as the person relaxes in the bathtub.",

    "Subject": "In the video, a person with light skin is wearing a purple shower cap with cucumber slices over her eyes, relaxing in a white, claw-foot bathtub filled with white bubbles. Only her head and the top of her shoulders are visible above the bubbles. She is wearing a pair of orange headphones, appearing to enjoy herself. A small yellow rubber duck is placed on the windowsill near the person's head.",
    "Motion": "The scene is set in a small, dimly lit bathroom with a slanted ceiling, featuring a white claw-foot bathtub filled with bubbles. The person is lying back in the bathtub, with their head resting against the edge and their eyes covered by cucumber slices. The bathroom has a window with blinds partially open, allowing some light to filter in. There is a radiator to the right of the bathtub, at the lower right corner of the window, a towel hanging on the wall, and a small bench with a blue towel and a pink item on it. A pair of blue slippers is placed on the floor near the bathtub.",
    "Scene": "The video presents an indoor scene of a bathroom during the day. Bright sunlight streams through a large window fitted with horizontal blinds and partially covered by a patterned shower curtain. Central to the room is a white, clawfoot bathtub filled with soapy bubbles, where a person is bathing. To the left of the tub, a toilet is visible, along with a towel hanging on the wall. To the right, an upright metal radiator stands beside the tub, and further along the wall, a blue towel hangs above a green wicker bench holding a folded pink towel. The room features slanted walls, indicative of an attic or upper-level space, and has wooden flooring partly covered by a small grey bathmat. A pair of blue flip-flops lies on the floor near the tub. The strong light from the window creates areas of brightness and shadow within the room.",
    "Spatial": "In a wide shot, a person lies back in a bathtub located in the middle ground of the bathroom. The bathtub itself occupies the center of the frame, also in the middle ground. To the left, a toilet is positioned in the middle ground. To the right, a radiator stands in the background, next to a wicker bench further right, also in the middle ground. A blue towel hangs on the right wall in the middle ground, above the bench which holds a pink towel. A window is visible in the center background, partially covered by a shower curtain hanging to its left in the middle ground/background.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
