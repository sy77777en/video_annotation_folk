  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot, featuring a red, square, insulated delivery bag with black straps and a red top flap placed on the floor in the bottom-left foreground, topped with three light brown cardboard boxes. A dark gray apartment door, marked with the number \"186\" on a plaque above, is positioned in the center middle ground. The camera remains mostly stationary and at the subjects' height throughout the video, with some slight unsteady movements present. The door opens, and a light-skinned man with short blond hair, wearing a pink face mask, a light gray button-up shirt over a blue t-shirt, and black pants, emerges from the center of the frame. He steps forward toward the bottom-left foreground, bends down to pick up the stack of cardboard boxes, and then moves back into the apartment, closing the door. The apartment's interior, briefly visible, contains a plant and a wooden stool. Shortly after, a second light-skinned man with curly dark brown hair, wearing a white hoodie, blue jeans, and a pink face mask, walks into the frame from the right. He walks towards the bottom-left foreground and is positioned in the center foreground of the frame to bend over and pick up the red delivery bag. The scene takes place in an indoor hallway of an apartment building with white walls, a light-colored tiled floor, and dark brown baseboards. A second dark door is visible further down the corridor. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire hallway scene, from the delivery bag in the foreground to the apartment interior, in sharp focus.",

    "Camera": "This is an eye-level shot with a level angle. The camera remains mostly still, with minor, uncertain movements. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire hallway scene, from the delivery bag in the foreground to the apartment interior, in sharp focus.",
    "Subject": "The video shows a red, square, insulated delivery bag with black straps and a red top flap placed on the floor in front of a dark gray apartment door. Three light brown cardboard boxes are stacked on top of the bag. A light-skinned man with short blond hair, wearing a pink face mask, a light gray button-up shirt over a blue t-shirt, and black pants, opens the door from the inside. He steps out, picks up the cardboard boxes, and goes back into the apartment, closing the door. A moment later, a second light-skinned man with curly dark brown hair, wearing a white hoodie, blue jeans, and a pink face mask, walks into view from the right and picks up the red delivery bag.",
    "Motion": "A man opens an apartment door, steps out into the hallway, bends down to pick up a stack of cardboard boxes, and carries them back inside before closing the door.

    "Scene": "The scene takes place in an indoor hallway of an apartment building with white walls, a light-colored tiled floor, and dark brown baseboards. A dark gray metal door, marked with the number \"186\" on a plaque above, is centrally located. In front of the door sits a red insulated delivery bag with black straps, topped with three stacked cardboard pizza boxes. The door opens, and a person wearing a mask emerges to pick up the pizza boxes before going back inside and closing the door. The apartment's interior, briefly visible, contains a plant and a wooden stool. Later, another person in a mask enters the hallway and picks up the red delivery bag. A second dark door is visible further down the corridor.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a wide shot, featuring a red delivery bag with cardboard boxes stacked on it in the bottom-left foreground. A dark gray apartment door is positioned in the center middle ground, with the number \"186\" plaque located top-center above it. The door opens, and a man, captured in a full shot, emerges from the center of the frame. He steps forward toward the bottom-left foreground, picks up the cardboard boxes, and then moves back into the apartment, closing the door. Shortly after, a second man, also in a full shot, walks into the frame from the right, walks towards the bottom-left foreground, and is positioned in the center foreground of the frame to pick up the red bag. The camera remains mostly stationary and at the subjects' height throughout the video, with some slight unsteady movements present."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
