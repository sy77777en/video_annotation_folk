  "merged_caption": "The video opens from a high-angle perspective, looking down at a circular glass lampshade on the cross-section of a wooden stump, with a lit bulb inside in the foreground, and a white heater positioned on the right. The camera, initially at eye level with a high angle, slightly moves forward, pedestals up, and pans right, revealing the wooden lattice ceiling and grid-like wooden walls of a yurt. This movement transitions to an eye-level view, sweeping across the interior, which features a distinctive wooden lattice wall and a conical roof with radiating wooden poles covered by a white fabric liner. The space is furnished with a small kitchenette area featuring a wooden countertop, a white mini-fridge, and a black electric kettle. A blue armchair holding a brown furry pillow, a blue chest of drawers, and a light-wood chest of drawers decorated with small Christmas-themed figures are also visible. As the camera continues to pan right while moving forward, the kitchenette shifts from the right to the left of the frame and eventually goes out of frame on the left, followed by the blue armchair and a wooden door. A black and orange backpack rests on the dark floor near the door. The camera then pans left to center a key hanging on the lattice wall, moving closer to a wooden key holder. A light-skinned hand enters from the bottom left foreground, reaching toward the center to touch a padlock beside a light blue tag on the holder, which becomes the central focus as the camera pushes in slightly, maintaining deep focus throughout and finishing with a forward movement.",

    "Camera": "The camera is initially positioned at eye level with a high angle, looking down from above. Deep focus is maintained throughout, keeping all elements in the frame sharp. Camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking: it slightly moves forward, then pedestals up and pans right, following the person toward the house. The camera angle transitions to a level angle as it pedestals up and pans right, before returning to a slightly high angle at the end. As the person approaches the key hanging on the wall, the camera continues to pan right while moving forward, then pans left to center the key in the frame, finishing with a forward movement.",
    "Subject": "The video reveals the interior of a yurt through a series of camera movements, including moving forward, pedestaling up, and panning right, as it follows a person toward the house. The structure has a distinctive wooden lattice wall and a conical roof with radiating wooden poles, covered by a white fabric liner. The space is furnished with a small kitchenette area featuring a wooden countertop, a white mini-fridge, and a black electric kettle. Other furniture includes a blue armchair holding a brown furry pillow, a blue chest of drawers, and a light-wood chest of drawers decorated with small Christmas-themed figures. A white electric heater is mounted on the wall, and a black and orange backpack rests on the dark floor near a wooden door. As the person approaches the key hanging on the wall, the camera continues to pan right while moving forward, then pans left to center the key in the frame, finishing with a forward movement. A person's light-skinned hand appears, approaching a padlock beside a light blue tag, attempting to remove it from a wooden hook on the wall.",
    "Motion": "The camera starts at eye level with a high angle, looking down at a round glass cover with a light bulb inside. It then slightly moves forward, pedestals up, and pans right, following a person toward the house. This reveals the interior of a yurt, passing various pieces of furniture and a wooden door. As the person approaches the key hanging on the wall, the camera continues to pan right while moving forward, then pans left to center the key in the frame. A hand enters the frame from the bottom left, takes hold of a padlock, and seems to attempt to lift it off its hook.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves around the interior of a cozy, furnished yurt. The structure features distinctive wooden lattice walls and radiating roof rafters, with a white fabric liner visible behind the woodwork. The space is decorated with modern furniture, including a blue armchair, a blue chest of drawers, and natural wood drawers. A small kitchenette area contains a mini-fridge under a wooden countertop, along with a black electric kettle. A white electric heater is mounted on the wall, and festive decorations, including small gnomes and a decorative tree, are placed on the furniture. The camera movement concludes near a wooden door, where a hand reaches out to touch a padlock hanging from a rustic holder on the wall.",
    "Spatial": "The video opens from a high-angle perspective, looking down at a circular glass lampshade on the cross-section of a wooden stump, with a lit bulb inside in the foreground, and a white heater positioned on the right. After the camera pedestals up and pans right, it reveals the wooden lattice ceiling and the grid-like wooden walls. The camera then continues to pan right while moving forward, transitioning to an eye-level view that sweeps across the interior. This movement reveals a kitchenette, which shifts from the right to the left of the frame and eventually goes out of frame on the left, followed by a blue armchair and a wooden door that also appear from the right side and disappear from the left side. As the camera continues moving forward and panning right and then left, a light-wood chest of drawers appears from the right, moves to the center, then disappears to the right. The camera's movement then focuses on the lattice wall, moving closer to a wooden key holder. A hand enters from the bottom left foreground, reaching toward the center to touch a padlock on the holder, which becomes the central focus as the camera pushes in slightly."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
