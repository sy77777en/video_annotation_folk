  "merged_caption": "In a dynamic, wide, side-view shot set in a lush, sun-dappled forest during the day, a large, rotund, dark purple creature with a bear-like form and small, dark eyes carries a small, white, spirit-like creature on its back. The smaller creature is luminous, with a slender body, long, pointed ears, and thin limbs, giving it a delicate, ethereal appearance. Positioned in the center-right of the frame, the creatures are situated in the middle ground, moving forward on a wooden fence. The large creature sways from side to side as it takes slow, deliberate steps, while the small creature on its back remains seated, bobbing gently in sync with the larger creature's gait. The camera smoothly trucks right, tracking their movement to the right and upward as they progress through the forest. The scene is framed by large, thick-trunked trees with dense green foliage in the middle ground and background, with hazy golden light filtering through the canopy. The foreground and middle ground are covered in vibrant green grass, moss, and small purple flowers, with a nest-like structure made of woven twigs visible in the bottom-left. Particles of light drift through the air, enhancing the ethereal atmosphere. As the creatures continue, the camera rises slightly as they jump onto a rickety wooden swing, capturing the scene's dynamic motion.",

    "Camera": "This is a level-angle shot where the camera smoothly trucks right, tracking a small, glowing white creature and a larger, dark creature. The camera rises slightly as the characters jump onto a wooden platform.",
    "Subject": "A large, rotund, dark purple creature with a bear-like form carries a small, white, spirit-like creature on its back. The smaller creature is luminous, with a slender body, long, pointed ears, and thin limbs, giving it a delicate, ethereal appearance. The larger creature has a bulky, rounded physique and small, dark eyes, contrasting with the bright, glowing form of its passenger.",
    "Motion": "A large, dark purple creature walks from left to right across a wooden structure, carrying a small, white, glowing creature on its back. The large creature sways from side to side as it takes slow, deliberate steps. The small creature on its back remains seated, bobbing gently in sync with the larger creature's gait.",
    "Scene": "In a side-view gaming video set in a lush, sun-dappled forest during the day, large, thick-trunked trees with dense green foliage populate the environment, with hazy golden light filtering through the canopy. The ground is a vibrant green, covered in grass, moss, and small purple flowers. On the left, a small nest-like structure made of woven twigs rests on the ground. To the right, a large, dark purple creature navigates through the forest and leaps onto a rickety wooden swing. A small, white, glowing creature is perched on its neck, with particles of light drifting through the air.",
    "Spatial": "In a dynamic, wide, side-view shot, a large, dark purple creature and a small, white creature are positioned in the center-right of the frame, situated in the middle ground. The small, luminous creature rides on the neck of the larger one, which moves forward on a wooden fence. The camera tracks their movement to the right and upward as they progress through the forest. The scene is framed by large trees in the middle ground and background. The foreground and middle ground are covered in green grass and foliage, with a nest-like structure visible in the bottom-left. The creatures eventually jump onto a wooden swing, with the camera capturing the scene."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
