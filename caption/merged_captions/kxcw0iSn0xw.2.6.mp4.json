  "merged_caption": "In a close-up, high-angle shot, a person's light-skinned right hand, splattered with pink and blue paint, is initially positioned in the top-center of the frame, holding two spinning tops in the center of the foreground on a light brown wooden surface with visible grain. The tops, one with a red and pink finned section filled with red and yellow paint and the other with a pink and blue finned section filled with pink and blue paint, are attached to blue and white launchers. As the right hand quickly moves out of the frame from the top-center and the left hand remains stationary in the center, the hands operate the launchers, causing the tops to spin rapidly. The camera captures this action from above with a deep focus, keeping the spinning tops and resulting paint splatters sharp. The rapid spinning flings the vibrant paint outwards in thin, arcing streams, creating a chaotic, web-like pattern of red, pink, yellow, and blue splatters across the wooden surface that serves as the background. The video skillfully transitions between slow motion and regular speed, enhancing the viewer's ability to appreciate the intricate details of the paint being flung outward. The tops eventually slow to a stop in the left-top of the frame, with the launchers they were attached to now visible in the bottom-center, leaving pools of mixed paint on the surface.",

    "Camera": "This high-angle shot captures the action from above with a deep focus, keeping the spinning tops and resulting paint splatters sharp. The video skillfully transitions between slow motion and regular speed, enhancing the viewer's ability to appreciate the intricate details of the paint being flung outward.",
    "Subject": "A person's light-skinned hands and arm, splattered with pink and blue paint, operate two spinning tops on a wooden surface. The top on the left has a red and pink finned section and is filled with red and yellow paint. The top on the right has a pink and blue finned section and is filled with pink and blue paint. Both tops are attached to blue and white launchers. As the tops spin, they fling the brightly colored paint outwards in thin, arcing lines and splatters.",
    "Motion": "A person's hands operate two launchers, causing two tops to spin rapidly and fling colorful paint outwards in arcing lines across a wooden surface. The right hand quickly moves away, releasing the tops from the launchers, and the tops continue to spin on the surface before coming to a stop.",
    "Scene": "An overhead POV shot where the camera is positioned directly above the subject for a top-down perspective shows a light brown wooden surface with a visible grain. A pair of hands pulls ripcords on two spinning tops, one red and yellow and the other pink and blue, which are filled with paint. The rapid spinning flings the vibrant paint outwards in thin, arcing streams, creating a chaotic, web-like pattern of red, pink, yellow, and blue splatters across the wood. The tops eventually slow and stop, leaving the launchers and pools of mixed paint on the surface.",
    "Spatial": "In a close-up, high-angle shot, a person's right hand is initially positioned in the top-center of the frame, holding two spinning tops in the center of the foreground. As the right hand quickly moves out of the frame from the top-center and the left hand remains stationary in the center, the tops spin in place, flinging paint outwards across the wooden surface that serves as the background. The tops eventually slow to a stop in the left-top of the frame, with the launchers they were attached to now visible in the bottom-center."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
