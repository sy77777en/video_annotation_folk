  "merged_caption": "This wide shot, captured from a side-view perspective at the subject's height, initially frames a small, white, insect-like character with a horned, mask-like head and two large, black, empty eye sockets in the center-right of the scene, positioned in the middle ground on a raised platform next to a dark, ornate bench. The character, clad in a dark, tattered cloak, stands on a spiky, dark-colored ledge emitting a faint purple glow. In the foreground, large, sinuous black shapes occupy the left and top of the frame, with spiky ground along the bottom. The setting is a dark, monochromatic, cavernous environment, defined by sharp, spiky ground and long, dark tendrils hanging from above, with a blurry, indistinct background. A user interface is visible in the top-left corner, displaying a row of nine white, mask-like icons, a flower-shaped symbol, and the number 2722. The slightly unsteady camera, which exhibits some shaking, first moves down to center the character. The character then leaps from the platform towards the left, moving to the center of the frame. While airborne in the middle ground, it releases a large, teardrop-shaped flash of bright white light that radiates outward from its central position. The camera quickly trucks to the left to follow the character from the side. On the raised platform, glowing purple crystals are visible next to the bench.",

    "Camera": "This is a 2D side-scrolling video game. The slightly unsteady camera, which exhibits some shaking, first moves down to center the character. It then quickly trucks to the left to follow the character from the side.",
    "Subject": "A small, white, insect-like character with a horned, mask-like head and two large, black, empty eye sockets stands in a dark, monochromatic environment. The character, clad in a dark, tattered cloak, is positioned on a spiky, dark-colored ledge next to a simple bench. In the upper-left corner, a display shows a row of nine white, mask-like icons and the number 2722 next to a white, flower-shaped symbol. The character is also seen emitting a large, bright white flash of light that radiates outward.",
    "Motion": "The small, white character stands on a ledge, emitting a faint purple glow. It then leaps to the left, and while airborne, it releases a large, teardrop-shaped flash of white light that expands outward.",
    "Scene": "In a side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene in profile, the setting is a dark, monochromatic, cavernous environment. The landscape is defined by sharp, spiky ground and long, dark tendrils hanging from above, with large, sinuous, black shapes dominating the foreground and a blurry, indistinct background. On a raised platform, a dark, ornate bench sits next to glowing purple crystals. A small, white character is seen standing beside the bench before leaping into the air and executing an attack that produces a large, bright white flash of light. An overlay is present in the top-left corner, displaying a row of mask icons, a flower-shaped symbol, and the number 2722.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
