  "merged_caption": "This wide shot, filmed from a high angle above the scene, initially frames a cartoon character with a round, orange, pumpkin-like head and a simple smiling face in the center of the screen and the middle ground, standing beside a stone well with a wooden frame. The well is also in the center middle ground, while a small garden plot is visible in the top center, and white fences line the background. The character, clad in a long, hooded, purple-grey cloak with only thin, brown, stick-like legs visible, stands beside the well before running across the grass toward the small, fenced-in garden plot. Upon reaching the plot, the character stops at the upper left corner and harvests a single red, rose-like plant, causing pink particles to fly into the air due to the character's rapid movement. The character remains slightly above the center of the frame, maintaining a consistent relative position within the frame. The camera, from an overhead, high-angle perspective, maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp and smoothly tracks the avatar, moving upward and slightly to the left as the character walks forward. The scene is set in a cartoon-styled yard at dusk, illuminated by warm light from lanterns. The garden area is enclosed by white picket fences, and the rectangular garden plot is bordered by stones and fences. UI elements, including a coin count displaying \"135\" in the bottom left corner, an inventory bar with various icons and a \"HOLD [F]\" prompt at the bottom center, and two vertical meters, one blue and one yellow, at the bottom right, are positioned in the foreground. The camera and framing remain static throughout the shot.",

    "Subject": "A cartoon character with a round, orange, pumpkin-like head featuring a simple smiling face is shown in a grassy area. The character is clad in a long, hooded, purple-grey cloak that covers its entire body, with only its thin, brown, stick-like legs visible. In the center of the scene is a stone well with a wooden frame, surrounded by a circular, brown-tiled path. Nearby, a small garden plot, enclosed by a white picket fence and a stone border, contains a single red, rose-like plant.",

    "Scene": "A third-person 3D game video where the entire character is visible on screen is set in a cartoon-styled yard at dusk, illuminated by warm light from lanterns. The garden area is enclosed by white picket fences. In the center, a stone well with a wooden roof is surrounded by a circular, brown-tiled path. A small, cloaked character with a round, orange head walks from the well toward a rectangular garden plot bordered by stones and fences, which contains a single red plant. The video includes several overlay elements: in the bottom left corner, a gold coin icon displays the number \"135\"; at the bottom center is an inventory bar with various icons and a \"HOLD [F]\" prompt; and in the bottom right corner are two vertical meters, one blue and one yellow.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
