  "merged_caption": "The video features a close-up shot of a wooden cutting board, with the camera positioned above the subject at eye level with a high angle, looking down at the scene. The primary focus is on a person's hands slicing a cucumber into thin, half-moon pieces using a large knife. The video is in slow motion, capturing the slicing action as the right hand cuts while the left hand holds the cucumber steady. The hands and knife are positioned in the midground, emphasizing the cutting action. As the slicing progresses, cucumber slices accumulate in the center and left of the board, transitioning from the top right to the center and left, remaining in the midground. Fresh vegetables, including a red tomato, green lettuce, and a green onion, are arranged neatly in the bottom foreground, spanning from the bottom left to the bottom right. These elements remain static throughout the video, providing a colorful backdrop to the dynamic slicing action. The camera employs deep focus, ensuring all elements, including the cucumbers and surrounding vegetables, remain sharp. The overall composition highlights the preparation of fresh ingredients in a clean and organized kitchen setting, with the well-lit environment emphasizing the natural colors and textures of the vegetables. The scene emphasizes the preparation process, with the cucumber slices accumulating on the board as the cutting progresses.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
