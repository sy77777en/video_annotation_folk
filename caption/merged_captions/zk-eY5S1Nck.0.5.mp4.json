  "merged_caption": "In a full shot, a large blue balloon with a white string occupies the left foreground, while a young girl with light brown hair in two pigtails is positioned in the middle ground at the top of a dimly lit wooden staircase inside a home. She is wearing blue denim overalls over a pink t-shirt and pink shoes, holding a red balloon with a white string. The staircase extends from the bottom of the frame up towards the center, with a white railing running along the right side. The camera, positioned at the height of the balloon, initially looks up at the girl from an eye-level, low-angle perspective, using deep focus to keep both the girl and the large blue balloon sharp. As the girl begins to walk down the stairs toward the camera, the camera performs a very smooth, minor downward tilt, maintaining focus on her descent. The girl moves down to the camera's level, while the large blue balloon remains mostly stationary in the foreground. At the top of the stairs, a landing is visible, furnished with a white console table and several framed pictures mounted on the neutral-colored wall behind it.",

    "Camera": "From an eye-level, low-angle perspective, the camera looks up at a young girl standing at the top of a staircase. The shot uses deep focus, keeping both the girl and a large blue balloon in the foreground sharp. The camera performs a very smooth, minor downward tilt as she begins to walk down the stairs.",
    "Subject": "A young girl with light brown hair in two pigtails stands at the top of a staircase, looking forward. She is wearing blue denim overalls over a pink t-shirt and has pink shoes on her feet. In her hand, she holds a red balloon with a white string, while in the foreground to the left, a large, bright blue balloon floats.",
    "Motion": "A young girl walks down a wooden staircase toward the camera. A large blue balloon floats in the foreground, remaining mostly stationary as she descends.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set at the base of a dimly lit staircase inside a home. A large, blue balloon with a white string floats in the foreground, partially obscuring the view. The staircase features dark wooden steps and a white railing with vertical balusters. At the top of the stairs, a landing is visible, furnished with a white console table and several framed pictures mounted on the neutral-colored wall behind it. A young girl in denim overalls is descending the steps.",
    "Spatial": "In a full shot, a large blue balloon occupies the left foreground, while a young girl is positioned in the middle ground at the top of a staircase. The staircase extends from the bottom of the frame up towards the center, with a white railing running along the right side. The girl walks down the stairs. The camera is positioned at the height of the balloon; initially, the girl is higher than the camera, but as she descends the stairs, she moves down to the camera's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
