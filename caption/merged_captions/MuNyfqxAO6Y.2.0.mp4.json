  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot featuring a silver Nissan Skyline R34 GT-R in the center middle ground, its iconic round taillights glowing red. The ground is dark asphalt, with sections painted green and marked with a white directional arrow pointing toward the foreground. As the camera dollies forward slowly and smoothly, the white directional arrow shifts to the bottom center of the foreground. To the left, two people wearing dark clothing are crouched near a wall, illuminated by a bright blue light emitted from the headlights of the previous car. The rear of another dark grey, wide-body car is partially visible in the right middle ground, remaining stationary throughout the clip. Overhead lighting casts a greenish tint across the area, and a metal staircase ascends alongside a concrete wall. Orange and white traffic cones are placed around the scene. The silver car flashes its taillights before driving forward and turning right, moving away from the camera into the background. A dark grey Nissan Skyline R32 GT-R with white, multi-spoke wheels then enters from the right middle ground, drives forward, and follows the silver car's path, also turning right and moving into the background. In the center background, a green sign with Japanese characters is visible, and a green exit sign is present in the right middle ground. The camera continues to move forward, maintaining its position at the subjects' level throughout the clip, capturing the dynamic motion of the cars and the static elements of the scene with a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp.",

    "Camera": "This is a hip-level, level-angle shot with a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp. The camera dollies forward slowly and smoothly, moving towards the cars and the person positioned in the middle ground.",
    "Subject": "The video begins with a silver Nissan Skyline R34 GT-R driving out of a parking spot in the midground, its iconic round taillights glowing red. To the left, two people wearing dark clothing are crouched on the ground, illuminated by a bright blue light emitted from the headlights of the previous car. A dark grey Nissan Skyline R32 GT-R with white, multi-spoke wheels then enters the frame from the right, following the silver car. On the far right, the rear portion of another dark grey, wide-body car remains stationary throughout the clip.",
    "Motion": "A silver car, initially positioned in the midground, flashes its taillights before driving forward and turning right, moving away from the camera. A dark grey car then enters the frame from the right and drives forward, following the silver car's path and positioning itself behind it. Throughout the video, two people remain crouched on the ground to the left, and a portion of another car on the far right remains stationary.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set at night on an upper level of a parking garage, possibly on an exit ramp leading to an open, dark expanse. The ground is dark asphalt, with sections painted green and marked with white directional arrows. Overhead lighting casts a greenish tint across the area. A silver sports car is moving forward and turning right, its circular red taillights illuminated. To the left, a metal staircase ascends alongside a concrete wall. Orange and white traffic cones are placed around the scene. A second, dark-colored sports car with white wheels drives into view from the right, following the silver car. A third, dark, widebody car is partially visible, parked on the far right. In the center background, a green sign with Japanese characters is visible, and a green exit sign is present in the right middle ground.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a wide shot featuring a silver car in the center middle ground. In the middle ground, a green-painted surface with a white directional arrow points toward the foreground. As the camera dollies forward slowly and smoothly, the white directional arrow shifts to the bottom center of the foreground. To the left, two people are crouched near a wall, while the rear of another car is partially visible in the right middle ground. The silver car drives forward and turns right, moving into the background. A dark grey car then enters from the right middle ground, drives forward, and also turns right, moving into the background. The camera continues to move forward, maintaining its position at the subjects' level throughout the clip."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
