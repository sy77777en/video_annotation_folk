  "merged_caption": "This medium shot is framed at the subjects' level, capturing a man with brown skin, long dark dreadlocks, a beard, and a mustache, positioned in the center-left and middle ground, standing behind a kitchen island. He wears a black sweater with a graphic of a brown camel with white decoration and white text on the front. The man speaks while using a knife to chop a carrot on a wooden cutting board. The foreground is entirely occupied by the island, which is covered in a vibrant assortment of fresh produce, including yellow bananas, pineapples, red and green apples, lemons, limes, oranges, and a purple cauliflower. In the background, a woman with brown skin and dark hair pulled back sits on a counter on the right side of the frame, wearing a purple long-sleeved shirt under a pink and red apron. She looks down at a smartphone in her hands, moving her thumb across the screen. A stainless steel double-door refrigerator is located in the center background, with wooden brown shelves on the top left holding various ceramic items and a small potted plant, and wooden upper cabinets on the top right. The scene is set in a modern kitchen with light-colored walls. The camera maintains a static, eye-level shot with a level angle, using deep focus to provide a clear view of both the foreground and background elements, with the man in the midground.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
