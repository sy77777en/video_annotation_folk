  "merged_caption": "The video maintains a medium shot of a middle-aged man with a light skin tone and a beard, wearing a white shirt and a red lanyard with a name tag, positioned slightly left of center in the foreground. He is the primary focus throughout the video, holding a small device in his right hand, possibly a remote or a pointer, and appears to be speaking or presenting with an attentive and engaged expression. To his right, a white projection screen occupies the right third of the frame, situated in the foreground. A dark red wall forms the background on the left, with a wooden element visible in the lower left, also in the background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout the clip, maintaining a deep focus with a large depth of field. There is some minor, very smooth camera movement, panning from right to left. The man speaks, gesturing with his right hand. He then raises his left hand with an open palm, fingers spread, before lowering it and then raising both hands, while continuing to speak and gesture. The scene is set indoors, likely during a presentation or lecture.",

    "Camera": "The camera is at eye level, looking straight ahead. It maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field. There is some minor, very smooth camera movement, panning from right to left.",
    "Subject": "The video features a middle-aged man with a light skin tone and a beard, wearing a white shirt and a red lanyard with a name tag. He is holding a small device in one hand, possibly a remote or a pointer, and appears to be speaking or presenting. His expression is attentive and engaged, suggesting he is addressing an audience or explaining something. The man is positioned slightly to the left of the center in the frame and is the primary focus throughout the video.",
    "Motion": "The man speaks, gesturing with his right hand. He then raises his left hand with an open palm, fingers spread, before lowering it and then raising both hands, while continuing to speak and gesture, holding a small black object in his right hand.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set indoors, likely during a presentation or lecture. To the right, a plain white projection screen occupies approximately one-third of the frame. On the left, a dark red wall forms the backdrop, with a wooden element, possibly part of a lectern or wall paneling, visible in the lower left corner.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
