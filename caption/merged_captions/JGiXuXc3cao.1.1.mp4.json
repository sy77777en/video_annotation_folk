White text boxes displaying the coordinates \"LONG: 50.14\" at the top and \"LAT: 41.46\" on the right of the grid. A white, diamond-shaped compass symbol is fixed in the bottom left corner, and a timestamp in the bottom right corner progresses from \"10:35PM NYC TIME\" to \"12:35AM NYC TIME.\" As the timestamp advances, a dotted red line extends vertically upwards from the central red circle, growing in length while all other on-screen elements remain stationary. The dark, marbled background shifts and swirls slowly beneath the static grid lines. The camera performs a smooth and steady zoom-out, gradually revealing more of the digital navigation interface that displays the Titanic's distress call.",

    "Subject": "A digital interface on a black screen displays a white grid over a dark, marbled background. In the center, the words \"TITANIC DISTRESS CALL\" are shown in glowing red text, next to a pulsating red circle that marks a location. White text boxes on the grid indicate the coordinates \"LONG: 50.14\" and \"LAT: 41.46\". In the bottom right corner, a timestamp progresses from \"10:35PM NYC TIME\" to \"12:35AM NYC TIME\". As time advances, a dotted red line extends vertically upwards from the initial red circle. A white, diamond-shaped compass symbol is visible in the bottom left corner.",

As a timestamp in the bottom right corner advances, a dotted red line extends vertically upwards from the pulsating circle. The dark, marbled background shifts and swirls slowly beneath the static grid lines.",
    "Scene": "A digital display with a dark, subtly textured background is overlaid with a white grid. In the upper-left quadrant, the text \"TITANIC DISTRESS CALL\" appears in red. Additional overlays include white boxes displaying \"LONG: 50.14\" at the top and \"LAT: 41.46\" on the right. A timestamp in the bottom-right corner progresses from \"10:35PM NYC TIME\" to \"12:35AM NYC TIME,\" while a white circular icon with a diamond shape sits in the bottom-left. At the center, a glowing red dot, marking the distress call's origin, extends upward into a vertical dotted red line as time passes on the display.",

In the center-left, red text reads \"TITANIC DISTRESS CALL,\" positioned next to a pulsating red circle in the center of the frame. White text boxes displaying longitude and latitude coordinates are located at the top and right of the grid, respectively. A compass icon is fixed in the bottom left corner, and a timestamp is in the bottom right. As the timestamp advances, a dotted red line extends vertically upwards from the central red circle, growing in length while all other on-screen elements remain stationary, and the camera zooms out."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
