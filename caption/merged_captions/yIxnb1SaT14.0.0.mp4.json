  "merged_caption": "This video features a slow and smooth zoom-in on a cityscape at night, captured from a high, aerial angle. The illuminated Eiffel Tower, standing prominently in the middle ground, is centrally framed against the dark, hazy sky. In the foreground, a large, classically styled building is lit with purple and white lights, situated at the bottom center, aligned with the tower. The sprawling city below is a vast expanse of twinkling lights, creating depth from the foreground to the background. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire cityscape sharp as it performs a slow and smooth zoom-in, gradually moving closer to the Eiffel Tower. The composition emphasizes the grand scale and serene atmosphere of the nocturnal urban environment, with streaks of light from traffic visible on the roads. Stretching out from the base of the Eiffel Tower is a vast expanse of the city, a glittering sea of countless lights from streets and buildings. The scene is captured from a high-angle aerial perspective, looking down on the urban landscape. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays the name \"MATHIEU STANIĆ\" and the word \"CINEMATOGRAPHER\".",

    "Camera": "This is a time-lapse video of Paris at night, captured from a high, aerial angle. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire cityscape sharp. It performs a slow and smooth zoom-in, gradually moving closer to the illuminated Eiffel Tower.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a sweeping aerial cityscape of Paris at night. The iconic Eiffel Tower, illuminated in a warm, golden-yellow hue, stands as the central beacon against the dark, hazy sky. Stretching out from its base is a vast expanse of the city, a glittering sea of countless lights from streets and buildings, with a large, brightly lit classical-style building positioned in the foreground. The composition emphasizes the grand scale and serene atmosphere of the nocturnal urban environment, making the entire cityscape the subject rather than focusing on a single element.",
    "Motion": "This video features a wide-angle scenery shot of Paris at night, with a slow and smooth zoom-in effect. The brightly illuminated Eiffel Tower is the central focus, standing out against the dark sky. The sprawling city below is a vast expanse of twinkling lights, enhancing the serene atmosphere of the scene.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures a high-angle, nighttime view of Paris. The Eiffel Tower stands prominently in the center, its iron lattice structure illuminated by golden lights against the dark, hazy sky. Below and stretching into the distance, the city is a vast expanse of glowing lights. In the foreground, a large, classically styled building is lit with purple and white lights, situated at the head of a long parkway leading to the tower. Streaks of light from traffic are visible on the roads. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays the name \"MATHIEU STANIĆ\" and the word \"CINEMATOGRAPHER\".",
    "Spatial": "This video features a slow and smooth zoom-in on a cityscape at night. The illuminated Eiffel Tower is positioned in the middle ground, centrally framed. In the foreground, a large, lit building is situated at the bottom center, aligned with the tower. The rest of the city, a vast field of lights, extends across the entire frame, creating depth from the foreground to the background. The scene is captured from a high-angle aerial perspective, looking down on the urban landscape."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
