  "merged_caption": "From a bird's-eye view, an orange, amorphous figure resembling a running orangutan is positioned in the center of the frame in the middle ground. The scene is framed by dark, tall walls that form a narrow, maze-like corridor with a solid dark gray-teal floor. In the top left, a white, curved object with red splatters is situated near the left wall, while a simple, light gray rectangular block rests against the right wall in the bottom right, both in the middle ground. The camera smoothly tracks the orange avatar by trucking right with subtle up-and-down movements as it progresses through the dark, abstract environment. As the amorphous orange figure moves forward, its shape continuously morphs and pulsates, occasionally resembling a running form, and it leaves a trail of smaller, dissipating orange particles in its wake. The camera captures the scene with a deep focus, keeping all elements sharp. As the video progresses, the camera follows the central orange figure as it moves forward through the maze-like corridor. Consequently, the surrounding walls and the static white and gray objects scroll past and exit the frame, while new sections of the corridor enter the view, maintaining the central figure's position within the frame. Towards the end of the video, a white humanoid figure appears in the lower right corner.",

    "Camera": "From a bird's-eye view, the camera smoothly tracks the orange avatar by trucking right with subtle up-and-down movements as it progresses. The scene is captured with a deep focus, keeping all elements sharp.",
    "Subject": "The video features a bright orange, amorphous figure that resembles a running orangutan. Its shape is inconsistent, occasionally taking on a vaguely humanoid form.",
    "Motion": "An amorphous orange figure moves forward through a dark, maze-like environment from a top-down perspective. As it travels, its shape continuously morphs and pulsates, occasionally resembling a running form, and it leaves a trail of smaller, dissipating orange particles in its wake.",
    "Scene": "In a gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view, the camera is placed directly above the character and looks down on them as they navigate a dark, abstract environment. The setting consists of a narrow, maze-like corridor with tall, black, textured walls and a solid dark gray-teal floor. An orange, particle-based shape moves forward through the center of the path. To the left, a white, curved object is positioned near a wall marked with red splatters, while a simple, light gray rectangular block is visible on the right. The camera follows the central shape's progression through the angular passages.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
