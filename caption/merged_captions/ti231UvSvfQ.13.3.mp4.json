  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a close-up of a young, fair-skinned man with short, light-colored hair, positioned in the left foreground of a dimly lit indoor setting, likely at night. His head hovers above a surface resembling a desk, which is faintly visible and blends into the darkness. The man appears to be wearing a sweatshirt, though the color is hard to discern due to the desaturated, almost monochromatic color scheme and deep shadows. On his left wrist, he has an object that resembles a bracelet, but it is not clearly identifiable against the blurred background. His hand is visible in the center-right foreground. Initially, the man has his head lowered, but he lifts his head and turns to look toward the right side of the scene, his eyes wide and his mouth slightly open. His face is partially obscured by shadow. In the out-of-focus background, featuring the silhouette of electronic equipment, a vertical white light shifts slightly from the upper-right quadrant to just right of the center. The camera, positioned at the subject's level throughout the shot, maintains a shallow focus on the man in the foreground and tilts up slightly, capturing the movement as he lifts his head. The shot is slightly unsteady, contributing to the dynamic feel of the scene.",

    "Camera": "This is a slightly unsteady, ground-level shot with a level angle. The camera maintains a shallow focus on the man in the foreground as it tilts up slightly.",
    "Subject": "In a dimly lit setting, a young, fair-skinned man with short, light-colored hair is shown in a close-up. He appears to be wearing a sweatshirt, though the color is hard to discern due to the lighting. On his left wrist, he has an object that resembles a bracelet, but it is not clearly identifiable against the blurred background. Initially seen with his head down on a surface, he lifts his head to look towards the right, his eyes wide and his mouth slightly open. His face is partially obscured by shadow.",
    "Motion": "A man, initially with his head lowered, lifts his head and turns to look toward the right.",
    "Scene": "The scene unfolds in a dimly lit indoor setting, likely at night, with a desaturated, almost monochromatic color scheme and deep shadows. In the foreground, a surface resembling a desk is faintly visible, blending into the darkness. The background is out of focus, featuring the silhouette of electronic equipment and a single, narrow vertical white light.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a close-up of a man positioned in the left foreground, his head hovering above a surface. His hand is visible in the center-right foreground. He then lifts his head, which remains in the left half of the frame, and turns to look toward the right side of the scene. In the out-of-focus background, a vertical white light shifts slightly from the upper-right quadrant to just right of the center. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
