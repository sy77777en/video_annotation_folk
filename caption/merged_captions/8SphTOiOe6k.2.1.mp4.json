  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot capturing a bustling street scene that extends from the foreground into the background. Traditional wooden buildings line the left side of the frame, extending into the middle ground, while a stone-paved sidewalk runs along the right side, where a small group of people is visible, adding a sense of activity. The camera is at street level, providing a first-person perspective. In the middle ground, a bus is seen moving towards the background, enhancing the urban setting. A lush green tree and a stone bridge are located on the right, contributing to the natural charm. From a level-angle, eye-level perspective, the camera moves forward slightly unsteadily with some shaking. It then pans right, and continues moving forward to approach a large wooden-framed sign in the middle ground, which displays a vibrant landscape image of a lush landscape with a clear sky, mountains, and greenery. This sign becomes the central point of interest, positioned centrally in the frame, with the camera at eye level to the sign. The transition from the street scene to the sign shifts the viewer's focus from the broader environment to a specific cultural element. The video presents a serene outdoor setting in a quaint town during the day under a clear blue sky with scattered clouds. The environment features a street lined with traditional wooden buildings, some with red accents, and a stone-paved sidewalk. A small group of people is visible, walking along the street and sidewalk, adding a sense of quiet activity. The overall atmosphere is calm and inviting, with a blend of natural and architectural elements. The camera employs deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping both foreground and background elements sharp.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
