  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide shot of an outdoor patio scene, captured from a high angle. The shot focuses on the scenery rather than a specific subject. Initially, a round, dark wicker table with a reflective glass top is in the center-right middle ground, with the back of a matching dark wicker chair in the bottom-center foreground. In the background, two grey lounge chairs rest against a plain white wall on the right, while a sandy area with a tree and green foliage occupies the top-left. The video begins with an unsteady upward tilt of the camera, followed by a pan to the left, capturing the patio's tranquil and private relaxation space. The camera's perspective is meant to immerse the viewer in the setting, highlighting the arrangement of the dark, glass-topped table, chairs with black backs and grey cushions, and grey loungers on a concrete patio that borders a sandy area with tropical plants. The camera slowly pans to the left, shifting the table and chair toward the right edge of the frame. This movement brings the sandy area, foliage, and square stepping stones from the left side to fill the center and left portions of the view. A small, square white box sits on the table, adding a subtle detail to the composition. The lighting is soft and even, suggesting a shaded location. From an eye-level, high-angle perspective, a deep focus is used, keeping the patio furniture and the sandy area behind it sharp throughout the movement. The scene composition and environment are designed to establish the atmosphere and environment of the location, with the camera movements enhancing the immersive experience.",

    "Scene": "A slow pan reveals an outdoor patio during the day, featuring a grey concrete floor adjacent to an area of light-colored sand with a tree and green foliage. A round, dark wicker table with a reflective glass top sits on the concrete, holding a small, square white box. A matching dark wicker chair is positioned at the table. In the background, two grey lounge chairs rest against a plain white wall, and square stepping stones are visible on the sand. The lighting is soft and even, suggesting a shaded location.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
