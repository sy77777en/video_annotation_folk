  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a close-up shot of a humanoid figure with brown hair and light skin, wearing a dark grey shirt, positioned on the left side of the frame, seated at a light brown wooden desk that extends from the foreground to the background. The figure's left hand rests on a black keyboard, some keys of which are lit green, and their right hand is on the mouse, with no noticeable movement. A black computer monitor displaying lines of white code on a dark background is in the center-right middle ground. To the left of the monitor, in the background, are a black computer tower with a glowing blue light and an attached light-colored sticky note, and a black speaker. A blue and silver rectangular object with rounded edges is visible on the far right in the middle ground. The camera begins at eye level, looking straight ahead with deep focus on the person at the computer. It then smoothly moves slightly backward, quickly tilts down, and moves downward to a ground-level, high-angle view, transitioning to a close-up shot of a brown, rectangular cardboard box on the floor, which fills most of the frame in the foreground. A white rectangular shipping label is centered on the box in the foreground, featuring black text, a barcode, and a \"P\" logo for Priority Mail. The label indicates \"PRIORITY MAIL 2-DAY\" and shows the sender as \"David Pokora, 2597 Hensall St, MISSISSAUGA, ONTARIO\" and the recipient as \"Justin May, 123 MAPLE DRIVE, WILMINGTON DE 19801,\" dated \"12/19/2016,\" and includes a USPS tracking number. The overlay also includes text labeled \"Fictional address\" in the upper right corner and another labeled \"[9]\" in the lower left corner. The movement is very smooth, accompanied by a slight counterclockwise roll, with the blurred wooden floor visible in the background.",

    "Subject": "The video initially shows a humanoid figure with brown hair and light skin, wearing a dark grey shirt, sitting at a wooden desk with their left hand resting on a black keyboard. The figure faces a black computer monitor displaying lines of white code on a dark background.

    "Scene": "The video begins in a dimly lit room, focusing on a mannequin-like figure with brown hair sitting at a light brown wooden desk and typing on a black keyboard, some keys of which are lit green. A black computer monitor on the desk displays white lines of code against a dark background. To the left of the monitor, a black computer tower with a glowing blue light and an attached light-colored sticky note stands beside a black speaker. A blue and silver rectangular object with rounded edges is positioned to the right of the monitor. The camera then moves backward, tilts down, and finally moves downward, shifting focus to a cardboard box on the floor. An overlay of a white shipping label with black text, tinged red by the ambient lighting, is prominent on the box. This label details \"PRIORITY MAIL 2-DAY,\" with sender \"David Pokora\" in Mississauga, Ontario, and recipient \"Justin May\" in Wilmington, DE, dated \"12/19/2016,\" and includes a USPS tracking number. The overlay also includes text labeled \"Fictional address\" in the upper right corner and another labeled \"[9]\" in the lower left corner.",
    "Spatial": "The video opens with a close-up shot of a humanoid figure positioned on the left side of the frame, seated at a wooden desk that extends from the foreground to the background. A computer monitor displaying code is in the center-right middle ground, with a keyboard initially at the bottom center in the middle ground, which exits the frame from the top as the camera moves. To the left of the monitor, in the background, are a computer tower and a speaker. A rectangular object with rounded edges is visible on the far right in the middle ground. The camera then pulls back slightly, tilts downward, and moves downward, transitioning to a close-up shot of a cardboard box on the floor, which fills most of the frame in the foreground.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
