  "merged_caption": "The scene begins from an overhead, upside-down high angle, capturing a woman with dark skin and braided hair actively jumping rope. She consistently wears a textured, light-colored sleeveless dress over a white spaghetti strap top, red leggings, and gold shoes. Two thick, white ropes swing dynamically as the camera performs a smooth, 360-degree craning arc around her, stretching from the middle ground to the foreground while maintaining her position at the center vertical band. The surroundings include a dry, grassy landscape with light brown dirt and sparse, yellowish vegetation under a vibrant blue sky with scattered white clouds, creating a dynamic backdrop. Initially, the camera is at a high angle and upside down, but as she jumps, the camera cranes down to a ground-level worm's eye view, capturing her against the blue sky. The camera continues its arc back to the starting high-angle position, completing the rotation and returning to an upside-down perspective. The entire scene is kept in sharp focus with a large depth of field, and the shot is visually warped by noticeable fisheye distortion. The playback speed shifts between fast and slow due to a speed ramp effect, enhancing the dynamic motion of the ropes and the woman's movements. The woman remains centered between the ropes throughout the video, with the camera fixed on the ropes that she is jumping with, moving in a 360-degree crane around her. The video begins with a high, upside-down angle, and as the camera rotates, the arid, hilly terrain appears at the top of the view while the blue sky with scattered white clouds is at the bottom. By the end, the camera angle changes, completing the rotation and returning to an upside-down perspective.",

    "Subject": "A woman with dark skin and braided hair is holding onto two thick, white ropes with her arms outstretched. She consistently wears a textured, light-colored sleeveless dress over a white spaghetti strap top, red leggings, and gold shoes. As she jumps, the camera moves around her.",
    "Motion": "A woman stands on a dirt path holding two thick ropes with her arms outstretched. She jumps, prompting the camera to crane down 360 degrees around her. Initially, the camera is at a high angle and upside down, but it finishes right-side up, capturing her against the blue sky.",
    "Scene": "A person is holding two thick, white, twisted ropes over a dry, grassy landscape. The ground below consists of light brown dirt and sparse, yellowish vegetation under a bright daytime sky, with the person remaining centered between the ropes. The camera is fixed on the ropes that the woman is jumping with, moving in a 360-degree crane around her. The video begins with a high, upside-down angle, and as the camera rotates, the arid, hilly terrain appears at the top of the view while the blue sky with scattered white clouds is at the bottom. By the end, the camera angle changes, completing the rotation and returning to an upside-down perspective.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
