  "merged_caption": "The video begins with an extreme wide shot, where a light brown, unpaved path occupies the foreground center, extending into the middle ground. Rolling green fields flank the path on both the left and right, stretching from the foreground to the background. A prominent group of green trees is positioned in the middle ground left, with additional scattered trees and a more distant tree line visible in the background. The bright blue sky, dotted with white clouds, fills the top portion of the frame in the background. As the camera moves forward along the path, the foreground elements gradually disappear from the frame, while the trees and fields initially in the middle ground and background move into the foreground and middle ground. The more distant sky and expansive fields gradually come into view. The trees initially in the middle ground left shift further left and eventually exit the frame on the left side. During this movement, the drone executes a complete 360-degree backward roll, causing the scene to rotate downward in a circular blur before stabilizing at a high-angle perspective. After this maneuver, the drone continues its forward movement along the path. The video exhibits mild barrel distortion, and the camera maintains deep focus throughout. The drone glides forward from an eye-level starting point; midway, it executes a smooth 360-degree backward flip, transitioning the view from eye level to a worm’s-eye angle, through an upside-down horizon, and finally settling into a high-angle perspective. The scene is characterized by rolling green fields, some appearing as cultivated land and others as grassy meadows, under a bright blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds. The rapid movement further contributes to an immersive experience of the landscape itself, emphasizing the atmosphere and scale of the natural setting.",

    "Subject": "This is a landscape scenery shot. There is no main subject because the focus is on capturing the expansive rural environment, characterized by rolling green fields, scattered trees, a dirt path, and a bright blue sky with fluffy white clouds, emphasizing the atmosphere and scale of the natural setting rather than a specific object or entity. The rapid movement further contributes to an immersive experience of the landscape itself.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a view of a lush green field under a clear blue sky with scattered clouds, with a dirt path winding through the field. The camera moves forward along the path, capturing the greenery and trees on either side. As the camera continues to move, it tilts backward, rotating the scenery downward in a full 360-degree circle, creating a dynamic sense of motion. The camera then stabilizes, and the view returns to the original clear view of the green field, trees, and the dirt path.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures a daytime journey along a light brown, unpaved path that winds through a sunlit rural landscape. The scene is characterized by rolling green fields, some appearing as cultivated land and others as grassy meadows, under a bright blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds. Groups of green, leafy trees are scattered throughout, bordering the fields and path, with the drone's forward movement creating a sense of progression through this pastoral setting.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
