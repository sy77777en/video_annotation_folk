  "merged_caption": "The video features an extreme wide shot of a lush, mountainous landscape. The dense forest of evergreen trees occupies the foreground and middle ground, stretching across the bottom and center of the frame. The mountain peaks, partially shrouded in mist, are positioned in the middle ground and background, extending from the left to the center. The sky, with its partly cloudy appearance, forms the background, occupying the top portion of the frame. The camera, positioned at a high elevation, captures the scene from above, emphasizing the vastness and scale of the landscape. The drone's movement provides a sweeping view, maintaining a consistent framing of the expansive environment. The video begins with a view of a dense forest covering a mountain slope, with clouds partially obscuring the peaks. As the camera moves forward, a winding road becomes visible, cutting through the forest and leading up the mountain. The sky is partly cloudy, with patches of blue visible through the clouds. The camera continues to move forward, providing a broader view of the forested mountain and the road snaking through it. The video, filmed by a drone, captures a sweeping view of a lush, mountainous landscape during the day. The scene is set outdoors, showcasing a dense forest of evergreen trees covering the rolling hills. Mist gently drifts over the mountain peaks, adding a dynamic element to the serene environment. The vibrant green of the trees contrasts with the soft white clouds, creating a picturesque natural setting. The drone's perspective provides a broad, elevated view, emphasizing the vastness and tranquility of the forested mountains. The deep focus ensures all elements, from the trees in the foreground to the distant clouds, remain sharp and clear.",

    "Camera": "The video features an aerial-level camera moving smoothly forward with a level angle, capturing a landscape of forested mountains. The deep focus ensures all elements, from the trees in the foreground to the distant clouds, remain sharp and clear.",
    "Subject": "The video is a landscape scenery shot. It captures a vast expanse of lush, green forested mountains under a bright, partly cloudy sky. The focus is on the expansive environment, highlighting the dense tree coverage and the mist gently rolling over the mountain peaks. The emphasis is on the natural beauty and scale of the landscape, rather than any specific object, creating an atmosphere of tranquility and grandeur.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
