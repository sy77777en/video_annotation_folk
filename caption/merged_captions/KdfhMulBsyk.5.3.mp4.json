  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot, the camera positioned at the subjects' level, showing four figures from behind in a dark environment dominated by intense red lighting originating from the front. The main subject is a tall man positioned centrally, wearing a dark coat and facing away from the viewer. To his left stands a woman with short blonde hair, dressed in a white and dark suit featuring a distinct symbol on the back. To the right of the central man are two other figures, also facing away: one with dark, voluminous hair and another wearing a jacket with short dark hair. The jacket has a hood. A red, U-shaped neon structure, possibly symbolizing a spider icon, is visible in the center background. The figures stand still in an elevator, facing a wall illuminated by red light. Initially, there is a red spider emblem on the wall in front of them. The camera then shifts to an overhead position, looking down on the subjects as they appear to descend. The camera executes a very smooth craning up movement in an arc. As they begin to descend, the spider emblem becomes no longer visible. Concurrently, the U-shaped neon structure in the background vanishes, and the surroundings darken, with faint, thin, vertical red lines becoming visible at the top of the frame, while the figures are centrally positioned in the middle ground. The movement of the figure makes it challenging to assess the focus, and the depth of field appears insufficient to ensure clarity. The figures remain in their positions as the surroundings turn completely dark.",

    "Camera": "The camera begins at eye level and transitions to a bird's-eye view. The movement of the figure makes it challenging to assess the focus, and the depth of field appears insufficient to ensure clarity. The camera executes a very smooth craning up movement in an arc.",
    "Subject": "The video shows four figures standing from behind in a dark environment dominated by intense red lighting originating from the front. The main subject is a tall man positioned centrally, wearing a dark coat and facing away from the viewer.

To the right of the central man are two other figures, also facing away: one with dark, voluminous hair and another wearing a jacket with short dark hair. The jacket has a hood. All figures are silhouetted against the red light.",
    "Motion": "The four figures stand still in an elevator, facing a wall illuminated by red light. Initially, there is a red spider emblem on the wall in front of them. As they begin to descend, the spider emblem becomes no longer visible. The figures remain in their positions as the surroundings turn completely dark.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set indoors, bathed in a strong red light, possibly inside an elevator. In the background, a prominent, glowing red, U-shaped neon structure, resembling a spider icon, illuminates the space. Silhouettes of four figures are visible, facing away from the viewer towards this light. As the video progresses, the figures appear to descend, the spider-like icon disappears, and the surroundings become dark, with some faint, thin, vertical red lines visible in the darkness above them.",
    "Spatial": "The video opens with a medium shot, the camera positioned at the subjects' level, showing four figures from behind, with the woman with short dark hair to the tall man's right appearing in the foreground. A tall man stands in the center, flanked by a blonde woman to his left and two other figures to his right. A red, U-shaped neon structure, possibly symbolizing a spider icon, is visible in the center background. The camera then shifts to an overhead position, looking down on the subjects as they appear to descend. Concurrently, the U-shaped neon structure in the background vanishes, and the surroundings darken, with faint, thin, vertical red lines becoming visible at the top of the frame, while the figures are centrally positioned in the middle ground."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
