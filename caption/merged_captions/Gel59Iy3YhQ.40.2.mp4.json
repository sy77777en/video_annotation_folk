  "merged_caption": "From a first-person perspective, a dark, textured arm in the foreground extends upward toward the center-left of the frame, where an open book with a light-colored cover rests on a high shelf in the middle ground. The book's open pages feature black text covered with large, detailed illustrations of reddish-brown butterfly wings. A hand grips a golden handle in the center of the book and pushes it upward. Both hands then push the entire bookshelf section upward and backward, causing the shelf to rotate and reveal a hidden, narrow passage. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp, and begins with a slight upward tilt, pauses briefly, and then performs a minimal zoom out. As the bookshelf rotates away, the viewpoint tilts down, looking into the passage. The passage is framed by two curved, metallic-looking rails standing upright along the wall, and the view shows dark wooden walls with a line of bricks on both sides. The passage recedes into the background, ending at a dark wall with a small, rectangular window that casts a faint light in the distance. The smooth camera movement concludes by tilting up and then down, revealing the hidden passage behind the bookshelf.",

    "Camera": "From an eye-level, level-angle perspective, the shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The smooth camera movement begins with a slight upward tilt, pauses briefly, and then performs a minimal zoom out. It concludes by tilting up and then down, revealing a hidden passage behind the bookshelf.",
    "Subject": "In a dimly lit, first-person perspective, a dark, textured arm reaches toward an open book on a high shelf. The book has a light-colored cover and its open pages feature black text covered with large, detailed illustrations of reddish-brown butterfly wings. There is a rectangular hollow in the lower middle part of the book, with a golden handle in the center. A hand grips the handle and pushes it upward, then continues to push the bookshelf, causing the bookshelf to rotate upward. This action reveals a hidden, narrow passage, through which the view shows dark wooden walls with a line of bricks on both sides and two curved, metallic-looking rails standing upright along the wall.",
    "Motion": "From a first-person perspective, a dark, textured arm reaches up toward a high shelf, and a hand grips a golden handle set within an open book. The hand pushes the handle and the entire bookshelf upward, causing the shelf to rotate and reveal a hidden passage. The viewpoint then tilts downward to look into the narrow, dark passage.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, is set within a dimly lit room lined with dark wooden bookshelves. On an upper shelf, an open book is propped up, with large, reddish-brown butterfly wings attached to its pages. A dark, textured arm reaches out to grip the handle in the open book, pushing it upward, while both hands together push a section of the bookshelf, causing it to slide upward and backward, revealing a narrow, dark passage. The view then moves to peer down into the passage, where a faint light can be seen in the distance, coming from a small rectangular window.",
    "Spatial": "From a first-person perspective, a dark, textured arm in the foreground extends upward toward the center-left of the frame, where an open book rests on a shelf in the middle ground. A hand grips a handle in the center of the book and pushes it, before two hands push the entire bookshelf section upward and backward. This section, which occupied the middle ground, rotates away, revealing a dark, narrow passage in the center of the frame. The viewpoint then tilts down, looking into the passage. Two curved, metallic rails enter the middle ground, framing the view down the long passage that recedes into the background, ending at a dark wall with a small, rectangular window that casts a small, faint light in the distance on it."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
