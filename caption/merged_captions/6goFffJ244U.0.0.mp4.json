  "merged_caption": "The video features an abstract scene with numerous circular light patterns resembling bokeh effects. These circles vary in size and intensity, displaying warm hues of gold, orange, and yellow. The lights are scattered across the frame, creating a sense of depth and movement. The circles are distributed throughout the frame, with some positioned in the foreground and others in the middle ground and background, contributing to a layered effect. The lights appear to float and overlap, with some moving slightly from left to right or top to bottom, enhancing the dynamic composition. The camera maintains a consistent height relative to the lights, capturing the scene from a straight-on perspective. The overall composition is visually rich, with the glowing circles providing a soft, radiant contrast against the dark backdrop. The video showcases a series of glowing circles in warm tones, including shades of gold, orange, and yellow, floating and drifting against a dark background. The circles vary in size and intensity, creating a dynamic and visually engaging scene. The lights appear to move subtly, giving the impression of a gentle, continuous motion throughout the frames. The video is static with no camera movement. The lights are predominantly warm hues of gold and amber, creating a shimmering effect. The lights appear to float and gently shift, suggesting a sense of motion. The overall atmosphere is ambient and visually dynamic, with the lights providing a soft, radiant contrast against the dark backdrop. The overall composition is dynamic, with the glowing circles appearing to float and overlap, contributing to a visually rich and textured appearance.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
