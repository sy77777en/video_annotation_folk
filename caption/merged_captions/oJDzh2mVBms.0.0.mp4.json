  "merged_caption": "This is an extreme wide shot of a winter landscape at twilight. The bottom half of the frame is occupied by a snow-covered field that extends from the foreground to the background, with a path starting at the bottom center and center-right, receding toward the horizon. A dark silhouette of a coniferous forest stretches across the background, positioned along the lower third of the frame. The upper two-thirds of the frame consist of the sky, which displays a color gradient from a band of orange light at the horizon to deep blue at the top. A single, bright celestial body is located in the upper-center-left of the frame. This is a time-lapse video of a winter sunset, captured from a low angle at ground level. The shot is completely static, and a deep focus is used, keeping the entire scene, from the snowy foreground to the distant treeline and the sky, in sharp detail. As night falls, the sky gradually darkens, and the bright celestial body, possibly a planet or the moon, moves slowly rightward and downward. The landscape itself remains static throughout the clip. Along the distant horizon, a thin band of orange and yellow light from the set sun backlights the dense silhouette of coniferous trees.",

    "Camera": "This is a time-lapse video of a winter sunset. The shot is completely static, captured from a low angle at ground level. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire scene, from the snowy foreground to the distant treeline and the sky, in sharp detail.",
    "Subject": "This is a tranquil landscape scenery shot of a winter evening. The video presents a wide, snow-covered field under a deep blue twilight sky, where a single, brilliant celestial body, possibly a planet or the moon, shines brightly. Along the distant horizon, a thin band of orange and yellow light from the set sun backlights a dense silhouette of coniferous trees. A snow-covered path with visible tracks cuts through the foreground and stretches into the background.",
    "Motion": "This scenic video captures a serene, snowy landscape at twilight, featuring a snow-covered road or field leading toward a distant line of silhouetted coniferous trees. The sky displays a beautiful gradient, shifting from a warm orange glow at the horizon to a deep, dark blue above, where a single bright planet or star is prominent. This is a time-lapse shot, and as night falls, the sky slowly darkens, and the bright planet appears to move rightward and downward. The landscape itself remains static throughout the clip.",
    "Scene": "In a serene outdoor setting at twilight, a vast, snow-covered landscape unfolds under a gradient sky that shifts from deep blue at its zenith to a warm orange glow along the horizon. A single, bright celestial body is visible in the upper sky. A dark silhouette of a coniferous forest stretches across the horizon. In the foreground, a path with tracks cuts through the deep, white snow, leading toward the distant trees.",

The camera remains static at a low height relative to the snowy ground."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
