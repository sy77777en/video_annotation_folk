  "merged_caption": "This high-angle wide shot presents a third-person 3D game scene set in a quaint, outdoor garden environment at night, with a scarecrow-like character positioned in the middle ground, slightly right of center. The character has a round, orange pumpkin for a head with a simple, carved smiling face and wears a blue, hooded cloak with a light-colored belt on the chest. To the character's left is a partially fenced garden plot with 13 mature, leafy green plants, and to the right is another fenced plot containing several small, withered-looking saplings. Both plots are situated in the middle ground, bordered by a white picket fence, and the ground is covered with a mix of grass and soil. A portion of a house is visible in the background at the top of the frame, while a game interface occupies the foreground at the bottom, showing various icons and a numerical counter. The garden's soil is dark and freshly tilled, surrounded by patches of green grass and a few decorative stones lining the paths. The overall atmosphere is calm and pastoral, with a warm color palette enhancing the serene rural setting. The camera, captured from a high, overhead angle, maintains a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp and smoothly tracks the character's movement. The scarecrow-like character walks from the plot of mature green plants to the adjacent plot containing withered saplings, moving to each of the small plants. As the character approaches, a faint blue, sparkling aura becomes visible around the saplings. The character stops at the right side of the plot with the saplings, and the camera continues to track this movement throughout the action.",

    "Camera": "This video is captured from a high, overhead angle, maintaining a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp. The camera smoothly tracks the character—a figure in a blue cloak with a pumpkin for a head—as it moves around the garden plots.",
    "Subject": "A scarecrow-like character with a round, orange pumpkin for a head stands in a garden. The pumpkin head has a simple, carved smiling face with oval eyes and a curved mouth. The character's body consists of thin, stick-like limbs, and it wears a blue, hooded cloak with a light-colored belt on the chest. In one garden plot, there are 13 mature, leafy green plants. In an adjacent plot, there are several small, withered-looking saplings, and a faint blue, sparkling aura becomes visible around them when the character approaches.",
    "Motion": "A scarecrow-like character with a pumpkin head walks from a plot of mature green plants to an adjacent plot containing withered saplings. It moves to each of the small plants, and a blue, sparkling aura materializes around them.",
    "Scene": "The video depicts a third-person 3D game scene set in a quaint, outdoor garden environment at night. The setting features a small, partially enclosed garden with neatly arranged rows of plants. The garden is bordered by a white picket fence, and the ground is covered with a mix of grass and soil. The character, visible on screen, is engaged in tending to the garden, moving between the rows of plants. The garden's soil is dark and freshly tilled. Surrounding the garden are patches of green grass and a few decorative stones lining the paths. The overall atmosphere is calm and pastoral, with a warm color palette enhancing the serene rural setting. Overlay elements include a heads-up display at the bottom of the screen, showing various icons and a numerical counter, which are not part of the scene itself.",
    "Spatial": "This high-angle wide shot presents a garden scene with a scarecrow-like character positioned in the middle ground, slightly right of center. To the character's left is a partially fenced garden plot with mature plants, and to the right is another fenced plot containing small saplings, both situated in the middle ground. A portion of a house is visible in the background at the top of the frame, while a game interface occupies the foreground at the bottom. The character walks to the right, entering the plot with the saplings and stopping at its right side. The camera tracks the character's movement throughout this action."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
