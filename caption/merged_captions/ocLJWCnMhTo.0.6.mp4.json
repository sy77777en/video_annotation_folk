  "merged_caption": "In a full shot, two human subjects are positioned in the center of the frame, with one in the foreground-left and the other in the middle ground-right, both standing on a black and white checkered floor that occupies the bottom of the scene. The darker-skinned individual in the foreground-left wears a white T-shirt and a green hat, holding a long piece of red fabric in his left hand while extending his right arm to grasp the shoulders of the lighter-skinned individual in the middle ground-right. This second person is dressed in a white T-shirt, black pants, and a black baseball cap, extending his hands forward to also hold the red fabric. Bright orange, swirling light trails resembling sparks move through the foreground and middle ground around the subjects as they interact. The camera, initially at the subjects' eye level, begins from a slightly high angle and cranes upward in a vertical arc around the frozen figures, transitioning from an eye-level view to a bird's-eye perspective directly above them. This dynamic camera movement creates a rotating visual effect, enhancing the sense of motion and inversion as the scene progresses. The perspective shifts to a high-angle view, causing the entire scene to rotate until the subjects appear upside down in the frame, with the checkered floor now positioned at the top. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The indoor environment features light-colored walls adorned with framed pictures, and a black vertical railing stands prominently at the center. The video has a grainy, vintage aesthetic and is presented within black letterbox framing, with bright orange, spark-like, squiggly lines flickering across the scene.",

    "Camera": "This unsteady shot cranes up in an arc around two people. It begins from a slightly high angle, eye-level perspective and cranes upward to a bird's-eye view directly above them. The camera continues its arc, finishing at a level but upside-down angle. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "A darker-skinned individual, wearing a white T-shirt and a green hat, holds a long piece of red fabric in his left hand while extending his right arm to grasp the shoulders of another lighter-skinned individual. The second person, dressed in a white T-shirt, black pants, and a black baseball cap, extends his hands forward, also holding a piece of the red fabric. Bright orange, swirling light trails resembling sparks move around the two individuals as they interact.",
    "Motion": "Initially, two individuals are in a static pose, with one person placing their right hand on the other's shoulder. As the scene unfolds, the camera arcs upward around them, transitioning from an eye-level view to a bird's-eye perspective, and ultimately ending at an inverted angle. This dynamic camera movement creates a rotating visual effect, enhancing the sense of motion and inversion as the scene progresses.",
    "Scene": "This indoor scene features a black and white checkered floor and light-colored walls adorned with framed pictures. At the center, a black vertical railing stands prominently. Two individuals appear frozen in time, with one resting their right hand on the other's shoulder, both holding a long piece of flowing red fabric. The camera moves in an upward arc around them, enhancing the dynamic composition. The video has a grainy, vintage aesthetic and is presented within black letterbox framing, with bright orange, spark-like, squiggly lines flickering across the scene.",
    "Spatial": "In a full shot, two human subjects are positioned in the center of the frame, with one in the foreground-left and the other in the middle ground-right, both standing on a checkered floor that occupies the bottom of the scene. Swirling orange light trails move through the foreground and middle ground around the subjects. The camera, initially at the subjects' eye level, cranes upward in a vertical arc around the frozen figures. This movement shifts the perspective to a high-angle view, causing the entire scene to rotate until the subjects appear upside down in the frame, with the checkered floor now positioned at the top."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
