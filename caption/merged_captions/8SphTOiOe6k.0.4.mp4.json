  "merged_caption": "This wide shot captures a dynamic street scene from an eye-level perspective in a Japanese town on a sunny day. The camera, slightly unsteady and handheld, maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire street scene sharp. It begins by simultaneously panning to the right and moving forward along the side of the street, before stopping the rightward pan and continuing to move forward. In the bottom right foreground, a man and a woman are seen from behind, initially walking away from the camera along the right side of the road. The woman has long, dark hair and is wearing a beige trench coat over a patterned dress with brown ankle boots. The man next to her has short, dark hair and is wearing a dark-colored suit jacket, dark trousers, a black backpack, and a white face mask. They both stop, and the man turns to his right to look at a display of umbrellas. The woman also stops, turns her head to the right, and steps forward towards the right side of the frame to examine the umbrellas more closely, raising her hand to her face. The display of colorful Japanese-style umbrellas, mostly in shades of pink and purple, is propped against a bamboo screen. The street extends into the distance, flanked by traditional wooden buildings with tiled roofs on the left and right in the middle ground. In the background, a mountain is visible under a blue sky with white clouds. Other pedestrians are visible walking in both directions along the street. A red circular \"Do Not Enter\" sign is visible on a utility pole. As the clip plays, the couple moves further into the scene, with the woman briefly turning her head towards the umbrellas.",

    "Subject": "This video features several pedestrians on a street in Japan. In the foreground, a man and a woman walk together along the right side of the road. The woman has long, dark hair and is wearing a beige trench coat over a patterned dress with brown ankle boots. The man next to her has short, dark hair and is wearing a dark-colored suit jacket, dark trousers, and a black backpack; he also wears a white face mask. In the background, other pedestrians are visible walking along the street. On the right side of the frame, a display of open umbrellas, mostly in shades of pink and purple, stands against a bamboo wall.",
    "Motion": "A man and a woman walk away from the camera along the sidewalk on the right side of a street. They both stop, and the man turns to his right to look at a display of umbrellas. The woman also stops, turns her head to the right, and steps forward towards the right side of the frame to examine the umbrellas more closely, raising her hand to her face. In the background, other pedestrians walk in both directions along the street.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a walk down a paved street in a Japanese town on a sunny day. The street is lined with traditional wooden buildings featuring tiled roofs, set against a backdrop of a distant, tree-covered mountain under a blue sky with white clouds. On the right side of the road, a display of colorful Japanese-style umbrellas, including purple and pink ones, is propped against a bamboo screen. A red circular \"Do Not Enter\" sign is visible on a utility pole, and a couple walks ahead on the narrow shoulder of the road, with the man wearing a dark suit jacket.",
    "Spatial": "This wide shot captures a dynamic street scene from an eye-level perspective. The camera pans to the right and moves forward, following the action. In the bottom right foreground, a man and a woman are seen from behind, initially walking away from the camera along the right side of the road. They then turn to the right, facing and moving towards a display of pink and purple umbrellas positioned in the foreground. The street extends into the distance, flanked by traditional buildings on the left and right in the middle ground. In the background, a mountain is visible under a blue sky. Other pedestrians can be seen walking in the middle ground. As the clip plays, the couple moves further into the scene, with the woman briefly turning her head towards the umbrellas."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
