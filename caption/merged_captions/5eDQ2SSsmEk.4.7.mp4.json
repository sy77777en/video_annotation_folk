  "merged_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of a man with a medium skin tone and short dark hair, who has a beard and mustache, capturing him from the chest up. He is wearing a dark leather jacket, adding to the subdued color palette. Initially, he is positioned on the right in the frame, looking towards the left and down at a folder-like item he holds with both hands in a dimly lit environment. The folder is in the foreground, closer to the bottom left of the frame. As he opens the folder, his hands move slightly, bringing the folder into clearer view in the foreground. The lighting casts shadows on his face, highlighting his features and the texture of the jacket. After examining the contents with a focused expression, he shifts his gaze upward and places the folder at the top left corner of the frame. The man remains in the same general area throughout the sequence, with the camera maintaining a steady position at his eye level. The video is shot at eye level with a low angle, looking up at the man in the midground. The camera is fixed with a slight unsteadiness and maintains a shallow depth of field, focusing on the man. The camera is also at a fixed Dutch angle throughout the video. The background consists of dimly lit, indistinct shapes, suggesting a confined indoor space with dark walls, creating a shadowy atmosphere. The time of day is indeterminate due to the low light, but the scene suggests an evening or nighttime setting. The lighting emphasizes the man and the folder while keeping the background subdued. There are no significant changes in the camera angle or height during the sequence.",

    "Subject": "The video features a man with a medium skin tone and short dark hair, who has a beard and mustache. He is wearing a dark leather jacket and is seen holding a folder-like item, which he opens to view its contents. His expression is focused as he examines the folder briefly. After inspecting it, he looks up and places the folder at the top left of the frame. The lighting casts shadows on his face, highlighting his features.",
    "Motion": "A man is holding a folder-like item with both hands, examining its contents in a dimly lit environment. He continues to look at the item. The man then looks up and places the item at the top left of the frame.",
    "Scene": "The video depicts an indoor setting with dim, moody lighting, creating a shadowy atmosphere. The environment appears to be a confined space, possibly a room with dark walls. The time of day is indeterminate due to the low light, but the scene suggests an evening or nighttime setting. Notable visual elements include a person holding an object, possibly food, with a focused expression. The person is wearing a dark leather jacket, adding to the subdued color palette. The lighting casts soft shadows, highlighting the texture of the jacket and the person's features. The overall scene conveys a sense of quiet introspection within a confined, dimly lit space.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
