  "merged_caption": "The video begins from a first-person perspective, with the character holding a dark pistol in the right foreground. The primary character is a light-skinned, middle-aged man with dark brown hair, a full beard, and a mustache, dressed in a dark long coat over a vest and white shirt. In the center middle ground, a second man, a dark-skinned, middle-aged man with short black hair, is visible from head to toe. He is wearing a formal dark suit, a light gray vest, a white shirt, a white bow tie, and black round sunglasses, standing with one hand on his chest. A large, ornate blue-and-white vase sits in the background, and a wooden door with a brass handle is on the far left. The camera moves forward, pans left, and arcs counterclockwise, repositioning the second man into the left middle ground. This movement reveals a wooden side table with a candlestick-style telephone in the center middle ground and a cream-colored chair in the bottom foreground. Framed portraits of men are visible in both the foreground and background. The space is dimly lit with dark green walls and a herringbone-patterned wood floor, illuminated by a single wall sconce. The camera, shot from a smooth, eye-level perspective, moves slightly to the right and forward while intermittently panning left, then arcs counterclockwise before stopping at a wall. During the final movement, the camera angle shifts from level to high as it tilts downward. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire room in sharp detail. The man in the suit remains relatively stationary throughout the clip, while the man with the pistol appears to move slightly from left to right.",

    "Subject": "This video is presented from a first-person perspective, showing two men in a room. The primary character is a light-skinned, middle-aged man with dark brown hair, a full beard, and a mustache. He is dressed in a dark long coat over a vest and white shirt and is seen holding a dark pistol in his right hand. The second man, positioned in the middle ground, is a dark-skinned, middle-aged man with short black hair. He is wearing a formal dark suit, a light gray vest, a white shirt, a white bow tie, and black round sunglasses, and he stands with one hand on his chest.",
    "Motion": "From a first-person perspective, the camera captures a dimly lit room, with a hand holding a pistol visible in the foreground, and a man in a suit standing in the middle ground. The camera then reveals more of the room as the first-person character's body turns, sweeping past the man with a pistol to show a small table with a telephone, and the man in the suit remains relatively stationary throughout the clip, while the man with the pistol appears to move slightly from left to right.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, pans across a dimly lit room with dark green walls and a herringbone-patterned wood floor. The space is illuminated by a single wall sconce, revealing several framed portraits of men on the walls. Furnishings include a dark wood side table with a candlestick-style telephone, a single cream-colored chair, and a large, ornate blue-and-white vase in a corner. A wooden door with a brass handle is visible to the left. Two men in period clothing are present in the room, with the character in the foreground holding a pistol.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins from a first-person perspective, with the character holding a pistol occupying the right foreground. In the center middle ground, a second man is visible from head to toe. A large vase sits in the background, and a door is on the far left. The camera moves forward, pans left, and arcs, repositioning the second man into the left middle ground. This movement reveals a wooden side table with a telephone in the center middle ground and a chair in the bottom foreground. Framed portraits are visible in both the foreground and background."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
