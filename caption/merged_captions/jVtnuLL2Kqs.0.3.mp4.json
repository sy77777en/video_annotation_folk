  "merged_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot focused on Buckingham Palace, capturing a dramatic time-lapse cityscape scenery shot featuring the grand, neoclassical facade of the palace. Initially, the palace's facade is centered in the middle ground, stretching across the frame, with its ornate black wrought-iron fence and gold-colored gates positioned in the closer middle ground. The overcast sky, with heavy grey clouds that sweep rapidly across the frame, occupies the top portion of the frame in the background. The camera, positioned at a low, eye-level angle looking up at the building, maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. It smoothly trucks to the right while panning left to keep the palace centered, then stops and dollies backward at the end of the shot. This movement reveals more of the forecourt in the immediate foreground and widens the view of the palace. The time-lapse effect causes the clouds in the background to move rapidly across the sky, while blurred pedestrians move through the foreground, emphasizing the environment itself as the subject and highlighting the enduring presence of the landmark against the fleeting passage of time. As the camera pulls back, people are seen moving in the middle ground. The grand, light-colored stone facade of the palace, with its many windows and a central flagpole, dominates the scene. A static white logo overlay is visible in the bottom right corner of the screen.",

    "Camera": "This is a time-lapse video of Buckingham Palace, shot from a low, eye-level angle. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera smoothly trucks to the right while panning left to keep the palace centered, then stops and dollies backward at the end of the shot.",
    "Subject": "This video captures a dramatic time-lapse cityscape scenery shot featuring the grand, neoclassical facade of Buckingham Palace. The imposing stone building, complete with its ornate black and gold gates, stands firm under a sky of heavy, grey clouds that sweep rapidly across the frame. This is a scenery shot as the focus is not on any particular person or object, but rather on the monumental scale of the architecture and the moody, dynamic atmosphere created by the fast-moving sky. The time-lapse effect, which blurs the pedestrians into indistinct streaks of movement, further emphasizes the environment itself as the subject, highlighting the enduring presence of the landmark against the fleeting passage of time.",
    "Motion": "This video presents a dramatic, time-lapse view of Buckingham Palace in London. The camera moves across the iconic facade as clouds drift quickly across the overcast sky. The motion of pedestrians in the foreground is accelerated, creating a dynamic scene.",
    "Scene": "A time-lapse shot captures the exterior of Buckingham Palace in London under a dramatic, overcast sky with fast-moving grey clouds. The grand, light-colored stone facade of the palace, with its many windows and a central flagpole, dominates the scene. In the middle ground, an ornate black wrought-iron fence with gold-colored details and large gates encloses the property. In the foreground, a few people can be seen walking quickly across the forecourt. A white logo overlay is visible in the bottom right corner of the screen.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
