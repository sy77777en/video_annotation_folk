  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a person from behind, positioned on the right side of the frame in the foreground. The person has short, light-colored hair and is wearing a light-colored shirt. They are sitting at a wooden desk in a dimly lit room with a purple hue, using a computer with a white, robotic-looking prosthetic left hand resting on the keyboard. In the center of the frame, a large computer monitor displays a website titled \"TECHSALE,\" showing an order for computer components, including a \"Network Interface Card\" for \"US $45,\" with a \"Complete Order\" button. A red audio interface with black knobs is located in the bottom-left middle ground. The camera, capturing the scene with deep focus, smoothly pans left and tilts down, transitioning to a high-angle view of a cardboard box on the floor. The box fills the center of the frame and contains several computer parts, including a small, silver computer case with an orange front, a large, finned heat sink on top, and at least two other circuit boards. A person's foot, wearing a grey shoe and blue jeans, briefly appears on the top right corner of the frame, remaining stationary beside the box. The camera then briefly zooms in to focus on the computer parts inside the box, maintaining sharpness across all elements.",

    "Camera": "This eye-level shot begins with a level angle on a person at a computer. The camera smoothly pans left and tilts down, transitioning to a high-angle view of a cardboard box on the floor. It then briefly zooms in to focus on the computer parts inside the box. The entire scene is captured with a deep focus, keeping all elements sharp.",
    "Subject": "A person with short, light-colored hair is shown from behind, sitting at a wooden desk and using a computer. They are wearing a light-colored shirt and have a white, robotic-looking prosthetic left hand, which rests on the keyboard. On the computer monitor, a website named \"TECHSALE\" displays an order for computer components, including a \"Network Interface Card\" for \"US $45,\" with a \"Complete Order\" button at the bottom. To the left of the keyboard sits a small, rectangular, red audio interface with black knobs. The scene then transitions to a view looking down into a brown cardboard box on the floor, which contains several computer parts. Prominently visible are a small, silver computer case with an orange front and a large, finned heat sink on top, alongside at least two other circuit boards. A person's foot, wearing a grey shoe and blue jeans, is briefly seen next to the box.",
    "Motion": "A person sitting at a desk moves their hand on a computer mouse. The camera smoothly pans left and tilts down to reveal a top-down perspective of a cardboard box filled with computer components, with the person's foot remaining stationary beside it.",
    "Scene": "In a dimly lit room with a purple hue, a person with a prosthetic hand sits at a wooden desk. On the desk are a keyboard, a red audio interface, and a large computer monitor. An overlay on the screen displays a website titled \"TECHSALE,\" showing an order for computer components with a \"Complete Order\" button. The scene then shifts to a view inside an open cardboard box on the floor, which contains several computer parts, including two circuit boards and a silver, finned case with orange sides.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a person from behind, positioned on the right side of the frame in the foreground. In the center of the frame, a large computer monitor is displayed, while a red audio interface is located in the bottom-left middle ground, and a keyboard with a prosthetic hand on it is situated in the middle ground. The camera then pans left and tilts down to reveal a cardboard box that fills the center of the frame. Inside the box, various computer components are visible, and a person's foot briefly appears on the top right corner of the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
