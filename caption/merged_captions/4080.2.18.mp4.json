  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot, a Black woman with teal-colored dreadlocks, a septum piercing, and light-colored eyebrows is positioned in the left and center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. She wears a long-sleeved, olive-green top with embroidery, ripped blue jeans, multiple bracelets, and a necklace. The woman is seated in a softly lit outdoor setting with a blurry, natural background. In the right foreground, the dark, voluminous, curly hair of a second person partially obscures the view. The woman in the middle ground holds a lock of hair from the person in the foreground, twisting it between her fingers. She is wearing several rings, one of which is green. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level, capturing an eye-level, level-angle shot with a shallow depth of field, focusing on the woman in the midground. The camera performs a minor, smooth movement, simultaneously moving forward and to the right while panning slightly to the left. The spatial framing remains relatively unchanged as the woman continues to style the hair of the person in the foreground, who remains still.",

    "Subject": "A Black woman with teal-colored dreadlocks, a septum piercing, and light-colored eyebrows is shown from a front-side angle. She wears a long-sleeved, olive-green top with embroidery, ripped blue jeans, and multiple bracelets and a necklace. She is sitting and appears to be styling the hair of a person in the foreground, who is facing the camera and has dark, voluminous, curly hair. The woman holds a lock of their hair and is wearing several rings, one of which is green.",
    "Motion": "A woman with green-tipped dreadlocks sits and twists a lock of another person's hair between her fingers. The person whose hair is being styled remains still in the foreground.",
    "Scene": "In a softly lit outdoor setting with a blurry, natural background, a woman with green-tipped dreadlocks is seated. She wears a green, long-sleeved top, ripped blue jeans, several bracelets, and multiple rings, including one that is green. Her attention is directed toward a lock of hair from the person in the foreground, which she is holding in her hands. The dark, curly hair of this person is visible in the right foreground, partially obscuring the view.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
