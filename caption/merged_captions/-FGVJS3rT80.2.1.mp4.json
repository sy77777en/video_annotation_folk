  "merged_caption": "From a high-angle point-of-view shot with a varying Dutch angle, the curved, striped surface of a black and white booster stage with vertical stripes and a curved top occupies the foreground at the bottom of the frame. Initially, a silver upper rocket stage with a round shape and a circular opening at its top is positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground, attached to the booster with its engine firing a bright orange-yellow plume of light. The Earth is visible in the background, filling the lower portion of the frame below the rocket, with blue oceans and white clouds glowing under a bright atmospheric haze, while the blackness of space occupies the upper background. The second stage then separates and moves directly away from the camera, receding from the middle ground into the background. As it travels away, it becomes smaller within the frame, and its engine burn ceases, revealing the circular nozzle. The booster exhibits some shaking during the separation of the second stage but remains in the foreground throughout the shot. The camera, locked onto the bottom of the rocket in outer space, moves backward while rolling counterclockwise, with the Dutch angle varying due to this rolling motion. The shot maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field, and the movement is smooth with minimal shaking. Small particles are seen floating in the environment. The curved horizon of the Earth is visible below, covered in a pattern of white clouds over a blue surface, all glowing under a bright atmospheric haze. The upper stage becomes more distant as it travels further from the booster, and both objects are seen against the backdrop of Earth, with blue oceans and white clouds visible below.",

    "Camera": "From a high-angle, Dutch-angled perspective locked onto the bottom of a rocket in outer space, the camera moves backward while rolling counterclockwise. The Dutch angle varies due to this rolling motion. The shot maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field, and the movement is smooth with minimal shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video features a black and white booster stage with vertical stripes and a curved top, positioned in the foreground. A silver rocket with a round shape and a circular opening at its top separates from the booster, moving away into space. As the rocket detaches, bright flames and bursts of light are visible at its base. The rocket becomes more distant as it travels further from the booster, and both objects are seen against the backdrop of Earth, with blue oceans and white clouds visible below.",
    "Motion": "From a perspective on a striped booster stage, a silver upper rocket stage fires its engine, creating a bright burst of light. The upper stage then separates and moves directly away from the booster, receding into space against the backdrop of Earth's curvature.",
    "Scene": "From a locked-on POV shot mounted to a rocket, the view looks down towards the Earth, with the blackness of space positioned in the upper left corner. The curved horizon of the Earth is visible below, covered in a pattern of white clouds over a blue surface, all glowing under a bright atmospheric haze. In the foreground, the curved surface of the rocket stage, featuring a pattern of black and white vertical stripes, is visible. Initially, an upper stage with its engine firing a bright orange-yellow plume is attached. This cylindrical, metallic stage then separates and moves away from the camera, its engine nozzle becoming clearly visible as it recedes against the backdrop of the Earth and space. Small particles are seen floating in the environment.",
    "Spatial": "From a high-angle point-of-view shot with a varying Dutch angle, the curved, striped surface of a rocket booster occupies the foreground at the bottom of the frame. Initially, a second rocket stage is positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground, attached to the booster with its engine firing a bright plume of light. The Earth is visible in the background, filling the lower portion of the frame below the rocket, while the blackness of space occupies the upper background. The second stage then separates and moves directly away from the camera, receding from the middle ground into the background. As it travels away, it becomes smaller within the frame, and its engine burn ceases, revealing the circular nozzle. The booster exhibits some shaking during the separation of the second stage but remains in the foreground throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
