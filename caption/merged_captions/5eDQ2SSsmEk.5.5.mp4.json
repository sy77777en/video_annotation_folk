  "merged_caption": "This extreme wide shot frames a large, illuminated \"Off World Islands\" billboard on the left side, in the middle ground. A dark silhouette of a man stands in the center of the frame, also in the middle ground, on a wet, reflective surface. To the right, another illuminated billboard, \"Happy Pig,\" is positioned in the background. Towering skyscrapers fill the background, extending across the upper portion and sides of the frame. The foreground, at the bottom of the frame, depicts a dark, cluttered rooftop. The camera is positioned at ground level, employing a low angle to look up at the scene. It utilizes deep focus, ensuring a large depth of field where most elements are sharp. The camera moves forward very slowly and smoothly, with no noticeable shaking. The left billboard features a woman in a bikini, with the text \"OFF WORLD ISLANDS\" above her. Her head and gaze are subtly directed towards the left side of the frame, with her hands gently placed behind her head, slightly caressing her hair, while her body moves slightly. The right billboard displays a cartoonish pink pig wearing a chef's hat, with the text \"HAPPY PIG\" and \"0-24\" visible. The pig's right hand appears to be slightly waving a green object, then the pig disappears momentarily, and after the billboard flickers, it reappears from the bottom of the billboard back to its original position. The man is in the middle ground, positioned at the edge of the rooftop, facing the billboards. The scene is set in a sprawling, futuristic cityscape at night, characterized by towering, dark skyscrapers dotted with lights. A blue-tinged, hazy atmosphere, due to rain falling over the city, is illuminated by numerous light sources, including beams cutting through the air.",

    "Subject": "A large, illuminated rectangular billboard on the left prominently displays a medium-full body image of a woman with blonde hair and fair skin, wearing a white two-piece bikini. She poses with her hands clasped behind her head, looking slightly to her right, standing on a sandy beach with a palm tree to her left, under the large yellow text \"OFF WORLD ISLANDS.\" In the center of the scene, a dark silhouette of a man, seemingly wearing a jacket, stands facing away from the viewer. To the right, another large, illuminated billboard shows a cartoonish pink pig wearing a white chef's hat, with the text \"HAPPY PIG\" and \"0-24\" visible on a red and white background.",

    "Scene": "The scene is set in a sprawling, futuristic cityscape at night, characterized by towering, dark skyscrapers dotted with lights. A blue-tinged, hazy atmosphere, due to rain falling over the city, is illuminated by numerous light sources, including beams cutting through the air. In the middle ground, a lone, silhouetted figure stands on a wet, reflective surface. The foreground depicts a flattened rooftop of a building, seemingly cluttered with some items, although the dark surroundings make it difficult to discern what they are. Dominating the left side is a large, glowing blue digital billboard displaying an advertisement for \"OFF WORLD ISLANDS,\" featuring a woman in a white bikini and a palm tree. To the right, another, smaller digital billboard shows a red and white advertisement with a pig-like character and the text \"HAPPY PIG\" and \"0-24.\" The overall environment is dark, with the billboards and city lights providing the primary illumination.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
