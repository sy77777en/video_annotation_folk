  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot, a leopard is positioned slightly left of center in the foreground, looking toward the right of the frame. The leopard, with a yellowish-tan coat covered in a dense pattern of black rosettes and spots, has a white chest and underbelly that are also spotted. Its face features long, white whiskers, amber-colored eyes, and a pinkish nose, with its mouth slightly open, revealing its teeth and pink gums. The top edge of its right ear appears to have a small tear or notch. The background is composed of out-of-focus green and brown foliage that fills the entire frame, set in a sunlit, natural environment with dense foliage. The ground is composed of dry earth and scattered leaves. The camera remains static and is positioned at the leopard's level, using a shallow depth of field to keep the focus on the leopard in the foreground while blurring the background. The shot is slightly unsteady, capturing the leopard as it sits still, looking toward the right with its mouth slightly open.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
