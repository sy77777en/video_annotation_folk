  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot, using a first-person perspective to navigate the environment. The sequence begins with a high-angle shot looking down into the entrance of a red water slide, which is positioned in the center foreground of a white-tiled room. The camera, featuring mild barrel distortion, begins at eye level above the waist, positioned at a high angle looking down toward the entrance of the slide. The perspective then shifts dramatically as it plunges into the dark, enclosed tube of the slide, a tight, reddish-brown tunnel. The camera moves forward and downward, transitioning to a level angle as it follows the slide’s turns, with unsteady movement and noticeable shaking. A bright light appears in the center distance, creating depth as the camera travels toward it. The perspective emerges into a level, water-level wide shot of a long, flooded hallway. The murky water occupies the foreground, with colorful pool floats scattered across the surface from the midground to the background, including a yellow ring, a purple tube, and an orange animal shape. The hallway's white-tiled walls line the left and right sides of the frame, receding into the background. The view is now at water level, illuminated by bright lighting from windows above and a ceiling light in the room. The camera briefly bounces up and down above the water’s surface, adding a dynamic effect, and concludes at water level. The video lacks a main subject, instead using the first-person perspective to immerse the viewer in the strange and unsettling atmosphere of the environment itself.",

    "Camera": "The video features mild barrel distortion, causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward. The camera begins at eye level above the waist, positioned at a high angle looking down toward the entrance of a red slide. As the camera, representing the player's perspective, enters the slide, it moves forward and downward, transitioning to a level angle as it follows the slide’s turns. The camera uses deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping all elements sharp. Camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking, and after the player lands in the water, the camera briefly bounces up and down above the water’s surface, adding a dynamic effect, and concludes at water level.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a surreal indoor scenery shot, capturing a disorienting journey through a liminal space. The sequence begins in a sterile, green-lit room with white tiled walls, looking down the mouth of a vibrant red water slide. The perspective then plunges into the dark, enclosed tube of the slide, a tight, reddish-brown tunnel that opens toward a bright light. The camera emerges at water level into a long, narrow, flooded hallway, also lined with white tiles and small, high windows. The murky green water is populated by several colorful, abandoned-looking pool floats, including a yellow, purple, cyan, and two orange rings. The video lacks a main subject, instead using the first-person perspective to immerse the viewer in the strange and unsettling atmosphere of the environment itself.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a surreal, tiled indoor environment featuring a large red slide. The perspective then shifts dramatically as it plunges into the dark, enclosed tube of the slide, a tight, reddish-brown tunnel that opens up to a bright scene. This transition reveals floating colorful objects in a pool of water, illuminated by bright lighting from windows above and a ceiling light in the room.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, begins by looking down the entrance of a red, enclosed water slide situated in a room with white tiled walls and floors. The perspective travels down the dark red, tubular slide, emerging from the end into a body of water. The view is now at water level in a long, narrow, flooded hallway, also lined with white tiles, featuring a large ceiling light. Small windows are visible high up on the walls, and several colorful inflatable pool floats—including a yellow ring, a purple tube, and an orange animal shape—drift on the surface of the murky green water.",
    "Spatial": "This video presents a wide scenery shot, using a first-person perspective to navigate the environment. The sequence begins with a high-angle shot looking down into the entrance of a red water slide, which is positioned in the center foreground of a white-tiled room. The camera then moves forward and down, entering the slide, and the frame transitions to a tight shot from within the dark, red, tubular structure. A bright light appears in the center distance, creating depth as the camera travels toward it. The perspective emerges into a level, water-level wide shot of a long, flooded hallway. The murky water occupies the foreground, with colorful pool floats scattered across the surface from the midground to the background.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
