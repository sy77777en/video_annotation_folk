  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium full shot of the main subject, a man in a black suit with a white dress shirt, positioned slightly to the left of center in the foreground. He is captured mid-jump with arms raised, dominating the frame, and appears to be in his 30s with short dark hair and a focused expression. The camera is positioned at hip level and angled low, looking up, using a shallow depth of field to focus on the man. The scene is set in an elegant restaurant with large glass partitions, dark green curtains, wooden elements, and classical-style chandeliers. White tablecloths adorn the dining tables, and artificial lighting illuminates the interior. As the man jumps, a large mass of water forcefully breaks through a glass barrier on the left side of the frame, creating a dramatic splash and sending water spraying in all directions. The camera smoothly tilts up slightly, maintaining steadiness throughout. Three other men are in the midground; one in a light-colored jacket is centrally located behind the man in the suit, turning away from the action, while two other men are on the right side of the frame. One of these men is bent over a table, possibly reacting to the commotion, and another man in red is visible but not significant. Water rushes in from the top and lower left of the frame, obscuring most of the scene except for the main man in the suit. The scene shifts to a medium shot as the main subject continues his jump, moving closer to the camera, emphasizing the dynamic movement and sense of urgency. The video is in slow motion, capturing the chaos and disruption caused by the water pouring in. A watermark labeled \"MOVIECLIPS\" is visible in the bottom left corner.",

    "Motion": "A man in a black suit with a white dress shirt is seen running forward, jumping with his arms raised, appearing to be in a state of urgency or distress. Nearby, several other people are also present, seemingly trying to avoid danger. Behind them, a large mass of water is forcefully breaking through a glass barrier, creating a dramatic splash and sending water spraying in all directions. The background shows a room with wooden paneling and a chandelier, indicating an indoor setting, possibly a restaurant or a formal event. The water continues to pour in, causing significant disruption and chaos in the room.",
    "Scene": "The video depicts an indoor setting within an elegant restaurant featuring large glass partitions. The environment is characterized by classic decor, including dark green curtains, wooden elements, and classical-style chandeliers. White tablecloths adorn the dining tables. The scene captures a moment of dynamic motion as a person in formal attire jumps up, coinciding with a large amount of water rushing into the restaurant. The lighting is artificial, illuminating the interior. Overlay elements include a watermark in the bottom left corner, labeled \"MOVIECLIPS,\" which is not part of the scene.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium full shot of the main subject, a man in a black suit, positioned slightly to the left of center in the foreground. He is captured mid-jump with arms raised, dominating the frame. Three other men are in the midground; one in a light-colored jacket is centrally located behind the man in the suit, while two other men are on the right side of the frame. The left side of the scene features shattered glass partitions, and the right side has dark green curtains. Water rushes in from the top and lower left of the frame, obscuring most of the scene except for the main man in the suit. The scene shifts to a medium shot as the main subject continues his jump, moving closer to the camera. The transition from medium full to medium shot emphasizes the subject's movement towards the camera."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
