  "merged_caption": "This wide shot, filmed from a high angle above the subject, initially frames a stylized, humanoid character with a jack-o'-lantern head in the middle ground, positioned center-left next to a fenced garden plot on the right. The character, dressed in a long, hooded, purple-gray cloak, runs from the fenced garden plot toward the center of the screen, leaving a trail of pink, square-shaped particles. As the character walks towards the bottom left, the camera smoothly moves down and to the left to track the character, revealing a circular stone well with a wooden frame and bucket that moves to occupy the center of the frame. The character then approaches the well and stops beside it, ending in the center of the shot. The scene is set in a cartoon-styled outdoor garden area at dusk, illuminated by a warm glow from a lit lantern on a post. The grassy landscape contains several tilled garden plots enclosed by white picket fences, some of which are askew. Some plots have small green saplings, while another has seeds planted in neat rows. A central feature is the stone well surrounded by a circular brick pathway. Throughout the video, HUD elements remain static: a gold coin icon with the number 123 is at the bottom left, an inventory bar with icons of bags, a stick, and an orb is at the bottom center, and two vertical status bars, one blue and one yellow, are at the bottom right. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the entire scene, from the character to the surrounding fences and well, in sharp detail.",

    "Camera": "This video is captured from a high-angle, overhead perspective, tracking a cartoon character in a blue cloak. The camera smoothly moves down and to the left, following the character's path through the grassy area. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire scene, from the character to the surrounding fences and well, in sharp detail.",
    "Subject": "A stylized, humanoid character with an atypical appearance is present in a garden setting. The character has a round, orange head with carved oval black eyes and a carved smile, resembling a jack-o'-lantern. The circular mask on which these features are carved appears to be made of wood. It is dressed in a long, hooded, purple-gray cloak that conceals its torso and arms, from which thin, black, stick-like legs and feet protrude. The scene also contains a circular stone well with a wooden frame and a bucket, surrounded by a patterned brick path. Nearby are rectangular garden plots filled with tilled brown soil and enclosed by white picket fences, some of which are askew. Within one plot, small, green-leafed saplings are growing in rows.",

    "Scene": "A third-person 3D game video where the entire character is visible on screen shows a cartoon-styled outdoor garden area at dusk. The scene is illuminated by a warm glow from a lit lantern on a post. The grassy landscape contains several tilled garden plots enclosed by white picket fences; some plots have small green saplings, while another has seeds planted in neat rows. A central feature is a stone well with a wooden roof, surrounded by a circular brick pathway. A small, cloaked character with a round, orange-tinted face walks across the grass, leaving a trail of faint pink particles. In the bottom left corner, a HUD overlay displays a gold coin icon with the number 123. At the bottom center is an inventory bar with icons of bags, a stick, and an orb. On the bottom right, two vertical status bars, one blue and one yellow, are visible.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
