  "merged_caption": "The video begins with an extreme wide shot, featuring a gray pedestrian ramp at the bottom of the frame. In the bottom right corner, a gray metal mesh is visible, while train tracks appear in the bottom left. Centrally in the middle ground, a caged walkway angles upward. Behind the ramp, a tall, dark brown fence with a grid-like pattern stands in front of a concrete wall and white structures with louvered vents. The background reveals a multi-story beige apartment building with numerous windows and a smaller reddish-brown brick building. With a shaky, unsteady motion, the camera zooms in on the apartment buildings in the background. The shot is taken from a level angle and uses a deep focus, resulting in a large depth of field where most of the scene remains in focus. As the camera shakily zooms in, transitioning to a wide shot, a shirtless person wearing light-colored pants becomes visible behind the fence on a small rooftop terrace. The individual glides a short distance slightly from right to left while remaining near the center of the frame. The scene has a muted color palette and a grainy, film-like quality. As the shot continues to zoom in on the background buildings, the fence and the buildings come into closer view, though specific details of the person remain unclear due to the video quality.",

    "Subject": "The camera zooms in shakily on the apartment building in the background. As it approaches, a figure gradually becomes visible behind a reddish-brown fence.

    "Scene": "An outdoor, daytime scene is set in an urban environment. In the foreground, a metal mesh is visible in the lower right corner. In the middle ground, a gray metal pedestrian ramp with a caged walkway angles upward. Behind the ramp, a tall, dark brown fence with a grid-like pattern stands in front of a concrete wall and white structures featuring louvered vents. A multi-story, beige apartment building with numerous windows and a smaller, reddish-brown brick building are visible in the background. The shot slowly zooms in, bringing the fence and the buildings into closer view. The scene has a muted color palette and a grainy, film-like quality.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
