  "merged_caption": "In a close-up shot, a silhouetted young woman with long, dark hair tied back in a ponytail is positioned in the foreground, occupying the left and bottom of the frame as she lies in bed in a dimly lit bedroom at night. She is wearing a light-colored top, and her features are partially obscured by shadow. The woman holds a smartphone up in the middle ground, located in the top-center of the frame, with its illuminated screen visible, displaying a close-up image of her own face as she uses the camera app. The camera remains stationary but slightly unsteady, employing an extremely shallow depth of field that focuses on the person in the midground. In the background, a blurry shelf fills the right side of the composition, cluttered with numerous indistinct, colorful objects, while a single lamp emits a warm glow, serving as the primary light source. The woman's head shifts slightly to her left during the shot, and she then lowers the phone and turns her head to the side, away from the camera's perspective. At the end of the video, she begins to sit up from her lying position, with the camera remaining static and positioned at her level throughout the scene.",

    "Camera": "From a level, hip-level angle, the camera remains stationary but slightly unsteady. The shot employs an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the person in the midground.",
    "Subject": "In a dimly lit setting, a young woman with long, dark hair tied back in a ponytail is lying in bed, viewed from the side with some details visible. She is propped up and holds a smartphone in her left hand, looking at the screen. The phone's display is illuminated, showing a close-up image of her own face as she uses the camera app. The woman is wearing a light-colored top, and her features are partially obscured by shadow.",
    "Motion": "A woman lying in bed holds a phone up to her face. She then lowers the phone and turns her head to the side, away from the camera's perspective. At the end of the video, she begins to sit up from her lying position.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set in a dimly lit bedroom at night. A person, whose features are obscured in shadow, lies in bed while holding up a smartphone. The screen of the phone displays an open camera app, capturing subtle movements. In the softly blurred background, a single lamp emits a warm glow, serving as the primary light source and casting gentle illumination over a shelf cluttered with numerous indistinct, colorful objects.",
    "Spatial": "In a close-up shot, a silhouetted woman is positioned in the foreground, occupying the left and bottom of the frame as she lies down. She holds a smartphone up in the middle ground, located in the top-center of the frame, with its illuminated screen visible. In the background, a blurry shelf fills the right side of the composition. The woman's head shifts slightly to her left during the shot, but the camera remains static and positioned at her level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
