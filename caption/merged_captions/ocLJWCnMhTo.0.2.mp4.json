  "merged_caption": "The video begins with an unsteady camera capturing a ground-level, upside-down low-angle shot, showing the top side of a round, dark brown table and a person with light skin wearing a white t-shirt, seen from the upper body. A glowing red, ribbon-like object appears to float in midair, extending from this person toward the bottom. The camera then cranes up in an arc, transitioning through a worm's-eye perspective to a hip-level low angle, revealing the underside of the table. In the middle ground, the first person is seen upside down on the left, while a second person, a man with dark skin wearing a white t-shirt and light-colored pants, is partially visible in the foreground on the right. A metal pole runs vertically through the center of the scene, and two framed pictures are visible in the background on the right wall. The table in the foreground then moves toward the bottom left, revealing the second person almost fully in the center-right middle ground. As this happens, the first person becomes mostly obscured, with only their hands remaining in view at the top left. A burst of flame, a visual effect, then appears in the center of the frame, in the middle ground, in front of the second person, who stands with his hands raised. The scene is set in an indoor room with light-colored, textured walls, a light green ceiling, and a black and white dotted floor. The entire video has a grainy, low-fidelity appearance and is bordered by a dark vignette overlay. Throughout the camera movement, a deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp.",

    "Camera": "This video is captured with an unsteady camera that begins at a ground-level, upside-down low angle, looking up at a person and the underside of a table. The camera then cranes up in an arc, transitioning through a worm's-eye perspective to a hip-level low angle. Throughout this movement, a deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "The video starts with an upside-down low-angle perspective, transitioning to a standard low-angle view. Two people are visible: a person with light skin wearing a white t-shirt, seen from the upper body, with a long, glowing red object appearing as a visual effect suspended in mid-air. As the view changes, a man with dark skin, wearing a white t-shirt and light-colored pants, becomes the primary focus. He stands with his hands raised as an orange burst of flame, also a visual effect, appears in front of him. At this point, only the hands of the first person remain visible.",

    "Scene": "The video begins with an upside-down low-angle perspective, transitioning to a standard low-angle view. The scene is set in an indoor room with light-colored, textured walls, a light green ceiling, and a black and white dotted floor. A metal pole extends from the floor to the ceiling at the center of the view. Two framed pictures are visible on the wall. A bright red, ribbon-like visual effect appears suspended in midair, followed by a burst of fire erupting in the middle of the room. The underside of a round, dark brown table is also visible.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
