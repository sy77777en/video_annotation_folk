  "merged_caption": "In a close-up shot, a young, light-skinned man with short brown hair and a short beard stands in the right foreground, wearing a maroon t-shirt with the white text \"THE LEGENDARY\" and a red baseball cap backward. He initially throws a rectangular, light-brown graham cracker before becoming stationary and in focus, looking directly at the camera with a serious expression. The scene takes place outdoors during the day, with a large, textured tree trunk and green foliage forming the background. In the middle ground, a middle-aged, light-skinned man in a white t-shirt, who is out of focus, throws a red-backed playing card from the left side of the frame with precision. The card travels swiftly through the middle ground toward the right, slicing the graham cracker in half and causing it to shatter into small pieces. The resulting fragments scatter as the card continues its trajectory. The man in the middleground has a concentrated expression with his mouth slightly open. The video is shot with a static camera positioned at eye level with a level angle, using a shallow depth of field to keep the man in the foreground in sharp focus while the second man and the background are blurred. The playback speed is altered with a speed ramp effect, shifting between fast and slow motion, enhancing the dramatic effect of the card's flight and the cracker's shattering.",

    "Scene": "The scene takes place outdoors during the day, with a large, textured tree trunk and green foliage forming the background. A rectangular graham cracker is thrown by a man wearing a red baseball cap and a maroon t-shirt with white lettering. After throwing the cracker, the first man stands still in the foreground. A red-backed playing card, thrown by a second man, travels from the background towards the foreground and strikes the cracker, causing it to shatter into fragments.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
