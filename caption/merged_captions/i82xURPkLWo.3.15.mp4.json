  "merged_caption": "The video features a medium shot of two men seated in a rustic room with large windows. The older man, positioned on the left side of the frame in the middle ground, sits on a brown leather couch, wearing a light blue shirt. He initially turns his head slightly to his right to face another man in a dark brown shirt seated in a black chair, seen from behind in the bottom center of the foreground. The bald man then turns his head to his left, gazing out the window, while the other man remains seated, facing forward. Both are situated at eye level with the camera, which remains static, capturing the subjects and the room's elements consistently without any changes in shot size or position. The camera height is at the subjects' level, maintaining a direct perspective on their interaction. The room's large windows dominate the background, offering a view of an expansive landscape with golden fields stretching to the horizon under a clear sky, suggesting daytime, and a tree directly outside. Various objects, including a lamp, books, and potted plants, are scattered throughout the middle ground, primarily on the left and right sides of the frame. The interior includes worn wooden walls and a mix of vintage and eclectic furniture, such as leather chairs and a wooden desk, adding to the cozy atmosphere. The setting suggests a casual, conversational atmosphere, with the expansive outdoor view contrasting the intimate, lived-in feel of the room. The video, with a static camera positioned at eye level and a level angle, effectively uses deep focus to capture and highlight the intricate details of the room, blending natural and man-made elements.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
