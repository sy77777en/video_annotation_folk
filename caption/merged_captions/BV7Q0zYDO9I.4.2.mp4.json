  "merged_caption": "This video is captured from a high-angle, extreme wide shot, providing an aerial view of an industrial-style complex. A convoy of identical white trucks with black front and rear sections moves in two lines from a large, arched-roof hangar in the top-left middle ground towards a four-way intersection in the center-bottom of the frame. The trucks drive forward in unison, maintaining a steady flow, with only one lead truck entering the intersection. The camera steadily moves upward and backward while simultaneously rolling counter-clockwise, revealing a wider view of the intersection and the convoy of trucks. To the right of the convoy's path, in the top-center middle ground, are two industrial buildings: one with a weathered, flat roof and another with a brown roof and vents. A small, fortified guard tower is positioned in the middle ground at the center-bottom-right corner of the central intersection. The road network forms a cross, with one road extending from the top-center-left to the bottom-center-right, and another road extending across the frame from bottom-left to top-right. The asphalt roads are lined with yellow and white markings and flanked by sidewalks with streetlights. Low concrete barriers line the roads, and an overlay with white text appears at the bottom-left of the screen, reading, '[39]'.",

    "Camera": "From a high angle, aerial level, the camera captures the scene in deep focus. The camera steadily moves upward and backward while simultaneously rolling counter-clockwise, revealing a wider view of the intersection and the convoy of trucks.",
    "Subject": "An aerial view shows a convoy of identical white trucks with black front and rear sections emerging from a large, arched-roof hangar. The trucks proceed in two lines along a two-lane road toward a four-way intersection marked with white crosswalks. The scene is set in an industrial area with several grey, utilitarian buildings, including a rectangular structure with a weathered, flat roof and another rectangular structure with a brown roof and vents. A small, fortified guard tower stands near one corner of the intersection. The asphalt roads are lined with yellow and white markings and flanked by sidewalks with streetlights.",
    "Motion": "From an aerial perspective, a convoy of white trucks emerges from a large hangar, forming two parallel lines on a two-lane road. The trucks drive forward in unison, approaching a four-way intersection. Only one lead truck enters the intersection, and the convoy continues moving, maintaining a steady flow.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone provides an aerial view of an industrial-style complex. The scene features several large, simple buildings with weathered roofs set against gray, textured ground. A network of dark asphalt roads, marked with yellow and white lines, forms a central-bottom four-way intersection. A long convoy of white trucks with black cabs proceeds in two parallel lines, emerging from a large, hangar-like building and moving toward the intersection. Low concrete barriers and streetlights line the roads, and a small, tower-like structure stands near one corner. An overlay with white text appears at the bottom-left of the screen, reading, '[39]'.",
    "Spatial": "This video is captured from a high-angle, extreme wide shot.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
