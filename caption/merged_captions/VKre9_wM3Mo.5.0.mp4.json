  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a shot of a translucent white humanoid figure kneeling in the foreground, positioned in the bottom left of the frame, its back with a red cross pattern facing away from the viewer. A gray, opaque toilet stall occupies the middle ground, in the center of the frame. Initially, only the bare feet of a second figure are visible in the center, within the middle ground, seen through the gap at the bottom of the stall door. The camera starts at eye-level with a high angle view, then moves forward and downward, maintaining a deep focus with a large depth of field. As the camera moves, the kneeling figure in the foreground becomes larger, and its upper body moves towards the bottom edge of the frame. Simultaneously, the toilet stall in the middle ground also appears to move closer and fills more of the frame. The upward tilt of the camera reveals more of the interior of the stall, showing the lower legs of the second figure and the lower portion of a white toilet, both remaining in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. The camera is initially positioned above the kneeling subject and then changes to be at the subject's level, looking slightly upwards towards the gap in the stall. The translucent white humanoid figure remains stationary in a kneeling position. The lower legs and feet of a second humanoid figure, also stationary, then become visible inside a toilet stall. The scene is set in a dark environment with a reflective gray floor. In front of the kneeling figure is a gray, translucent bathroom stall. The stall door is closed, but the bottom of the stall is open, revealing a white toilet and a pair of white feet standing inside.",

    "Camera": "The camera starts at eye-level with a high angle view, then moves forward, downward, and tilts up to a ground-level, low-angle perspective to film the inner room from below. The movement is smooth, and the camera maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field throughout.",
    "Subject": "A translucent white humanoid figure is depicted kneeling on a reflective surface, its face pressed to the ground, oriented towards a solid gray, opaque toilet stall. A distinct red cross pattern is visible on the back of this kneeling figure. The view then moves to reveal, through a gap at the bottom of the stall door, the bare, light-skinned lower legs and feet of a second humanoid figure, who appears to be seated on a white toilet, of which only the lower portion is visible.",
    "Motion": "The translucent white humanoid figure remains stationary in a kneeling position. The lower legs and feet of a second humanoid figure, also stationary, then become visible inside a toilet stall.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set in a dark environment with a reflective gray floor. In the foreground, a translucent, white, human-like figure is on its hands and knees, facing away from the viewer. A red cross-shaped overlay is visible on its upper back. In front of this figure is a gray, translucent bathroom stall. The stall door is closed, but the bottom of the stall is open, revealing a white toilet and a pair of white feet standing inside. The camera moves forward and downward towards the stall.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
