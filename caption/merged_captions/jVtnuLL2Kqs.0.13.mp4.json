  "merged_caption": "This is an extreme wide shot of the scenery featuring the London Eye, a massive white Ferris wheel, set against a sky filled with heavy, grey and white clouds. The River Thames occupies the bottom of the frame, extending from the foreground to the middle ground, with barges positioned on both sides of the middle ground. The London Eye is the central element, located in the middle of the frame and rising from the middle ground. To its left, modern buildings are situated in the middle ground and background, while a long classical building stretches across the right side of the frame in the middle ground. The cloudy sky occupies the top two-thirds of the frame in the background, with a small airplane occasionally visible across the top center of the sky. The camera is positioned at a low angle, close to the water level, and the shot includes a smooth camera movement, combining a right pan with a leftward trucking motion. This is a time-lapse video, evident from the rapidly moving clouds, shot from a low-angle, above-water level. The camera maintains a deep focus on the London Eye and the surrounding cityscape. The scene includes movement such as rippling waters and shifting clouds, presenting a picturesque view of London. The video is presented in a widescreen format with black bars at the top and bottom, and a white logo overlay is situated in the bottom-right corner. The shot intentionally lacks a single main subject, as the wide composition and moody, desaturated color palette are used to convey the grand scale and somber atmosphere of the urban environment rather than focusing on a specific object.",

    "Subject": "This is a dramatic cityscape scenery shot featuring the London Eye, a massive white Ferris wheel, set against a sky filled with heavy, grey and white clouds. The wheel is positioned over the rippling waters of the River Thames, which occupies the foreground along with a large barge and extends to the middleground. In the middleground, older, classical-style buildings line the riverbank, while a mix of modern skyscrapers stretches from the middleground to the background, with a small airplane occasionally visible in the sky.

    "Motion": "This is a scenic shot of the London Eye on the River Thames. The camera smoothly trucks left and pans right, capturing the iconic landmark against a dramatic, cloudy sky with the city skyline in the background. The scene includes movement such as rippling waters and shifting clouds, presenting a picturesque view of London.",
    "Scene": "An outdoor scene captures the London Eye from across the River Thames on an overcast day. The large, white Ferris wheel stands centrally against a sky filled with dense, grey clouds, with a small airplane occasionally flying across the sky above it. The rippling water of the river fills the foreground and extends to the middle ground, where large barges are moored on both sides. Along the far bank, modern high-rise buildings are visible to the left of the wheel, while a long, classical-style building stretches to the right. The video is presented in a widescreen format with black bars at the top and bottom, and a white logo overlay is situated in the bottom-right corner.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
