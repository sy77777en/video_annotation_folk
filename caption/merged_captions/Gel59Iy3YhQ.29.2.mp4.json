  "merged_caption": "From a first-person perspective, the scene is framed with the character's arm occasionally visible in the bottom left foreground, looking into a small, curved pod. A circular hatch is located in the middleground, with a ladder positioned to its right in the center of the pod, also in the middleground, extending vertically through the frame. A curved console wraps around the left side of the pod, featuring a large screen above it displaying \"LAUNCH SEQUENCE ACTIVE\" and warning of entering a planetary atmosphere, instructing to \"Brace for impact.\" The camera starts at a high angle, panning left before panning right and tilting down to track a red fire extinguisher as it falls from the left, landing in the middleground near the ladder's base and sliding to the background near the opposite wall. The main lights suddenly turn off, and flashing red emergency lights activate, bathing the interior in red. The camera tilts up to follow a wall panel as smoke begins to fill the pod, obscuring the background on the left side, while sparks erupt from a panel in the background in that left side area. A red rectangular panel detaches from the wall in the background and falls into the right side of the pod, in the place between middleground and background, landing near a seat. The camera keeps panning and tilting until it finally tilts down, following the panel as it crashes to the ground. The scene's lighting shifts from white to flashing red, and the camera's view shakes more violently, simulating the impact. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire chaotic scene sharp as the environment rapidly deteriorates.",

    "Camera": "From an unsteady, eye-level, first-person perspective, the camera starts at a high angle. After initially panning left, the camera then pans right and tilts down to track a fire extinguisher as it falls to the floor. The camera then tilts up to follow a wall panel that detaches and moves erratically amidst blinking lights and smoke. The camera keeps panning and tilting until it finally tilts down, following the panel as it crashes to the ground. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire chaotic scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "From a first-person perspective, a character wearing an orange and black suit is inside a small, circular, futuristic pod. The pod's interior is initially white after the lights turn on, with a black ladder located in the center of the pod and a circular hatch on the floor. A large screen displays a \"LAUNCH SEQUENCE ACTIVE\" warning in red text. A red fire extinguisher falls onto the floor. The environment abruptly changes as the main lights go out, replaced by flashing red emergency lights. Smoke fills the pod, sparks fly from a wall panel, and a red rectangular panel detaches from the wall, falling to the floor as the situation deteriorates.",
    "Motion": "From a first-person perspective inside a futuristic pod, a red fire extinguisher falls from the left and lands on the floor. The main lights suddenly turn off, and flashing red emergency lights activate, bathing the interior in red. Smoke begins to fill the pod before sparks fly from a wall panel. A red rectangular panel then detaches from the wall and tumbles onto the floor.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures the chaotic interior of a small, futuristic spacecraft pod during a crash. The scene begins inside a curved, white-paneled cabin containing a black ladder, a circular floor hatch, and a console. Text on a wall screen displays \"LAUNCH SEQUENCE ACTIVE\" and warns of entering a planetary atmosphere, instructing to \"Brace for impact.\" The environment rapidly deteriorates as the lights flicker and turn to a flashing red emergency state. Smoke fills the small space, sparks erupt from a wall panel, and the entire pod shakes violently. A red panel detaches from the wall and clatters to the floor near a pilot's seat. A red fire extinguisher falls onto the floor from the left at first.",
    "Spatial": "From a first-person perspective, the scene is framed with the character's arm occasionally visible in the bottom left foreground, looking into a small, curved pod. A circular hatch is located in the middleground, with a ladder positioned to its right in the center of the pod, also in the middleground, extending vertically through the frame. A curved console wraps around the left side of the pod, featuring a large screen above it. A red fire extinguisher is dropped from the left, landing in the middleground near the ladder's base and sliding to the background near the opposite wall. The scene's lighting then shifts from white to flashing red, and the camera's view shakes more violently. Smoke fills the pod, obscuring the background on the left side of the pod, while sparks erupt from a panel in the background in that left side area. A red rectangular panel detaches from the wall in the background and falls into the right side of the pod, in the place between middleground and background, landing near a seat. The camera remains at the character's eye level throughout; its position is fixed, but its perspective becomes unstable, simulating the impact."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
