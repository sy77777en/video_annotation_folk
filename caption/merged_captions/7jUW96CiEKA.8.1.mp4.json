  "merged_caption": "This video uses a wide shot, capturing a white egret with long legs and a slender neck, positioned in the middle ground on the right side of the frame, crouched low amongst dense green grass on a bank next to a calm body of water. The water, greenish and reflective, occupies the foreground, middle ground, and extends into the background, filling the bottom and left portions of the frame. The grassy bank is in the middle ground on the right side. Initially, the egret is positioned with its head lowered, likely searching for food in the water. The camera is positioned above water at a level angle, focusing on the midground with a shallow depth of field, capturing the serene quality of the setting. The egret briefly flaps its wings and shakes its head before raising its head. It then turns its body and walks to the right, moving upward along the riverbank and away from the water’s edge, leaving the calm water and grassy area behind. The egret moves towards the top right of the frame and exits the shot, with its smooth, bright feathers contrasting against the surrounding greenery. The scene occurs during daylight hours, and the egret's presence is the focal point, highlighting its interaction with the natural environment.",

    "Subject": "The video features a white egret with long legs and a slender neck, standing on a patch of dense green grass by the edge of a calm body of water. Initially, the egret is positioned with its head lowered, likely searching for food in the water. After a moment, the egret turns around and leaves. Its smooth, bright feathers contrast with the surrounding greenery. The water reflects the scene, adding a serene quality to the setting.

    "Motion": "A white egret is seen standing on a patch of grass by the water's edge, with its head lowered as if searching for food. The egret flaps its wings and shakes its head before turning to walk to the right. It then moves upward to exit the frame, leaving the calm water and grassy area behind.",
    "Scene": "The video captures an outdoor scene at the edge of a calm body of water with greenish, reflective water. A bank covered in dense green grass and some taller, drier reeds runs along the water's edge. A white egret with a long yellow beak is positioned amongst the grass on the bank. Initially, the bird is crouched low, looking down towards the water as if searching for food. It then begins to turn its body and walks to the right, moving upward along the riverbank and away from the water’s edge, leaving the calm water and grassy area behind. The scene occurs during daylight hours.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
