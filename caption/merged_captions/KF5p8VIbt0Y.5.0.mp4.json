  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of a rural landscape, showing a wooden fence spanning the lower foreground of the frame, with farm buildings in the middle ground and a tornado in the background. Initially, no major subject is present, and the scenery fills the frame, with the buildings in the middle ground and the tornado in the background. As the shot progresses, a young woman with light skin and dark braided hair, wearing a light-colored dress with short sleeves and a fitted waist, enters from the right foreground, carrying a large rectangular suitcase in one hand and a smaller bag on her other arm. She walks slowly into view in front of the wooden fence, frequently lowering her head to look at the ground and taking unsteady steps. The camera is static, filmed from a hip-level angle, and employs a shallow depth of field, keeping the woman and the wooden fence in sharp focus while the background elements are more blurred. The video's darkness and low resolution make it difficult to accurately assess the focus type. The woman continues walking past the fence, transitioning from the right of the frame to the center-left foreground, gradually becoming the main subject. She remains in the foreground, with her full figure visible, while the fence stays in the lower foreground and the farm buildings remain in the middle ground with the tornado in the background. The camera maintains a level perspective as she moves across the frame, with no significant changes in camera angle or height. At the end of the shot, she turns her face to her right side, and her facial expression appears nervous. The overall color scheme is monochromatic, dominated by sepia tones, giving the scene a vintage appearance.",

    "Camera": "This is a static, slightly unsteady shot filmed from a hip-level angle. The camera employs a shallow depth of field, keeping the woman and the wooden fence in sharp focus while the background elements are more blurred. However, the video's darkness and low resolution make it difficult to accurately assess the focus type.",
    "Subject": "The video reveals a young woman with light skin and dark braided hair, wearing a light-colored dress with short sleeves and a fitted waist, carrying a large rectangular suitcase in one hand and a smaller bag on her other arm. She is shown walking and gradually coming into view, moving past a wooden fence. She frequently lowers her head to look at the ground, and her steps are unsteady. When she turns her face toward her right side at the end, her facial expression appears nervous. The scene emphasizes her emergence in front of the center of the fence, with her clothing and belongings clearly visible as she is revealed.",
    "Motion": "The young woman walks slowly into view in front of a wooden fence, carrying a large suitcase in one hand and a smaller bag on her other arm. As she moves forward, she frequently lowers her head to look at the ground and takes unsteady steps. She continues walking past the fence, transitioning from the right of the frame to the center-left, and then turns her face to her right side at the end of the shot.",
    "Scene": "The video depicts an outdoor rural setting with a wooden fence in the foreground, constructed from rough, weathered planks and posts, some of which are angled and uneven. Beyond the fence, several farm buildings with pitched roofs and simple wooden siding are visible, spaced across a flat expanse of land. The sky is dark and overcast, with heavy clouds and a visible tornado funnel extending from the clouds to the ground, creating a dramatic and tense atmosphere. The ground appears dry and textured, with patches of grass and dirt. A person carrying a bag and a suitcase enters from the right foreground, moving toward the center-left foreground. The overall color scheme is monochromatic, dominated by sepia tones, giving the scene a vintage appearance. There are no overlay elements such as text or icons present in the video.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a wide shot of a rural landscape, showing a wooden fence spanning the lower foreground of the frame, with farm buildings in the middle ground and a tornado in the background.

She remains in the foreground, with her full figure visible, while the fence stays in the lower foreground and the farm buildings remain in the middle ground with the tornado in the background. The camera is positioned at the subject’s height throughout, maintaining a level perspective as she moves across the frame. There are no significant changes in camera angle or height, and the spatial relationship between the subject, fence, and background elements remains consistent as the woman moves into view."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
