  "merged_caption": "This is a close-up shot featuring a woman with light skin and shoulder-length, pink-dyed hair with dark roots, positioned slightly left of center in the foreground. She is smiling and wearing a dark top that exposes her right shoulder. To her left, on the right side of the frame, a man with short black hair is partially visible, wearing a dark T-shirt. His right shoulder is shown, and at the beginning of the video, he briefly turns his head to the right, revealing half of his face. The background is indistinct and blurry, composed of a mix of soft colors and shapes, suggesting a decorated or painted interior wall. The overall lighting is gentle, creating a warm and slightly hazy atmosphere. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level throughout the clip but appears unsteady and shakes slightly. It uses a shallow depth of field to focus on the woman in the foreground and exhibits a slow backward movement, though it remains unsteady with noticeable shaking and no clear intentional movement. The woman with pink hair remains relatively still, holding a smile throughout the clip.",

    "Scene": "In a softly lit, close-up shot, a woman with light pink hair is seen smiling. The background is indistinct and blurry, composed of a mix of soft colors and shapes, suggesting a decorated or painted interior wall. To her left, on the right side of the frame, the shoulder and side of another person wearing a dark shirt are partially visible. At the beginning of the video, this individual briefly turns his head to the right, momentarily revealing half of his face. The overall lighting is gentle, creating a warm and slightly hazy atmosphere.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
