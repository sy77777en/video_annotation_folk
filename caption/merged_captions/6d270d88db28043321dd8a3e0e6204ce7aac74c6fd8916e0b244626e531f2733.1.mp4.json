  "merged_caption": "This extreme wide shot presents a landscape from a high-angle aerial perspective. A large body of water dominates the frame, extending from the foreground through the middle ground. Positioned in the bottom right foreground is a peninsula where numerous long, narrow, dark-colored boats are gathered near a small, simple structure with a brown roof. Several small, tan-colored landmasses are visible as islands within the water in the middle ground, primarily towards the left and center. In the upper middle part of the frame, there is an oasis or plain in the distance, and beyond that is the horizon. Flat terrain stretches across the background at the top of the frame, below the sky which occupies the upper portion. The sky is cloudy with soft pink and purple tones, indicating either dawn or dusk. The drone camera, maintaining a slightly elevated angle, smoothly moves left across the landscape, ensuring the entire scene, including the lake, islands, and distant shore, remains sharp. As the camera moves, the perspective slightly shifts, providing a broader view of the landscape, including more details of the islands and the docked boats. The setting is outdoors, featuring low water levels that reveal several small landmasses and islands protruding from the greenish-brown water. The background features a vast, green landmass that stretches out to the horizon, under a sky with a soft, pastel-colored hue. The shot lacks a single main subject because its purpose is to convey the vastness and atmosphere of the environment; the focus is distributed across the expansive water body, the distant flat terrain, the arrangement of the boats, and the quality of light, emphasizing the overall scale and tranquil mood rather than highlighting any particular object or individual.",

    "Camera": "From an aerial perspective and maintaining a slightly elevated angle, the camera smoothly moves left across the landscape. Deep focus ensures the entire scene, including the lake, islands, and distant shore, remains sharp.",
    "Subject": "This video features a landscape scenery shot, depicting a wide expanse of calm water, likely a lake or reservoir, dotted with small, exposed landmasses and islands under a soft, hazy sky tinged with pink and grey clouds. In the distance, a large, flat oasis and a faint horizon line add depth to the scene. Numerous long, narrow boats are clustered along a spit of land jutting into the water, near a small, simple structure.

    "Motion": "The video begins with an aerial view of a large body of water, with several small islands scattered across the surface. A small peninsula extends into the water, where numerous boats are docked along the shore. The background features a vast, green landmass that stretches out to the horizon, under a sky with a soft, pastel-colored hue. As the camera moves, the perspective slightly shifts, providing a broader view of the landscape, including more details of the islands and the docked boats.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures an expansive aerial view of a large, calm body of water under a cloudy sky with soft pink and purple tones, indicating either dawn or dusk. The setting is outdoors, featuring low water levels that reveal several small, tan-colored landmasses and islands protruding from the greenish-brown water. In the lower right, numerous long, narrow, dark-colored boats are gathered along the shore of a peninsula, near a small, simple structure with a brown roof. The surrounding terrain is predominantly flat, resembling an oasis or plain, and stretches towards a faint horizon line in the distance.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
