  "merged_caption": "The video presents a medium close-up shot, initially focusing on a man with a medium build and a mustache, positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground. He has a focused expression, wearing a dark outfit, possibly black, with long black hair neatly combed back. The setting is indoors, in a dimly lit room with stone walls, creating a somber atmosphere characterized by muted colors, primarily grays. Behind him, in the background, another out-of-focus figure is visible. The camera, positioned at eye level with a level angle, employs a shallow depth of field focused on the man. As the camera smoothly pans slightly to the left to track the subject, it briefly passes by a structural support pole positioned in the foreground. The man walks to the left with his head turned towards the camera, maintaining a steady gaze, either directly at the camera or possibly at something located behind it. As he progresses through the indoor setting, several other individuals in the background, dressed in traditional attire in either gray or yellow, are moving. These secondary subjects are less prominent and appear to be observing the main subject, adding context to the scene. The main subject shifts slightly towards the left side of the frame while remaining the central focus, and a black, blurred pillar occasionally appears in the foreground. The lighting is soft, casting subtle shadows that enhance the room's depth. The main subject's posture and attire suggest a setting of significance or formality, with the background changing slightly as the camera follows his movement.",

    "Camera": "The video features a camera at eye level with a level angle, employing a shallow depth of field focused on the man in the middle ground. As the camera smoothly pans left to track the subject, it briefly passes by a structural support pole positioned in the foreground.",
    "Subject": "The video features a man with a medium build and a mustache, who appears to be the main subject. He has a focused expression and is wearing a dark outfit, which might be perceived as black. His long black hair is neatly combed back. In the background, there are several men, some dressed in light gray robes and others in yellow robes with black trim. These secondary subjects are less prominent and appear to be observing the main subject, adding context to the scene. The main subject's posture and attire suggest a setting of significance or formality.",
    "Motion": "The man, dressed in a dark outfit, walks to the left with his head turned towards the camera. He maintains a steady gaze, either directly at the camera or possibly at something located behind it, as he progresses through the indoor setting with stone walls and decorative elements.",
    "Scene": "The video is set indoors, featuring a dimly lit room with stone walls, creating a somber atmosphere. The environment is characterized by muted colors, primarily grays, with a shallow focus that emphasizes the man in the middle ground. The lighting is soft, casting subtle shadows that enhance the room's depth. One main individual is centrally positioned, wearing very dark traditional attire. Several other individuals are in the background, dressed in traditional attire in either gray or yellow, and they are moving. The scene is dynamic, with the camera following the main subject as he moves, and the background changing slightly.",
    "Spatial": "The video presents a medium close-up shot, initially focusing on a man positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground. Behind him, in the background, another out-of-focus figure is visible. The camera then pans slightly to the left, revealing several other individuals in the background, dressed in traditional attire in either gray or yellow, and they are moving. As the main subject shifts slightly towards the left side of the frame while remaining the central focus, a black, blurred pillar occasionally appears in the foreground. The camera is positioned level with the main subject's height."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
