  "merged_caption": "A close-up shot centers on the upper portion of an older man's face, which occupies the center of the frame in the foreground against a blurred, indistinct background. The scene is set within a dimly lit interior, characterized by a muted color palette of warm tones. The man, who has graying, thinning hair and wrinkles on his forehead, wears glasses with dark, slightly translucent plastic frames. He is wearing a dark, possibly green, collared shirt. Initially, his head is angled downward, and he is looking down intently. The camera remains static throughout the shot, using an extremely shallow depth of field to focus on the elderly man in the foreground. Warm, low-key lighting illuminates his wrinkled forehead, while the background is a dim beige color. The man briefly lifts his gaze, moving his head slightly just enough to peer over the top of his glasses, his eyes peering over the rims, before returning his gaze to its original downward position.",

    "Camera": "This is a static, eye-level shot with a level angle. The camera uses an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the elderly man in the foreground.",
    "Subject": "A close-up shot features an older, fair-skinned man with graying, thinning hair and wrinkles on his forehead. He wears glasses with dark, slightly translucent plastic frames and is looking down intently. He briefly glances up, his eyes peering over the top of his glasses, before returning his gaze downward. He is wearing a dark, possibly green, collared shirt.",
    "Motion": "An older man, initially looking down with his head still, glances up and moves his head slightly just enough to peer over the top of his glasses. After a brief moment, he lowers his head again, returning his gaze to its original downward position.",
    "Scene": "A close-up shot is set within a dimly lit interior, focusing on the upper portion of an older man's face. He has graying hair and wears dark, rectangular-framed glasses. Warm, low-key lighting illuminates his wrinkled forehead, while the background is a dim beige color, heavily blurred and indistinct. The man, with his head angled downward, briefly glances up over the rims of his glasses before returning his gaze to something below. The scene is characterized by a muted color palette of warm tones.",
    "Spatial": "A close-up shot centers on the upper portion of an older man's face, which occupies the center of the frame in the foreground against a blurred, indistinct background. Initially, his head is angled downward, but he briefly lifts his gaze to look up over the rims of his glasses before returning to his original downward-looking position. The camera remains static throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
