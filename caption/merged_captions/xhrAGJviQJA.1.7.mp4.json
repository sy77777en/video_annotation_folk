  "merged_caption": "A medium shot, filmed from a low, subject-level angle in a selfie point-of-view, frames an East Asian man with short, dark hair and a broad smile wearing a white t-shirt, positioned in the bottom center of the frame in the foreground. He is carrying a young East Asian girl with dark, shoulder-length hair with bangs, dressed in a light-colored sleeveless top and black trousers, on his shoulders. The girl is located in the center of the frame, also in the foreground, with her arms outstretched as she smiles joyfully and looks upward. The man walks forward while carrying the girl, and as he moves, the girl raises her arms outward and upward, extending them as she looks up. Both maintain their positions, with the girl continuing to hold her arms outstretched as they move together. In the middle ground, colorful fabric banners in shades of red, pink, yellow, white, and purple hang overhead, filling the upper portion of the frame from left to right, fluttering in the wind against a blue sky with a few white clouds visible in the background between the banners. The camera, held by the person being filmed, smoothly tracks the man carrying the girl on his shoulders, moving backward and to the left. A deep focus with a large depth of field keeps both the subjects and the colorful flags above them sharp, capturing the outdoor scene on a sunny day.",

    "Scene": "A selfie POV shot, where the camera is held by the person being filmed, captures an outdoor scene on a sunny day. Overhead, long, colorful fabric banners in shades of red, pink, yellow, white, and purple are strung in rows, fluttering in the wind against a blue sky with a few white clouds. A man is visible from the chest up, looking straight ahead, while a young girl sits on his shoulders with her arms outstretched towards the sky, looking upward.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
