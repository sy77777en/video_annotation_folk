  "merged_caption": "A locked-on point-of-view shot is framed from the rear of a racing car, with the car's body occupying the bottom foreground and a large, centered rear wing in the middle of the frame. The asphalt road begins at the bottom quarter of the frame and recedes into the background, converging toward the center. On the left and right, the arid desert landscape stretches from the middle ground into the background. While the car's rear remains static relative to the camera, the road and surrounding desert appear to rush rapidly away from the middle ground towards the background, creating a strong sense of forward motion. The camera is positioned at the level of the car's rear, beneath a clear sky that fills the top half of the frame. The video is filmed from a camera mounted on the rear windshield of a car, providing a smooth, backward-facing point-of-view shot. The camera is positioned at a level-angle, eye-level and uses a deep focus, keeping the car's spoiler and the distant scenery sharp. The shot exhibits mild barrel distortion, causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward. As the car drives forward, the camera appears to move backward along the road, and it pans to the left while simultaneously trucking right when the car turns. The racing car accelerates forward along a paved track in a desert environment, then follows a gentle curve to the right, with its shadow initially visible on the side of the road before moving onto the road itself. The rear portion of the car features a large, black rear wing with bold, white, stylized letters, held by silver-colored, curved support struts. The car's body is adorned with a blue, bold, stylized font and a small, pink, cursive short sentence on the trunk area, just beneath the wing.",

    "Subject": "The video shows the rear portion of a silver and black racing car. A large, black rear wing dominates the view, featuring the letters in a bold, white, stylized font, although it is difficult to discern clearly due to the angle of the shot. The wing is held in place by two silver-colored, curved support struts. The car's body, visible below the wing, is adorned with a blue, bold, stylized font that is partially visible. A small, pink, cursive short sentence is present on the trunk area, just beneath the wing.",
    "Motion": "From a camera mounted on the rear, the racing car accelerates forward along a paved track in a desert environment. The car then follows a gentle curve to the right, with its shadow initially visible on the side of the road before moving onto the road itself.",
    "Scene": "A locked-on POV shot from a camera mounted on the rear of a car captures the vehicle as it speeds down a long asphalt road. The setting is a vast, arid desert under a clear blue sky, with a range of mountains visible on the horizon. The foreground emphasizes both the car's large, black rear spoiler and the rear portion of the car. The spoiler features white lettering and is supported by silver brackets. The car's body has a blue and black livery. A pink short sentence is positioned on the trunk below the spoiler. The desert terrain, characterized by sand and sparse vegetation, rushes by as the car moves forward.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
