  "merged_caption": "Initially, a person with short, bright pink hair, wearing black-rimmed glasses and a black face mask, is shown from the shoulders up in the bottom left foreground, near a red fire hydrant in the bottom left middle ground. A red sedan is in the left middle ground, partially behind the person, and a yellow street sign on a pole is also in the left middle ground. A paved street extends from the bottom right to the left, spanning from the middle ground to the background, with a park-like area containing trees and a low stone wall initially in the background. The video, shot at eye-level with a level angle, exhibits significant barrel distortion and maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera pans slightly unsteadily from right to left, and as it does, the person with pink hair, initially looking towards the lower left corner of the frame, begins to turn her head left. As the camera continues to pan left, some elements shift to the right side of the frame. A man with short, dark hair, dressed in black pants, a white shirt, and a khaki jacket, enters from the left, settling in the left middle ground. He initially faces the right side of the frame but starts to turn nearly halfway towards the left, with most of his body oriented towards the lower left corner. A tree with pink blossoms becomes visible in the left middle ground. The street then occupies the lower half of the frame, extending from the middle ground to the background, while the park area is in the right background, with streetlights and distant buildings in the far background. The scene is captured from an objective perspective, set outdoors at dusk or early evening under a light blue sky.",

    "Camera": "The video, shot at eye-level with a level angle, exhibits significant barrel distortion. It maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera pans slightly unsteadily from right to left.",
    "Subject": "The video first shows a person with short, bright pink hair, wearing black-rimmed glasses and a black face mask that covers their nose and mouth. This individual, with a light skin tone, is visible from the shoulders up, dressed in a black outfit with a brown jacket over it, and faces towards the camera. As the camera pans left, a man with short, dark hair comes into view. He is seen in full body, wearing black pants and a white shirt underneath a khaki jacket. He turns almost halfway, so most of his body faces the camera, but he is still slightly turned away.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a view of a street, where a red car is parked on the side and a red fire hydrant is in the foreground. The camera then pans left, focusing on a person with short, bright pink hair, wearing black-rimmed glasses and a black face mask, who initially looks towards the lower left corner of the frame. As the camera continues to pan left, her head also begins to turn left. Another person with short, dark hair, dressed in a white shirt and khaki jacket, comes into view. He initially faces the right side of the frame but starts to turn nearly halfway towards the left, with most of his body oriented towards the lower left corner. The background includes a park-like area with trees and a building, and the street is lined with street lamps and a yellow banner.",
    "Scene": "Captured from an objective perspective, the video shows an outdoor scene at dusk or early evening under a light blue sky. A paved street with white lane markings runs alongside a park-like area. On the sidewalk, a person with pink hair, wearing black glasses and a black face mask, stands near a red fire hydrant. A red sedan is parked at the curb. A yellow street sign is mounted on a dark pole. The adjacent green space features numerous trees, some bare-branched and others displaying light green spring foliage, and is bordered by a low stone wall. As the camera pans to the left, a lush tree adorned with pink blossoms comes into view on the left side of the frame. Streetlights are visible, and buildings are discernible in the distance.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
