  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a light-colored sedan, showing the rear and part of the side of the car occupying the right and center portions of the frame in the foreground, with its red taillights and light bar clearly visible. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, capturing the car from a level angle. The environment is dark, with limited visibility except for the glow of the sedan's headlights and red taillights as it travels away from the viewer on a wet road at night. The road surface appears wet, reflecting the vehicle's lights, indicating ongoing rain. In the background, a tall streetlight is also visible. As the video progresses, the camera smoothly pans right to follow the white sedan as it drives forward along the wet road, gradually moving away from the camera. The car becomes smaller in the distance as it travels further away, transitioning to an extreme wide shot. In this wider view, the car is positioned near the center and slightly to the right in the background, while the wet road extends from the lower left in the foreground to the middle right in the background. Open fields and distant trees fill the middle ground and background. The camera maintains the same level as the car throughout, using deep focus for a large depth of field, and the camera movement is steady and fluid. The sky is overcast, contributing to the subdued lighting and muted color palette. No other vehicles or pedestrians are visible, and the road appears empty and quiet. The primary spatial movement is the car gradually receding into the distance along the road, emphasizing its motion away from the viewer. There are no overlays, text, or additional visual elements present in the video.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, using deep focus for a large depth of field. The camera smoothly pans right to follow a white car as it drives away, causing the car to become smaller in the frame during the tracking shot. The camera movement is steady and fluid throughout.",
    "Subject": "A light-colored sedan is shown from the rear on a dark road at night. The car's red taillights and license plate are illuminated. The road surface appears wet, reflecting the vehicle's lights. In the background, a tall streetlight is also visible.",
    "Motion": "The white sedan drives forward along the wet road at night, gradually moving away from the camera. Its red tail lights remain illuminated as it continues down the road, and the car becomes smaller in the distance as it travels further away.",
    "Scene": "The video takes place outdoors at night along a rural road bordered by open fields and distant trees. The environment is dark, with limited visibility except for the glow of the white sedan's headlights and red taillights as it travels away from the viewer. The car’s lights cast reflections on the wet pavement, indicating ongoing rain. The sky is overcast, contributing to the subdued lighting and muted color palette. No other vehicles or pedestrians are visible, and the road appears empty and quiet. There are no overlays, text, or additional visual elements present in the video.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium shot of a white sedan, showing the rear and part of the side of the car occupying the right and center portions of the frame in the foreground, with its tail lights and light bar clearly visible. The camera is positioned at the same height as the car, capturing it from a level angle. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to an extreme wide shot, with the car moving away from the camera and becoming much smaller within the frame. In this wider view, the car is positioned near the center and slightly to the right in the background, while the wet road extends from the lower left in the foreground to the middle right in the background. Open fields and distant trees fill the middle ground and background. The camera maintains the same level as the car throughout, and no other vehicles or elements are present. The primary spatial movement is the car gradually receding into the distance along the road, emphasizing its motion away from the viewer."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
