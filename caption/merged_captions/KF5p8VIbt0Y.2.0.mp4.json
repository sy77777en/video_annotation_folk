  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot, centering on a man on the right and a woman on the left seated at a table in the foreground of a crowded, sepia-toned cafe from the early 20th century. The man has dark hair, a mustache, and wears a light-colored military uniform with a kepi-style hat, while the woman has dark, short, curly hair, a dark cloche hat, and a dark dress with a prominent white lace collar and a long necklace. They are holding hands. In the middle ground and background, other patrons are visible at various tables, with a \"CINZANO\" sign in the top left background. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, moves forward with a slight unsteadiness, passing between the first couple to reveal a second man and woman at a table in the middle ground. Here, a man in a military uniform argues with a woman in a dark dress and cloche hat, who then splashes a drink at him. The camera continues its forward movement, passing this second couple and transitioning to a full shot of a larger group of seven people at another table in the middle ground. The dolly continues, tightening the frame into a medium shot that centers on a man with dark hair in a military-style jacket from this group. He is surrounded by other men and women, including a woman with dark-colored hair and a pearl necklace to his right, the left side of the frame. The shot concludes with the man holding a coupe-style glass in the center foreground as a hand enters the frame from the top left to pour a beverage from a bottle into it, which the man examines closely.",

    "Camera": "From a hip-level angle, the camera moves forward with a slight unsteadiness through a crowded cafe, passing between tables of patrons. A deep focus with a large depth of field keeps the entire bustling scene in view.",
    "Subject": "The video features several people in what appears to be a crowded 1920s-era establishment. Initially, the focus is on a man and a woman sitting at a small, round table. The man has dark hair, a mustache, and wears a light-colored military uniform with a kepi-style hat. The woman across from him has dark, short, curly hair, a dark cloche hat, and a dark dress with a prominent white lace collar and a long necklace. They are holding hands. The scene then moves to a second couple at another table, where a man in a military uniform argues with a woman in a dark dress and cloche hat, who then splashes a drink at him. Finally, the view settles on a larger group at a table, centering on a man with dark hair in a military-style jacket. He is surrounded by other men and women, including a woman with dark-colored hair and a pearl necklace to his right, the left side of the frame. The scene ends with the central man holding up a coupe-style glass as a hand in white shirt cuffs pours a beverage from a bottle into it.",
    "Motion": "The camera moves forward through a crowded room, passing a man and a woman holding hands at a table. The camera continues past another table where a woman argues with a man and splashes a drink at him. The view then moves through the crowd to focus on a man at a different table who raises a coupe glass. A hand from off-screen pours a beverage from a bottle into the glass, which the man examines closely.",
    "Scene": "This sepia-toned video captures a bustling, crowded cafe from the early 20th century. The camera moves through the lively indoor setting, passing by numerous small, round wooden tables where patrons are seated. The room features architectural elements like columns and a large, decorated archway in the background, with a visible sign for \"CINZANO.\" People dressed in period attire, including military uniforms and flapper-style dresses, socialize, drink from coupe glasses, and interact intimately. The scene grows more crowded as the camera progresses, culminating in a moment where a beverage is poured from a bottle into a glass that a man is holding with one hand at a central table.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
