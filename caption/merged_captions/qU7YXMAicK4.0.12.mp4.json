  "merged_caption": "This full shot is captured from the pumpkin's level, with the camera remaining static throughout. A large, yellow-orange pumpkin is the central subject, positioned in the foreground and occupying the majority of the frame, slightly left of center. To the right of the pumpkin's stem, a dark green cap is situated in the center-right of the frame, also in the middle ground. Both objects rest on a brown wooden surface that fills the bottom portion of the frame. On the far left, a green vine extends from the pumpkin out of the frame. The background is composed of a white fabric wall. This is a time-lapse video filmed from a static, high, eye-level angle, looking down at an enormous pumpkin as it grows. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The video displays a fixed shot of a large pumpkin and a baseball cap on a wooden surface, with the pumpkin gradually increasing in size and the baseball cap shifting position slightly, moving further away from the pumpkin. Indoors, within a structure with white fabric walls, a massive, light-orange pumpkin rests on a surface made of brown wooden planks. The pumpkin is round with prominent vertical ribs. To the right of its stem rests a dark green baseball cap featuring a circular logo. On the left, a thick green vine extends from the pumpkin and continues out of the frame. The pumpkin has prominent vertical ridges along its surface. Next to the pumpkin's stem sits a dark green baseball cap with a circular orange and white logo on the front. The scene focuses on the gradual enlargement of the pumpkin.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
