  "merged_caption": "The video captures a wide shot of a nighttime urban street scene, showcasing the full breadth of the road and its surroundings. The camera, mounted on a vehicle's dashboard, provides a consistent view throughout, maintaining a level angle at eye level with deep focus and a large depth of field. The road stretches into the distance, lined with parked cars on both sides, extending from the foreground through the middle ground and into the background. A yellow car with red lights is prominently parked in the middle ground, slightly to the right of the center of the frame. Buildings with exterior lights are visible along the street, situated in the middle ground and background, flanking the road on either side. Streetlights illuminate the scene, casting light across the road and sidewalks. The vehicle moves smoothly forward, with the hood of the driving vehicle visible at the bottom of the frame in the foreground, reflecting the lights. The camera movement is slightly unsteady, with some shaking, as it progresses down the street. The street is relatively full, with parked cars almost completely lining both sides of the road. The car approaches a yellow vehicle with its brake lights on, indicating it is slowing down or stopping. At a distant intersection, only one car can be seen moving from right to left. The overall atmosphere is calm, with the focus on the road ahead and the surrounding cityscape. The ambient lighting, street layout, and movement of vehicles offer an immersive experience, likely intended to convey the feel of driving through the city at night. The overall spatial composition remains largely unchanged, with the primary dynamic being the forward motion of the vehicle.",

    "Camera": "The video features a forward-moving camera at eye level, maintaining a level angle. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field, capturing the street scene clearly. The camera movement is slightly unsteady, with some shaking, as it progresses down the street.",
    "Subject": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere of a nighttime urban street, rather than a specific object. The shot captures the ambient lighting, street layout, and movement of vehicles, offering an immersive experience likely intended to convey the feel of driving through the city at night.",
    "Motion": "The video, captured from a dashcam perspective, shows a nighttime street scene with a car driving forward. Only a small portion of the car's front hood is visible, reflecting the lights. The street is lined with parked cars on both sides, illuminated by streetlights and the headlights of the moving car. The car continues to move forward, passing by various parked vehicles, including a white van on the left and several cars on the right. The street is relatively full, with parked cars almost completely lining both sides of the road. The car approaches a yellow vehicle with its brake lights on, indicating it is slowing down or stopping.",
    "Scene": "The video, captured from a dashcam mounted on a vehicle, shows a nighttime urban street scene. The road is lined with parked cars on both sides, and lights outside the buildings illuminate the street. Streetlights cast a dim glow, reflecting off the wet pavement, suggesting recent rain. A very noticeable taxi with bright red taillights is parked towards the middle-right side of the road. The vehicle moves smoothly along the road, and at a distant intersection, only one car can be seen moving from right to left. The overall atmosphere is calm, with the focus on the road ahead and the surrounding cityscape.",
    "Spatial": "The video captures a wide shot of a nighttime urban street scene, showcasing the full breadth of the road and its surroundings. The camera remains stationary relative to the vehicle, providing a consistent view throughout. The road stretches into the distance, with parked cars lining both sides, extending from the foreground through the middle ground and into the background. A yellow car with red lights is prominently parked in the middle ground, slightly to the right of the center of the frame. Buildings with exterior lights are visible along the street, situated in the middle ground and background, flanking the road on either side. Streetlights illuminate the scene, casting light across the road and sidewalks. As the video progresses, the vehicle advances along the road, with the hood of the driving vehicle visible at the bottom of the frame in the foreground. The camera maintains a height level with the vehicle's dashboard, offering a driver's perspective. The overall spatial composition remains largely unchanged, with the primary dynamic being the forward motion of the vehicle."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
