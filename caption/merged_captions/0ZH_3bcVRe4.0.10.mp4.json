  "merged_caption": "This medium shot centers on three men positioned in the middle ground within a kitchen environment characterized by stainless steel counters and tiled walls. The main subject, initially located on the left side of the frame, is a man wearing a silver jacket over a black t-shirt, dark pants, sunglasses, and headphones around his neck. He moves fluidly from the left to the right side of the two uniformed men—one in a black police uniform with a peaked cap and the other in a white security guard uniform with a black tie and cap—both holding silver revolvers aimed forward. The man in the silver jacket adjusts their arms, so the policeman points his gun to the left, while the security guard points his gun to the right. The background shows a chaotic scene with broken dishes and a sense of disarray, with numerous kitchen items, such as plates and cutlery, suspended motionless throughout the foreground, middle ground, and background. The camera uses a speed ramp effect, shifting between fast and slow motion, and smoothly arcs clockwise around the central figures, maintaining a deep focus with a large depth of field to keep the three men and the surrounding kitchen environment sharp. The overall scene has a cool, blue-grey metallic color tone due to the lighting and materials. The main subject teleports between the two motionless figures, actively interacting with them by manipulating their arms and aim. The camera remains stationary at the subjects' level, capturing the dynamic interaction within the central space against the backdrop of kitchen shelves and equipment.",

    "Camera": "The video uses a speed ramp effect, shifting between fast and slow motion. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, maintaining a deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping the three men and the surrounding kitchen environment sharp. The camera smoothly arcs clockwise around the central figures.",
    "Subject": "The video features three individuals in a room resembling a kitchen, surrounded by objects like knives, plates, and water droplets suspended in mid-air. Initially, the man on the far left is wearing a silver jacket over a black t-shirt, dark pants, sunglasses, and has headphones around his neck. He moves to the right side and eventually returns to the center of the frame. In the middle is a man in a dark police uniform, complete with a peaked cap, holding a silver revolver. On the right is a man in a security guard uniform, consisting of a white short-sleeved shirt, black tie, and black cap, also holding a silver revolver. In the end, the man in the silver jacket is actively interacting with the two uniformed men, manipulating their arms and aim.",
    "Motion": "In a kitchen setting with scattered dishes and utensils, a man in a silver jacket and sunglasses, wearing headphones, moves from the left to the right side of the two uniformed men—one in a black police uniform and the other in a white security guard uniform—and adjusts their arms holding the guns. Then, he teleports between the two motionless figures, adjusting their arms so that the man in the white shirt points his gun to the left, while the man in the black uniform points his gun to the right. The background shows a chaotic scene with broken dishes and a sense of disarray.",
    "Scene": "The video is set indoors within a kitchen environment, characterized by stainless steel counters and what appear to be tiled walls. Numerous metallic kitchen utensils, predominantly knives, are suspended in mid-air, alongside visible water droplets, creating the effect of arrested motion. Stacks of white cups and white plates are visible on the counters. The overall scene has a cool, blue-grey metallic color tone due to the lighting and materials. Three male figures are positioned centrally within this setting, with the man on the far left quickly moving from the left to the far right, then instantly appearing between the other two motionless individuals.",
    "Spatial": "This medium shot centers on three men positioned in the middle ground. The main subject is initially located on the left side of the frame, while the police officer and the security guard are positioned at the center and the right side of the frame, respectively. Both the policeman and the security guard are static, holding transparent revolvers aimed forward in the middle ground. Numerous kitchen items, such as plates and cutlery, are suspended motionless throughout the foreground, middle ground, and background. The main subject moves fluidly within the central space, interacting with the frozen figures by adjusting their arms so that the policeman points his gun to the left, while the security guard points his gun to the right. The background features kitchen shelves and equipment. The camera remains stationary at the subjects' level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
