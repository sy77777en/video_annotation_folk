  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot capturing the architectural scenery, focusing on the curving staircase that occupies the bottom center and left portions of the frame in the foreground, curving into the center midground. The circular tiled wall and large white pillars are positioned in the center and right, extending from the middle ground to the background. The metal handrail follows the curve of the stairs, running from the bottom right toward the center. As the video progresses, the camera angle shifts to follow the curve of the staircase as it descends, with the staircase now occupying the bottom left and center of the frame in the foreground, curving into the center midground. The tiled walls dominate the left foreground, as well as the center, right, and top center and top right background. The background is visible at the bottom right, right, and center of the frame. The camera maintains a height slightly above the stairs, angled downward to emphasize the descent and curvature of the space, with smooth tracking along the staircase’s path, consistently highlighting the architectural elements. This is a slightly unsteady, first-person POV shot from a high angle, eye-level perspective. The camera moves forward, descending a set of arcing stairs while making multiple slight pans to the left. The video features mild barrel distortion and maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The scene is bathed in a diffuse, slightly greenish light, creating a clean yet unsettling atmosphere. The video lacks a traditional main subject, as the focus is placed entirely on the liminal and surreal quality of the architecture itself, emphasizing the environment's scale and mood over any specific object or character. The overall atmosphere is clean and serene, with soft lighting and a monochromatic color palette.",

    "Subject": "This video presents an architectural scenery shot of a sterile, minimalist interior. A wide, curving staircase, covered entirely in small white tiles, descends into a circular space defined by large, plain white pillars and a matching tiled wall. A simple metal handrail follows the curve of the stairs, which lead down towards a pool of water.

    "Motion": "The video features a smooth, continuous shot of a modern, minimalist interior space. The scene showcases a white tiled spiral staircase with curved walls and columns, leading down to a lower level with dark water. The overall atmosphere is clean and serene, with soft lighting and a monochromatic color palette.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves through an indoor environment dominated by smooth, white tiled surfaces and curved architectural forms. The setting features a wide, spiraling staircase with a metal handrail, descending alongside tall, cylindrical columns and rounded walls. The tiles are small, square, and uniformly white, covering both the floor and walls, creating a clean, continuous appearance. The lighting is soft and diffuse, suggesting artificial illumination without visible light sources, and the overall color palette is monochromatic with subtle greenish undertones. There are no windows or visible decorations, and the space feels enclosed and expansive, with the staircase leading downward toward a darker area partially obscured by the curve of the wall. No overlays, text, or additional visual elements are present in the video.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
