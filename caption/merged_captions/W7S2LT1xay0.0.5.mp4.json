  "merged_caption": "A close-up shot centers on a young, light-skinned person with light-colored eyes and light brown hair, sitting in the driver's seat of a car at their eye level. They have a faint, thin mustache and are looking directly forward with a neutral expression. Their hair appears to be pulled back or is short. The scene is set inside a moving car at night, with the vehicle's interior dimly lit from within. The warm, brownish tones of a headrest are visible, and through the car windows, the background is a blur of motion, with out-of-focus streetlights and other light sources streaking past, creating bright, circular patterns against the darkness. The person remains stationary in the driver's seat, looking directly forward. The camera, fixed to the front of the vehicle and facing the driver, focuses on the person in the foreground using a shallow depth of field. It moves backward with the car, leading the subject from the front, and the movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking. As the shot progresses, the background lights streak horizontally, indicating motion, while the camera slightly zooms in on the person's face, causing them to fill more of the frame as the background becomes increasingly blurred. Midway through the shot, the camera zooms in further on the driver's face, causing them to become larger in the frame.",

    "Camera": "From an eye-level, straight-on angle, the camera focuses on the driver in the foreground using a shallow depth of field. Fixed to the front of the vehicle and facing the driver, the camera moves backward with the car, leading the subject from the front. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking. Midway through the shot, the camera zooms in on the driver's face, causing him to become larger in the frame.",
    "Subject": "A young, light-skinned person with light-colored eyes and light brown hair sits in the driver's seat of a car at night. They have a faint, thin mustache and are looking directly forward with a neutral expression. Their hair appears to be pulled back or is short. They are positioned in the center of the view, and the scene is dimly lit from within the car.",
    "Motion": "A person remains stationary in the driver's seat of a car, looking directly forward. The car is in motion, as indicated by the blurred lights of the nighttime environment streaking past the windows.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set inside a moving car at night. The vehicle's interior is dark, with the warm, brownish tones of a headrest visible. Through the car windows, the background is a blur of motion, with out-of-focus streetlights and other light sources streaking past, creating bright, circular patterns against the darkness. A person is seated in the driver's position, looking forward.",
    "Spatial": "A close-up shot centers on a person in the foreground, positioned in the driver's seat of a car at their eye level. In the background, out-of-focus lights are visible through the car windows. As the shot progresses, the background lights streak horizontally, indicating motion, while the camera slightly zooms in on the person's face, causing them to fill more of the frame as the background becomes increasingly blurred."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
