  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot of the Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute in Venice. The scene opens with a low-angle view, framing the large dome of the basilica in the upper-left and left side of the frame against a cloudy sky in the background. The camera starts at a low angle looking up at the basilica, then simultaneously tilts down and trucks to the left while rolling slightly clockwise. This movement reveals the full facade of the basilica, which occupies the left and center middle ground, and a wide staircase leading down from it. The grand, white stone church features an ornate facade with numerous statues, columns, and a large, dark arched door, all beneath a massive grey dome. In the bottom foreground, a canal and several dark blue gondolas moored to wooden poles come into view. A second, simpler building with a red-tiled roof is positioned in the middle ground on the right. The camera angle becomes more level relative to the base of the basilica, and the slow, continuous trucking motion to the left persists throughout the clip, maintaining a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. Small figures of people on the steps and in the vicinity highlight the monumental scale of the main structure. The perspective slowly trucks left, revealing more of the steps and the boats at the water's edge, where a few people are seen walking. The canal's murky green water contrasts with the light-colored stone of the basilica, enhancing the architectural grandeur and atmosphere of the Venetian setting under an overcast sky.",

    "Camera": "From an above-water perspective, the camera starts at a low angle looking up at the basilica. It then smoothly trucks to the left while tilting down and rolling slightly clockwise, transitioning to a more level angle. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "This video captures the architectural grandeur and atmosphere of a Venetian setting, focusing on a magnificent, domed basilica constructed from light-colored stone, adorned with statues and intricate carvings. The dome is a slightly darker gray compared to the rest of the building. A wide staircase leads up to a large, dark green central door, with a simpler building featuring a red-tiled roof visible to the right. In the foreground, a canal is visible, with dark gondolas moored in the water at the foot of the stairs. Small figures of people on the steps and in the vicinity highlight the monumental scale of the main structure under an overcast sky. Initially, the camera is angled upwards, focusing on the dome and sky, before tilting down to a level angle to reveal the canal and gondolas. The camera is slowly moving to the left, suggesting it is traveling along the canal.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenery shot of the Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute in Venice. The camera tilts down from a shot of the basilica's dome and ornate facade. This movement reveals the grand steps leading up from the canal and several gondolas moored in the foreground.",
    "Scene": "An outdoor scene from a canal in Venice captures the Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute under a cloudy sky. The grand, white stone church features an ornate facade with numerous statues, columns, and a large, dark arched door, all beneath a massive grey dome. A wide set of stone steps descends from the basilica's entrance to the edge of the murky green water. In the foreground, several dark blue gondolas are moored to wooden poles. To the right of the main church, a simpler building with a red-tiled roof is visible. The perspective slowly trucks left, revealing more of the steps and the boats at the water's edge, where a few people are seen walking.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
