  "merged_caption": "This is an extreme wide scenery shot with no main subject, captured from a low angle looking up at the sky. A snow-covered landscape occupies the bottom of the frame in the foreground. A dark silhouette of a dense coniferous treeline stretches horizontally across the middle ground, separating the snow from the sky. Most of the frame is filled by the sky in the background, which is illuminated by the vibrant green aurora borealis. Initially, the aurora appears as distinct bands, with one prominent band extending from the top left towards the center and another on the right. As the time-lapse progresses, these bands of light shift, expand, and morph, dancing and swirling across the dark, starry sky. The celestial lights undulate, shifting in shape and intensity, creating a mesmerizing display. The static, time-lapse shot is captured from a low-angle, eye-level perspective, with a deep focus keeping the snowy landscape, the treeline, and the faint stars in the sky sharp and clear. The time-lapse effect causes the aurora borealis to dance and shift rapidly across the night sky, highlighting the natural phenomenon and the vast landscape. The serene winter scene is dominated by the vibrant green aurora, which appears in broad, shifting bands and curtains that move across the sky, filling it with dynamic light. The only movement in this tranquil environment is the mesmerizing undulation of the aurora, set against the backdrop of a nocturnal, wintry landscape.",

    "Subject": "This is a landscape scenery shot of a vibrant green aurora borealis illuminating a nocturnal, wintry environment. The northern lights appear as broad, shifting curtains of light that fill the dark sky, with faint stars visible in the background. A dark silhouette of a dense coniferous treeline marks the horizon, separating the bright white, snow-covered ground from the dynamic sky. There is no main subject, highlighting the natural phenomenon and the vast landscape.",
    "Motion": "This stunning time-lapse video showcases the vibrant green Aurora Borealis over a snowy, tree-lined landscape. The celestial lights dance and swirl across the dark, starry sky, shifting in shape and intensity. The only movement in this serene winter scene is the mesmerizing undulation of the aurora.",
    "Scene": "In a nighttime outdoor scene, the sky is dominated by the vibrant green Aurora Borealis. The celestial light appears in broad, shifting bands and curtains that move across the dark, star-filled sky. Below, a vast, flat landscape is covered in white snow, bordered in the distance by the dark silhouette of a dense coniferous forest.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
