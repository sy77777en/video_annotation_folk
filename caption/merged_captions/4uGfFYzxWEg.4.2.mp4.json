  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of an old, dark grey CRT television, centrally positioned in the frame and occupying the foreground. On the television screen, various scenes from the game show \"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?\" are displayed. Initially, two fair-skinned men are shown; the one on the left, wearing a light blue button-down shirt, is positioned slightly left of the TV screen's center, and the one on the right, in a gray suit, is slightly to the right. The man in the gray suit places his arm around the other man's shoulder, both smiling and looking at the camera. The man in the gray suit gestures with his hand while speaking, and the man in the light blue shirt looks down. The scene transitions to a close-up of the man in the light blue shirt, identified as Adrian Pollock from Vale of Glamorgan, with the date December 23, 2000, displayed on the screen. Adrian waves his right hand towards the camera as the audience in the background applauds. The screen then shows the total prize money of £32,000, and Adrian faces the camera with his gaze directed towards the right side of the frame, showing a slight smile. Later, a woman with long, dark brown hair, fair skin, and wearing a red top appears on the left side of the TV screen, with a prize money ladder as an onscreen overlay on the right side. She initially looks towards the prize ladder graphic, blinks, and her gaze moves downward. As the camera cuts back to the woman, she looks down and covers her face with her right hand while a question about the author of 'The Hunting of the Snark' is displayed on the screen. The camera is at a level angle, zooming smoothly and slowly in on the television screen, causing the TV screen to increasingly fill the main frame. By the end, the TV screen dominates the view, leaving only a small border of the physical television visible at the edges, and the TV itself remains in the foreground.",

Initially, the TV screen shows two fair-skinned men on the show's set. The man on the left is balding with short, light-colored hair on the sides and is wearing a light blue button-down shirt with light-colored trousers. The man on the right has light-colored hair and wears a dark turtleneck under a gray suit jacket; he smiles and has his arm around the first man's shoulder. The focus on the TV screen then shifts to the first man, identified as Adrian Pollock, sitting alone and looking towards the camera, followed by a graphic displaying his winnings of £32,000. Later, the TV screen features a woman with long, dark brown hair, fair skin, and wearing a red top. She is shown looking seriously to the right of the frame next to the show's prize money ladder, which also highlights the £32,000 level. Subsequently, she appears looking down and covering her face with her right hand while a question is displayed on the screen below her.

    "Scene": "The video displays footage from the game show \"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?\" on an old, dark grey CRT television screen. The game show scenes take place in a studio with a dark, patterned backdrop and stage lighting. Initially, two men are seen on stage, one with his arm around the other. Following this, the video transitions to an interview segment on stage, with the audience visible in the background. Subsequent scenes feature a man with a receding hairline, identified by an on-screen graphic as \"ADRIAN POLLOCK,\" with overlays indicating the date \"December 23, 2000\" and \"TOTAL PRIZE MONEY £32,000.\" Later, a woman with dark hair appears, with a money ladder graphic on the right side of the screen highlighting £32,000. She is then shown looking down, covering her face, as a question overlay asks, \"Who wrote the nonsense poem 'The Hunting of the Snark'?\" with answer options \"A. G.K. Chesterton\" and \"B. Hilaire Belloc.\" An overlay in the bottom left corner of the television screen reads \"[5] ; ITV - Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? (2000)\".",

Initially, two men are shown; the one on the left is positioned slightly left of the TV screen's center, and the one on the right is slightly to the right. Subsequently, a man identified as Adrian Pollock appears centered on the TV screen, positioned in the foreground of the TV display, with text overlays for his name and prize money at the bottom center of the TV screen and a date at the top. Later, a woman is shown on the left side of the TV screen, in the foreground of the TV display, with a prize money ladder as an onscreen overlay on the right side. A question and answer options then appear as overlays at the bottom of the TV screen. A show title overlay remains consistently at the bottom left of the main video frame. As the video progresses, the camera continuously zooms in, causing the television screen to increasingly fill the main frame. By the end, the TV screen dominates the view, leaving only a small border of the physical television visible at the edges, and the TV itself remains in the foreground."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
