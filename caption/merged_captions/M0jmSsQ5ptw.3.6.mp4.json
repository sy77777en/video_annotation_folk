  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot of an outdoor scene, featuring a large, yellow, wooden lattice crane positioned in the right middle ground. The crane has a tall A-frame base and a long, rotating arm with a black trapezoidal prism counterweight hanging from it. A light-yellow toy biplane with two sets of wings, wheels, and red and blue markings on its tail hangs from the crane's arm in the center-left middle ground. A white cloth bag with the word \"MAIL\" printed on it in black is suspended between two smaller yellow wooden A-frame posts in the left middle ground. The background consists of an arid field, a wire fence, and distant hills and buildings visible on the horizon. As the crane's arm rotates to the left, the camera smoothly pans left and moves forward from an eye-level perspective, maintaining deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. The toy plane travels forward along a wire, rotating counterclockwise around the wooden structure. As it moves, a hook underneath the plane snags the white mailbag, lifting it from the separate, stationary line. The plane continues its forward trajectory, now carrying the mailbag with it, and eventually reaches the upper right corner of the frame. The camera maintains a position at the subject's level throughout the shot, capturing the dynamic motion of the plane and the crane's arm against the backdrop of a partly cloudy blue sky.",

    "Camera": "From an eye-level perspective, the camera smoothly pans left and moves forward, focusing on the rotating arm of a wooden crane. The shot utilizes a deep focus, keeping the entire scene from the foreground to the distant mountains sharp.",
    "Subject": "A large, yellow, wooden lattice crane stands on the right, featuring a tall A-frame base and a long, rotating arm from which a large, black, trapezoidal prism counterweight hangs. Suspended from the front of the crane's arm is a light-yellow toy biplane with two sets of wings, wheels, and red and blue markings on its tail. As the crane's arm rotates, the toy plane moves along a wire and uses a hook to catch a white cloth bag with the word \"MAIL\" printed on it in black. The bag is suspended on a separate line stretched between two smaller, yellow wooden A-frame posts.",
    "Motion": "The wooden crane's arm rotates to the left, causing the suspended toy biplane to travel forward along a wire. As the plane moves, a hook underneath it snags a white mailbag, lifting it from a separate, stationary line. The plane continues its forward trajectory, now carrying the mailbag with it.",
    "Scene": "An outdoor scene is set in a wide, arid field under a partly cloudy blue sky. A large, wooden, lattice-style crane stands on the right, featuring a black trapezoidal prism counterweight suspended by a chain. To the left, a series of wooden A-frame supports holds a taut wire. A small, tan model biplane is suspended from this wire, moving from right to left. A white bag with \"MAIL\" printed on it is attached to a separate line stretched between two smaller, yellow wooden A-frame posts. As the crane's arm rotates, the toy plane uses a hook to catch the mailbag. The background consists of a dry, grassy expanse with a wire fence, and distant hills and buildings are visible on the horizon.",
    "Spatial": "The video opens with a wide shot of an outdoor scene, featuring a large wooden crane positioned in the right middle ground. A toy biplane hangs from the crane's arm in the center-left middle ground, while a white mailbag is suspended between two smaller wooden posts in the left middle ground. The background is composed of an arid field and distant mountains. As the crane's arm rotates, the camera smoothly pans left and moves forward. The toy plane rotates counterclockwise around the wooden structure, traveling from the left center middle ground to the top of the frame, where it hooks the mailbag. It continues to rotate and eventually reaches the upper right corner of the frame. The camera maintains a position at the subject's level throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
