  "merged_caption": "The video is presented as an extreme wide shot, with a mountain biker initially positioned in the top left of the frame, in the middle ground on a steep, reddish-brown, rocky hillside in a desert canyon. A blue flag with a red bull logo is also located in the top left, in the middle ground. The arid terrain is dotted with sparse green bushes and shrubs. In the foreground, a crowd of spectators, composed of men and women in casual attire like t-shirts, shorts, and hats, occupies the bottom of the frame, with some holding up phones, appearing to film the event. The biker, wearing a yellow and black long-sleeved jersey, black pants, and a matching yellow and black full-face helmet, rides down the steep hillside along a narrow, dusty path. As the biker descends, they move diagonally from the top left, launching into the air off a dirt ramp. The camera, positioned below the subject, begins at a low angle, looking up at the biker, and transitions to a level angle as it follows their movement. It tilts down and pans right to track the biker's motion through the air, keeping the biker in the top left corner of the frame. The video is in slow motion, with a smooth camera movement that maintains deep focus, keeping both the biker and the surrounding landscape sharp. The crowd of spectators stands below, watching the rider's descent from various ledges and vantage points along the hillside. Near the top of the course, the large blue flag is planted in the ground, marking the start of the action.",

    "Camera": "This slow-motion video features a smooth camera movement that tilts down and pans right to track a mountain biker descending a steep, rocky slope. The camera begins at a low angle, looking up at the biker, and transitions to a level angle as it follows their movement. A deep focus keeps both the biker and the surrounding landscape sharp.",
    "Subject": "The main subject of the video is a person riding a black mountain bike down a steep, rocky, reddish-brown hillside. The rider wears a yellow and black long-sleeved jersey, black pants, and a matching yellow and black full-face helmet. They are shown launching off a dirt ramp and flying through the air. A crowd of spectators, composed of men and women in casual attire like t-shirts, shorts, and hats, watches from a lower vantage point. Some members of the crowd are holding up phones, appearing to film the event. Near the top of the hill, a large blue flag with a red bull logo is planted in the ground.",
    "Motion": "A person on a mountain bike rides down a steep, rocky hillside, launches off a dirt ramp, and flies through the air. A crowd of spectators stands below, watching the rider's descent.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set on a steep, reddish-brown, rocky hillside in a desert canyon during the day. The arid terrain is dotted with sparse green bushes and shrubs. A narrow, dusty path winds down the incline, where a mountain biker is seen descending and launching into the air off a dirt jump. A crowd of spectators is gathered on various ledges and vantage points along the hillside, observing the action. Near the top of the course, a large blue flag is planted in the ground.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
