  "merged_caption": "This video uses an extreme wide shot to capture an expansive landscape during sunrise. The sun is prominently positioned in the top center-right of the frame, located in the background, casting a warm, golden light over the scene. The horizon line stretches across the middle of the frame, also in the background, with a vast, dense forest occupying the bottom half of the frame, extending from the foreground through the middle ground and into the background. A layer of mist is visible in the middle ground, nestled within the forest valleys, adding depth to the scene. The camera remains completely static at an aerial level angle, capturing the landscape with deep focus and a large depth of field, emphasizing the serene and expansive quality of the environment. The sunlight creates a soft glow, illuminating the treetops and casting long shadows, with the sun's light creating a soft, radiant effect on the surrounding environment. The atmosphere is calm, with a slight haze visible in the distance, suggesting a tranquil, open space and possibly an early morning or late afternoon setting. The natural elements, including the varied textures of the trees and the gentle undulations of the terrain, are highlighted by the emerging light. The overall setting conveys a serene and tranquil environment, with the sun's position indicating the transition from morning to afternoon. The emphasis is on the interplay of light and shadow, with the sun remaining the central focus throughout the video.",

    "Camera": "The video features an aerial-level camera at a level angle, capturing a landscape scene with deep focus and a large depth of field. The camera remains completely static, with no movement or shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video is a landscape scenery shot. It captures a vast, expansive view of a natural environment, focusing on the atmosphere and scale rather than a specific object. The sun is prominently positioned in the sky, casting a warm, golden light over the scene. The horizon stretches across the frame, with layers of distant hills and a dense forest below. The emphasis is on the serene and expansive quality of the landscape, highlighting the interplay of light and shadow, and the tranquil, open space.",
    "Motion": "The video captures a serene landscape with a bright sun shining in the sky, casting a warm glow over a vast expanse of trees and a distant horizon. The sun remains the central focus, with its light creating a soft, radiant effect on the surrounding environment. The trees below are dense and varied, with some appearing more prominent in the foreground. The horizon is hazy, suggesting a calm and possibly early morning or late afternoon setting.",
    "Scene": "The video captures an expansive outdoor landscape during sunrise. The scene features a vast, dense forest stretching towards the horizon, with a prominent sun casting a warm, golden hue across the sky. The sunlight creates a soft glow, illuminating the treetops and casting long shadows. The atmosphere is calm, with a slight haze visible in the distance, adding depth to the scene. The natural elements, including the varied textures of the trees and the gentle undulations of the terrain, are highlighted by the emerging light. The overall setting conveys a serene and tranquil environment, with the sun's position indicating the transition from morning to afternoon.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
