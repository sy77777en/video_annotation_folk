  "merged_caption": "The video uses a wide shot to frame a long, empty hallway, with the camera positioned at approximately hip level, aligned with the center of the corridor. The hallway extends from the foreground, where the floor tiles and lower portions of the walls are visible, to the background, where a large, multi-paned window occupies the center of the frame and serves as the primary light source. The symmetrical composition places recessed doorways or alcoves along both the left and right sides in the middle ground, while the window and the end wall dominate the background and center. The camera moves forward throughout the video, maintaining a consistent perspective and height. This is a smooth, forward dolly shot moving at hip level down a dark, empty hallway. The camera maintains a level angle and uses a deep focus, keeping the entire length of the corridor, including the brightly lit window at the far end, in sharp focus. The hallway is bathed in a cool, blue light, with a brightly lit window visible at the far end. The entire scene is bathed in a cold, monochromatic blue-green light, with the primary illumination coming from a large, brightly lit, multi-paned window at the far end of the corridor. This light reflects faintly on the polished tile floor, emphasizing the length and emptiness of the space. The environment appears clean and orderly, with no visible clutter or decorations. In the lower left corner of the frame, a small white overlay sequentially displays the digits of \"2006,\" with each digit appearing sequentially as the video progresses. This number remains visible for a period before disappearing. Additionally, overlay text \"[21]\" appears gradually, stays for a significant duration, and eventually fades away. There are no major subjects present, and the focus is on the spatial depth and symmetry of the architectural environment.",

    "Subject": "This video features an architectural scenery shot of a long, empty hallway, creating a sterile and unsettling atmosphere. The entire scene is bathed in a cold, monochromatic blue-green light, with the primary illumination coming from a large, brightly lit, multi-paned window at the far end of the corridor. This light reflects faintly on the polished tile floor, emphasizing the length and emptiness of the space. The symmetrical composition, with recessed doorways or alcoves on either side, contributes to the institutional and slightly ominous feel. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the environment and the powerful, clinical mood it evokes, using the vacant space to suggest isolation.",
    "Motion": "This is a dynamic shot of an empty, sterile hallway, with the camera moving forward through the scene. The hallway is bathed in a cool, blue light, with a brightly lit window visible at the far end.",
    "Scene": "The video takes place in a quiet, indoor hallway with smooth tiled floors and walls lined with rectangular panels and large windows. The setting is illuminated by soft, cool-toned light streaming through a set of frosted glass windows at the far end, casting a blue hue across the space and creating subtle reflections on the floor. The hallway is symmetrical, with closed doors on either side and a ceiling featuring recessed sections. The environment appears clean and orderly, with no visible clutter or decorations. In the lower left corner of the frame, an overlay displays the number \"2006,\" with each digit appearing sequentially as the video progresses. This number remains visible for a period before disappearing. Additionally, overlay text \"[21]\" appears gradually, stays for a significant duration, and eventually fades away.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
