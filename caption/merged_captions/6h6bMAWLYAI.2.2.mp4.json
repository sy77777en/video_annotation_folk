  "merged_caption": "The video features a close-up shot of a slightly overweight, middle-aged Caucasian man with light skin and short, light-colored hair, centrally positioned in the frame, indicating he is the main subject. He is surrounded by microphones and cameras, which occupy the foreground, emphasizing the press event setting. The man is at the center, with his face and upper body visible, while other individuals are partially visible around him, including a person in a striped shirt on the left and another individual with dark hair on the right, both in the background. The camera is positioned around the same height or slightly higher than the man's head, angled high and looking down at him as he speaks. It employs deep focus, keeping all elements sharp. The camera is quite unsteady, moving with a handheld pattern. Initially, the man looks down with his gaze directed downward, then gradually raises his head to look around at the media reporters. During his speech, he occasionally nods slightly to interact with the journalists. Around him, other individuals, including a person with a camera, adjust their equipment and focus on capturing his statements. The scene remains crowded and focused on the man's speech throughout the video. Overlays include text at the bottom of the screen, providing context with phrases like \"Rob Ford Speaks at City Hall\" and \"HAPPENING NOW,\" along with a news ticker summarizing the event. A \"LIVE\" overlay logo appears in the upper right corner of the frame, emphasizing the immediacy of the broadcast. The focus is on the interaction between the speaker and the media, with no significant changes in shot size or spatial positioning. The man is wearing a black suit with a white shirt underneath and is positioned centrally, suggesting he is the focus of attention.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
