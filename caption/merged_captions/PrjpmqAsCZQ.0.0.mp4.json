  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot, capturing a man with a medium build, wearing a long-sleeved shirt, seated at a desk on the left side of the frame. The desk, along with its electronic equipment, including multiple keyboards and a mouse, occupies the center and right portions of the frame, stretching from the foreground into the background. A computer monitor is visible in the top right background. The scene is set in a dimly lit indoor environment with a dark green color filter, suggesting a night vision effect. The video is blurry and low resolution. The camera is shot at eye level with a high angle, looking down, and is consistently very shaky, with noticeable unsteadiness. The man is engaged in manipulating the equipment, with a focus on his hands interacting with a glowing object, possibly a small device or control. His posture is slightly leaned forward, indicating concentration on the task at hand. He picks up an object from the desk, illuminates it further, and examines it closely. Midway through the video, the camera performs a rapid zoom-in to focus on the light source held by the man, highlighting its bright light. The shot transitions, moving in to become a close-up that centers on the man's hands in the foreground as they manipulate the small, brightly glowing object. The camera remains positioned at the subject's level throughout the scene, and the dim lighting and low resolution make it difficult to determine the focus type, though it appears to be deep focus. The green hue provides the primary visibility, and the illuminated buttons and screens of the electronic equipment add to the scene's ambiance.",

    "Camera": "The video is shot at eye level with a high angle, looking down. The camera is consistently very shaky, with noticeable unsteadiness. Midway, it performs a rapid zoom-in to focus on a light source held by a man seated in front of a computer. The camera zooms in quickly, and the dim lighting and low resolution make it difficult to determine the focus type, though it appears to be deep focus.",
    "Subject": "The video features a man with a medium build, wearing a long-sleeved shirt. He is seated at a desk with electronic equipment, including a few keyboards and a mouse.

    "Motion": "A man is seated at a desk with multiple keyboards and other electronic equipment in a dimly lit environment. He picks up an object from the desk, illuminates it further, and examines it closely. The camera zooms in on the glowing object, highlighting its bright light.",
    "Scene": "The video shows an indoor setting with a dimly lit, night-vision effect, highlighting a person seated at a desk surrounded by multiple keyboards and electronic equipment with illuminated buttons and screens. The person interacts with the devices and holds a glowing object, with the green hue providing the primary visibility.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
