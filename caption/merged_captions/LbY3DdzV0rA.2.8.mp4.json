  "merged_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a desert landscape, with the focus on the scenery rather than a specific subject. The bottom sixth of the frame is occupied by the ground scenery, a flat, arid plain with scattered shrubs occupying both the foreground and the middle ground, and extending into the distant mountains in the background. In the background, a dark mountain range rests on the horizon, stretching across the width of the scene. The top five-sixths of the frame are dominated by the sky, which is positioned in the middle ground and background. A massive, dark storm cloud occupies the top left and center, appearing to swirl and advance in a time-lapse motion, with rain visible falling from its base in the left middle ground. The top right of the frame contains a lighter portion of the sky with pale blue and white clouds. The camera is positioned at a low height, looking across the desert floor toward the horizon. This time-lapse video showcases dramatic storm clouds swiftly moving across the sky over a desert landscape. Captured from a low angle with deep focus, the video highlights the desert in the foreground and middle ground, while the distant mountains remain sharp in the background. The camera executes a slow, smooth pan from left to right, enhancing the scene's depth and detail. The composition emphasizes the immense scale and atmospheric power of nature, with a massive, dark purple and grey storm cloud swirling and advancing in time-lapse motion. Visible sheets of rain fall in the distance on the left, while the right side of the sky reveals patches of pale blue and soft, light-colored clouds, suggesting sunrise or sunset.",

    "Subject": "This video captures a dramatic landscape of a desert environment under a turbulent sky. The composition emphasizes the immense scale and atmospheric power of nature, with a massive, dark purple and grey storm cloud swirling and advancing in time-lapse motion. Visible sheets of rain fall in the distance on the left, while the right side of the sky reveals patches of pale blue and soft, light-colored clouds, suggesting sunrise or sunset. The foreground and middle ground feature a vast, arid plain with sparse desert scrub, leading back to a silhouette of dark mountains on the distant horizon.",
    "Motion": "This is a time-lapse video of a dramatic storm system over a desert landscape. The large, dark purple clouds swirl and move rapidly across the sky. The camera pans from left to right, capturing the vast, arid terrain and the distant mountains under the turbulent sky.",
    "Scene": "A time-lapse video shows a vast desert landscape under a dynamic sky at either dawn or dusk. The foreground and middle ground feature a flat, arid plain with scattered, low-lying shrubs. In the distance, a dark mountain range rests on the horizon. A massive, swirling storm cloud, colored in shades of purple and dark gray, dominates the left and central parts of the sky, with rain visible falling from its base. To the right, the sky is lighter, with patches of white clouds against a pale blue background.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
