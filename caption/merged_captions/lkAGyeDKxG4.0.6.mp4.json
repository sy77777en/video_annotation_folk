  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot, a silhouetted man, dressed in dark, full-length clothing with a dark beanie and carrying a large, dark backpack, is positioned slightly to the right of center in the frame, walking through the middle ground of a high-altitude, mountainous landscape at sunrise or sunset. He uses two hiking poles for support as he moves from right to left across the rocky, uneven terrain dotted with patches of snow. The foreground and middle ground are covered with rocks, reddish-brown vegetation, and a few sparse coniferous trees, some with orange autumnal foliage. In the background, a vast range of snow-capped mountains extends across the horizon under a pale, golden sky. The camera, from a high-angle, eye-level perspective, smoothly tracks left, following the hiker from the side, maintaining a deep focus that keeps both the hiker in the midground and the distant mountains in the background sharp and clear. As the man walks, the camera keeps him slightly to the right in the frame while revealing more of the rugged terrain to the left.",

    "Subject": "A man, seen in silhouette against a light sky, walks from right toward left. He is dressed in dark, full-length clothing, including a dark beanie on his head, and carries a large, dark backpack. He uses two hiking poles for support as he moves.",
    "Motion": "A man walks from right to left across a rocky, mountainous landscape, using two hiking poles for support as he navigates the uneven terrain dotted with patches of snow.",
    "Scene": "In a high-altitude, mountainous landscape at sunrise or sunset, a silhouetted figure with a backpack and two hiking poles walks across the rugged terrain. The ground is a mix of dark, reddish-brown vegetation, scattered grey rocks, and patches of snow. A few sparse coniferous trees, some with orange autumnal foliage, dot the hillside. In the distance, a vast range of snow-capped mountains is visible under a pale, golden sky.",
    "Spatial": "In a wide shot, a silhouetted man is positioned slightly to the right of center in the frame, walking through the middle ground of a mountainous landscape. In the background, a range of snow-capped mountains extends across the horizon. The foreground and middle ground are covered with rocks, patches of snow, reddish-brown vegetation, and a few sparse trees. As the man walks from right to left, the camera, positioned at his level, tracks alongside him, keeping him slightly to the right in the frame while revealing more of the terrain to the left."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
