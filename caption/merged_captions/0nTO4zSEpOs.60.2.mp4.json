  "merged_caption": "The video captures a wide shot of an urban staircase at night, showcasing the full length of the stairs and surrounding architectural elements. Initially, several individuals are seen descending the staircase, moving from the middle and right side of the frame from the mid-ground to the foreground before exiting the scene. The camera, featuring a first-person perspective at eye level with deep focus and a large depth of field, smoothly moves forward and upward, approaching the stairs and then ascending them with minimal shaking. A person in a green jacket and white pants walks down the stairs, followed by a person in a beige jacket and blue pants. Another person in a gray hoodie and black pants appears at the top of the stairs and begins to descend. The staircase occupies the central portion of the frame, with railings extending from the foreground to the mid-ground. The surrounding urban environment, including buildings and railings, forms the backdrop. As the camera moves, it eventually reveals the platform at the top of the staircase, with the lower half of the frame showing the platform and the upper half displaying other buildings in the background. The area is well-lit with artificial lighting, indicating a public space, and the setting is a modern, urban environment with a focus on the structure and design of the staircase. The scene offers a first-person POV shot in a bustling urban outdoor setting at night, likely a transportation hub, with sleek, contemporary buildings with glass and metal elements reflecting the city lights. The dark sky indicates nighttime, and the atmosphere is lively with several people walking, some wearing masks. Text overlays in the lower left corner read \"VIRTUAL. JAPAN. TV.\"",

    "Motion": "The video shows a staircase at night with several people walking up and down. The camera moves forward and upward. A person in a green jacket and white pants walks down the stairs, followed by a person in a beige jacket and blue pants. Another person in a gray hoodie and black pants appears at the top of the stairs and begins to descend. The camera continues to move forward and upward, showing the person in the gray hoodie walking down the stairs. The staircase is nearly empty as the camera reaches the top.",
    "Scene": "The video offers a first-person POV shot in a bustling urban outdoor setting at night, likely a transportation hub. The scene showcases a modern architectural environment with a staircase leading up to a platform, possibly a pedestrian overpass. The stairs are composed of gray tiles with a textured surface, and the area is softly illuminated by white lights along the railings. Surrounding structures include sleek, contemporary buildings with glass and metal elements, reflecting the city lights. The dark sky indicates nighttime, and the atmosphere is lively with several people walking, some wearing masks. Text overlays in the lower left corner read \"VIRTUAL. JAPAN. TV.\"",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
