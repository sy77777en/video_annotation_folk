  "merged_caption": "In a medium close-up shot, a young woman with blonde hair pulled back from her face is positioned in the center-right of the frame, occupying the middle ground. She is lying in bed, propped up against a pillow, wearing a white t-shirt and partially covered by a white comforter. She holds a black tablet computer on the left side of the frame, looking down at its screen with a slight smile. The room is dimly lit, bathed in a cool, blue-toned light that emanates from the tablet. In the background, a small, framed picture is faintly visible on the wall in the top-left center. The camera is positioned at her level and smoothly and slowly moves forward towards the woman, using a shallow depth of field to keep her in focus. As the camera pushes in, she remains largely stationary, with her eyes moving slightly as she looks at the screen and a faint smile forming on her face.",

    "Camera": "This eye-level, level-angle shot slowly and smoothly pushes in on a woman reading a tablet in bed. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the woman in the midground in focus.",
    "Subject": "A young woman with blonde hair pulled back from her face is lying in bed, propped up against a pillow. She is wearing a white t-shirt and is partially covered by a blanket. In her hands, she holds a black tablet computer, looking down at its screen with a slight smile. The scene is dimly lit with a cool, blue-toned light.",
    "Motion": "A young woman lies in bed, propped against a pillow while holding a tablet. She remains largely stationary, with her eyes moving slightly as she looks at the screen and a faint smile forming on her face.",
    "Scene": "In a dimly lit bedroom at night, a person is propped up against pillows in bed, covered by a white comforter. The room is bathed in a cool, blue light that emanates from a tablet they are holding. On the wall behind the bed, a small, framed picture is faintly visible.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
