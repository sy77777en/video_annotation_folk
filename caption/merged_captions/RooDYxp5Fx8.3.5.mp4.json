  "merged_caption": "The video uses a wide shot to capture a city street scene, with the camera positioned at approximately the height of a standing person. In the initial composition, a cyclist is visible in the bottom left foreground, moving away from the camera along the sidewalk, while a black utility box sits near the left edge in the foreground. The road occupies the center and right portions of the frame, with vehicles moving from the right middle ground toward the left background. As the camera moves forward along the sidewalk, it gradually pans right to adjust its orientation, resulting in a slightly unsteady image with some shaking. The road gradually shifts to a horizontal orientation within the frame, cars moving from right to left in the middle ground. A sunny city street is depicted with traffic flowing smoothly and in an orderly manner. Numerous vehicles, predominantly white, travel seamlessly along the road, with a green sedan, a red taxi featuring a green sign, and a white truck standing out among the traffic. Modern buildings line the street, and lush greenery contrasts beautifully with the azure sky, which is dotted with white clouds. Urban elements like hedges, trees, and modern buildings line the upper and right portions of the frame. The camera work centers on the street scene, including passing vehicles and pedestrians. On the left, a person is riding a bicycle with their back to the camera, wearing a light-colored hat and a white long-sleeve top with dark pants. Additional people are visible in the distance, but their features are not clearly discernible. Japanese road signs with blue backgrounds and white text, as well as a red and blue no-parking sign, are mounted on poles above the street. The overall environment is clean and orderly, with green foliage providing contrast to the urban architecture.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, capturing a street view with deep focus and a large depth of field. The camera moves forward along the sidewalk while gradually panning right to adjust its orientation, resulting in a slightly unsteady image with some shaking. The camera work centers on the street scene, including passing vehicles and pedestrians.",
    "Subject": "The video captures the landscape of a bustling city road. On the left, a person is riding a bicycle with their back to the camera, wearing a light-colored hat and a white long-sleeve top with dark pants. Numerous vehicles, predominantly white, are moving in an orderly fashion. Notable among them are a green sedan, a red taxi with a green sign, and a white truck. Additional people are visible in the distance, but their features are not clearly discernible. The scene focuses on the overall urban environment rather than specific individuals or vehicles.",
    "Motion": "A sunny city street is depicted with traffic flowing smoothly and in an orderly manner. On the left sidewalk, a cyclist rides out of the frame, while several pedestrians are visible in the distance. Numerous vehicles travel seamlessly along the road, highlighting the organized rhythm of city life. Modern buildings line the street, and lush greenery contrasts beautifully with the azure sky, which is dotted with white clouds.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, shows an outdoor urban street scene on a clear day with bright blue skies and scattered white clouds. The setting features a wide road bordered by low hedges and trees, with modern mid-rise buildings and a traditional-style structure with a sloped roof visible in the background. The sidewalk is paved with concrete tiles and includes utility covers and a black utility box. Numerous vehicles move in an orderly fashion along the street, with the majority being white. Notably, a green sedan, a red taxi featuring a green sign, and a white truck stand out among the traffic. A cyclist moves along the sidewalk. Japanese road signs with blue backgrounds and white text, as well as a red and blue no-parking sign, are mounted on poles above the street. The overall environment is clean and orderly, with green foliage providing contrast to the urban architecture.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
