  "merged_caption": "The video opens from a first-person viewpoint, positioning a black assault rifle in the bottom center of the screen. A building with an external staircase occupies the left side, stretching from the foreground to the middle ground, where a small enemy figure stands at the bottom of the stairs in the middle ground and gradually moves closer to the camera. A dark green military vehicle is situated on the right side of the background, adjacent to stacked crates. Game interface elements, such as a minimap in the bottom left and health/ammo displays in the bottom right, are visible as onscreen overlays, while objective markers are distributed. The camera is shot from an eye-level, level angle, and first trucks right, then quickly zooms in to shoot an enemy, with some panning for aiming. The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking and uses deep focus, keeping a large depth of field sharp. The player, holding the black assault rifle, moves away from a metal staircase in a worn, beige building exterior, with the tank and some crates visible in the background. As the player moves to the right, an enemy soldier appears at the base, marked with an orange diamond and labeled 'ARMED.' The player begins firing at the enemy soldier, who returns fire, causing a bright muzzle flash. The player aims through the red dot sight at the enemy soldier, and their view is partially obscured by some plants. The player then moves back, with the enemy soldier now more visible, and another enemy soldier appears in the background. The player continues to engage the enemy soldier, who is now closer. The camera then moves backward under some plants, transitioning the view into an area where plants occupy the foreground and middle ground. The rifle remains in the bottom center of the screen, as the positions of the objective markers in the middle ground update.",

    "Camera": "The video is shot from an eye-level, level angle. It depicts a first-person shooter game where the player's camera first trucks right, then quickly zooms in to shoot an enemy, with some panning for aiming. The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking. The camera uses deep focus, keeping a large depth of field sharp.",
    "Subject": "The video displays a first-person perspective of a black assault rifle, equipped with a red dot sight, held by an unseen player. In the environment, a large, dark green or grey, boxy military vehicle, resembling a tank or armored personnel carrier, is present. Figures in dark, indistinct clothing, representing enemy soldiers, are visible at various distances, sometimes partially obscured by structures. Overlaying the view are game interface elements: a blue minimap with white and blue icons in the lower left corner, blue and white numerical displays for health and ammunition in the lower right corner, and orange and blue diamond-shaped objective markers indicating locations or targets.",

    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes holding a dark gray firearm, shows an outdoor, urban setting during the daytime. The view encompasses light-colored concrete or stucco buildings, one of which has an external gray staircase with black railings. A dark green armored vehicle is visible in the distance, positioned near crates on the dusty ground. The perspective then moves backward, passing under plants that are visible in the scene. A heads-up display is overlaid on the view, featuring a mini-map with icons and text in the bottom left, ammunition and status bars in the bottom right, and objective markers in the upper central area.",

Throughout the sequence, the camera maintains an eye-level perspective of the unseen player."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
