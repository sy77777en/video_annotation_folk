  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a blurry, ground-level, upside-down, level-angle shot of a grated metal walkway extending from the left foreground into the background, with an overhead structure visible at the top. The camera executes a sophisticated and seamless movement, starting with a leftward motion before pausing and rotating counter-clockwise to transition into an upright, level view. As the camera repositions, the focus shifts to the middle ground, clearly revealing two characters. In the final composition, an armored figure in bulky, dark robotic armor with yellow accents and a glowing red visor, identified by on-screen text as \"PCPD Cop 02,\" walks from the center-left of the frame in the middle ground towards a second person lying on the walkway in the right-center of the middle ground. This second person, dressed in reddish-brown clothing, is initially seen kneeling before falling forward to lie motionless. The scene is set at night on a high, outdoor industrial walkway made of dark metal grating that extends into a hazy, blue-green fog. The environment is filled with large, dark structures, including a small vehicle positioned in the left middle ground and a large solar panel behind it, with thick wires and cables hanging overhead. The area is dimly lit by a few white lights and several glowing red lights, creating a moody atmosphere. Some structures resembling houses can be seen in the background. As the armored figure approaches the fallen person, standing stationary over them, a speech bubble appears above their head, with overlay text displayed below: \"PCPD Cop 02: Got you now, you piece of shit.\" Small particles drift down through the air, and the IGN logo remains visible as a watermark in the bottom right corner throughout the shot.",

    "Camera": "This video is shot from a ground-level perspective, beginning with an unusual upside-down Dutch angle. The camera executes a sophisticated and seamless movement, starting with a leftward motion before pausing and rolling counter-clockwise to transition into an upright, level view. Initially, the scene is out of focus, but as the camera repositions, the focus shifts to the middleground, clearly revealing two characters.",
    "Subject": "The video opens with a blurry, level-angle, upside-down view of a long, grated metal walkway in a dark, futuristic setting. As the camera moves, rotates and comes into focus, it reveals a figure in bulky, dark robotic armor with yellow accents and a glowing red visor, identified by on-screen text as \"PCPD Cop 02.\" This armored figure stands next to a second person, who is initially seen kneeling before lying face down on the walkway, dressed in reddish-brown clothing. A speech bubble appears above the armored figure. Below is overlay text, \"Got you now, you piece of shit.\"",
    "Motion": "The camera, positioned at ground level, moves leftward before pausing and rotating counter-clockwise to achieve focus, revealing a person in reddish-brown clothing falling forward from a kneeling position to lie motionless on a grated walkway. An armored figure approaches the fallen person, standing stationary over them as a speech bubble appears above their head, with additional overlay text displayed below. Small particles drift down through the air.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set at night on a high, outdoor industrial walkway made of dark metal grating that extends into a hazy, blue-green fog. The environment is filled with large, dark structures, including a small vehicle and a large solar panel prominently positioned in the middle ground, with thick wires and cables hanging overhead. The area is dimly lit by a few white lights and several glowing red lights, both in the middle and background, creating a moody atmosphere. Some structures resembling houses can be seen in the background. An armored figure with a glowing red eye is actively moving along the walkway towards another person who is on the ground further away. A white text overlay at the bottom of the screen displays the caption, \"PCPD Cop 02: Got you now, you piece of shit,\" corresponding to a speech bubble icon above the moving figure. The IGN logo is visible as a watermark in the bottom right corner.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a blurry, ground-level, upside-down, level-angle shot of a grated metal walkway extending from the left foreground into the background, with an overhead structure visible at the top. The camera then moves leftward before pausing and rotating counterclockwise, bringing the scene into focus to reveal a wide shot. In the final composition, an armored figure walks from the center-left of the frame in the middle ground towards a second person lying on the walkway in the right-center of the middle ground. A small vehicle is positioned in the left middle ground, with a large solar panel behind it. The IGN logo remains in the bottom right corner throughout the shot. When the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
