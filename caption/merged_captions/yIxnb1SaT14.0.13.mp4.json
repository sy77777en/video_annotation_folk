  "merged_caption": "This video uses an extreme wide shot to frame the entire cityscape, with the Arc de Triomphe positioned centrally in the frame and occupying the middle ground. The monument stands upright, extending from the lower center to the upper center of the image, with its base near the bottom edge and its top approaching the upper edge. The circular roadway encircling the Arc is visible in the foreground, where streaks of red, white, and yellow lights from moving vehicles form horizontal and curved lines, especially prominent along the bottom of the frame. The background consists of a dark, cloudy night sky filling the center and upper portion of the frame. The camera is positioned at approximately street level, at the same height as the base of the Arc, providing a low-angle perspective on the monument. This is a greatly accelerated time-lapse video of the Arc de Triomphe at night, captured from a low-angle, eye-level perspective. The camera performs a very smooth counterclockwise arc around the monument. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire scene sharp, while the vehicles at the bottom of the frame exhibit motion blur due to the time-lapse effect. The video captures a dynamic cityscape scenery shot, focusing on the overall urban atmosphere and the passage of time rather than a specific main subject. The long-exposure technique intentionally abstracts the moving traffic, making the environment itself the primary focus. At the center of the composition stands the Arc de Triomphe, its light-colored stone facade and intricate sculptural details brightly illuminated against a dark, cloudy night sky. The overall environment is calm, with the monument sharply contrasted against the night sky and the motion of city life around it. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial arrangement throughout the video, and the overlay text \"MATHIEU STANIC PHOTOGRAPHIES\" remains fixed in the lower right corner.",

At the center of the composition stands the Arc de Triomphe, its light-colored stone facade and intricate sculptural details brightly illuminated against a dark, cloudy night sky. Encircling the base of the monumental arch are fluid streaks of red, white, and yellow light from the traffic, creating a vibrant sense of motion that contrasts with the timeless stillness of the historic landmark.",
    "Motion": "This video captures a nighttime view of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, illuminated against a dramatic sky. Light trails from passing vehicles are visible at the base, indicating movement in the scene. The focus is on the monument and its surroundings.",
    "Scene": "The video shows the Arc de Triomphe in Paris at night, standing prominently in an open urban setting with a dark sky and scattered clouds overhead. The monument is constructed from light-colored stone, featuring detailed carvings and sculptural reliefs on its facades, with strong artificial lighting illuminating its surfaces and casting defined shadows. Surrounding the Arc, blurred streaks of red, white, and yellow lights from moving vehicles create dynamic lines along the circular roadway, indicating continuous traffic flow. In the lower right corner, an overlay displays the text \"MATHIEU STANIC PHOTOGRAPHIES\" in white, which is not part of the scene itself. The overall environment is calm, with the monument sharply contrasted against the night sky and the motion of city life around it.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
