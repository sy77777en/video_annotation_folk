  "merged_caption": "The video presents a dynamic medium shot of a man in a yellow and black hooded jacket snowboarding, initially occupying the center-left foreground. He wears a dark beanie with a \"Red Bull\" logo and a GoPro camera mounted on top, with large, reflective ski goggles and a focused expression. As he descends the snowy slope, his framing fluctuates, sometimes tightening to a medium close-up focusing on his head and shoulders, then relaxing back to a medium shot showing more of his upper body, while he generally stays in the central foreground due to the selfie perspective. The camera, positioned at eye level with a low angle, moves smoothly downwards and backwards, leading the snowboarder from the front. Snow-covered evergreen trees are visible in the middle ground, appearing on the left and right sides and rushing past, as well as in the background further up the slope. Another snowboarder, also in yellow, is briefly seen in the background center, descending the slope and following the main snowboarder. Powdery snow covers the ground in the foreground, middle ground, and background, with plumes spraying into the foreground and middle ground around the main snowboarder. The bright, partially cloudy sky occupies the top background. The footage, captured from a selfie perspective with a camera held in the snowboarder's right hand, provides an immersive view of the descent through a sunlit, snowy mountain environment. The video exhibits mild barrel distortion and maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field. The ground is entirely covered in a deep layer of powdery white snow, which billows and sprays as the perspective moves rapidly downhill.",

    "Camera": "The video exhibits mild barrel distortion. The camera is positioned at eye level, employing a low angle, and maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera moves smoothly downwards and backwards, leading the subject (a snowboarder) from the front.",
    "Subject": "A man in a yellow and black hooded jacket is snowboarding. He wears a dark beanie with a \"Red Bull\" logo and a GoPro camera mounted on top. He has large, reflective ski goggles on, and his mouth is open with his tongue slightly visible, showing a focused expression. In the background, another person, also wearing a yellow jacket, can be seen snowboarding further up the slope.",
    "Motion": "A snowboarder in a yellow and black jacket descends a snowy slope, kicking up a plume of snow as they turn. The footage, captured from a selfie perspective with a camera held in their right hand, provides an immersive view of the descent. In the background, another snowboarder, also in yellow, moves down the same slope.",
    "Scene": "A selfie POV shot, where the camera is facing the person holding it, shows a dynamic descent through a sunlit, snowy mountain environment. The outdoor scene unfolds during the daytime, with a bright, partially cloudy sky visible above. Tall evergreen trees, their branches heavily laden with white snow, populate the sloping terrain. The ground is entirely covered in a deep layer of powdery white snow, which billows and sprays as the perspective moves rapidly downhill. In the background, another figure is briefly visible moving through the same snowy conditions.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
