  "merged_caption": "In a close-up, overhead shot, a man's left hand is positioned at the center of the frame, while his right hand is at the top center, holding two spinning tops side-by-side. The top on the left has red and yellow paint, while the top on the right has pink and blue paint, all set against a light brown wooden surface that fills the background. As the tops rotate rapidly in place, the liquid paint swirls and mixes on their surfaces. The spinning motion flings the paint outwards in thin, arcing streams, which splatter onto the wood, creating an intricate, web-like pattern of intersecting colored lines that expands around the tops. The colors on each top begin to mix, and the splattered lines of red, yellow, pink, and blue intersect around the spinning objects. The camera maintains a static, high-angle shot with deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The video playback utilizes a speed ramp effect, shifting from slow motion to an even slower motion, emphasizing the dynamic movement of the paint as it is flung outwards from the center. The tops and the man's left hand remain fixed in their positions, while his right hand slowly moves towards the upper center of the frame. The overhead POV shot captures the action, highlighting the intricate, web-like pattern of intersecting spirals on the wooden background.",

    "Camera": "This is a static, high-angle shot looking down on two spinning tops covered in paint. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The video playback utilizes a speed ramp effect, shifting from slow motion to an even slower motion.",
    "Subject": "A man's light-skinned hands hold two launchers that are spinning a pair of tops on a wooden surface. The top on the left is covered in red and yellow paint, while the top on the right has pink and blue paint. As the tops spin, the liquid paint swirls and is flung outwards, creating thin, arcing streams of color that splatter onto the surface, forming a web-like pattern. The colors on each top begin to mix, and the splattered lines of red, yellow, pink, and blue intersect around the spinning objects.",
    "Motion": "A person's hands hold two launchers, causing a pair of tops to spin rapidly on a wooden surface. The top on the left is covered in red and yellow paint, and the one on the right has pink and blue paint. As the tops rotate, the liquid paint swirls and mixes on their surfaces. The spinning motion flings the paint outwards in thin, arcing streams, which splatter onto the wood, creating an intricate, web-like pattern of intersecting colored lines that expands around the tops.",
    "Scene": "An overhead POV shot, positioned directly above for a top-down perspective, captures an action on a light brown wooden surface. A pair of hands launches two spinning tops, one covered in red and yellow paint and the other in pink and blue paint. As the tops rotate rapidly, the wet paint is flung outwards, creating thin, arcing lines and splatters. The colors mix and spread, forming an intricate, web-like pattern of intersecting spirals on the wooden background.",
    "Spatial": "In a close-up, overhead shot, a man's left hand is positioned at the center of the frame, while his right hand is at the top center, holding two spinning tops side-by-side. The top on the left has red and yellow paint, while the top on the right has pink and blue paint, all set against a wooden surface that fills the background. As the tops rotate in place, the paint is flung outwards from the center in thin, arcing streams. These streams create an expanding, web-like pattern of intersecting spirals on the surrounding wooden surface, while the tops and the man's left hand remain fixed in their positions, and his right hand slowly moves towards the upper center of the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
