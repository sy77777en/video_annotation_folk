  "merged_caption": "This is a scenery shot with no main subject, presented as an extreme wide shot. The composition is divided horizontally, with the vast, turbulent storm clouds and the distant sky occupying the top five-sixths of the frame, while a flat green field occupies the bottom sixth. The field extends from the immediate foreground to the distant background horizon. The main storm system is present in both the middle ground and the background, stretching across the width of the frame. Curtains of rain fall from the base of the clouds in the background, primarily in the center and right portions of the scene. In this time-lapse view, the entire cloud formation moves from left to right. The lower, darker shelf cloud in the middle ground churns and rotates as it progresses, with a notable section on the right side moving towards the right. This is a time-lapse video shot from a low angle, positioned above the ground. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire landscape and sky sharp. The camera pans slowly and smoothly from left to right, capturing the movement of the storm clouds. The sky is filled with a massive, swirling formation of dark grey and white storm clouds, with a lower, menacing shelf cloud from which curtains of heavy rain can be seen falling in the distance. Below, a wide expanse of green and yellow grassland stretches uninterrupted to the horizon, emphasizing the immense scale of the weather system. The dramatic, dark clouds churn and swirl as the storm system evolves. Rain can be seen falling in the distance as the entire formation moves across the horizon.",

    "Camera": "This is a time-lapse video shot from a low angle, positioned above the ground. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire landscape and sky sharp. The camera pans slowly and smoothly from left to right, capturing the movement of the storm clouds.",
    "Subject": "This is a dramatic landscape scenery shot capturing a powerful supercell thunderstorm moving across a vast, flat plain. The sky is filled with a massive, swirling formation of dark grey and white storm clouds, with a lower, menacing shelf cloud from which curtains of heavy rain can be seen falling in the distance. Below, a wide expanse of green and yellow grassland stretches uninterrupted to the horizon, emphasizing the immense scale of the weather system. There is no main subject because the composition's focus is on capturing the raw power and atmospheric drama of the storm itself, dwarfing the landscape below.",
    "Motion": "This is a time-lapse scenery shot of a powerful supercell thunderstorm forming over a vast, flat, green field. The dramatic, dark clouds churn and swirl as the storm system evolves. Rain can be seen falling in the distance as the entire formation moves across the horizon.",
    "Scene": "An outdoor scene captures a vast, flat green field stretching to a distant horizon. The sky above is dominated by a massive, turbulent storm system. Dark grey and white clouds fill the upper atmosphere, while a lower, well-defined cloud formation hangs over the landscape. Curtains of rain are visible falling from the base of the storm in the distance. The clouds show movement, suggesting a time-lapse of the weather event.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
