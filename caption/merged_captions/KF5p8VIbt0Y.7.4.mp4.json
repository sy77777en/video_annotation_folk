  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot of a black pen with a gold tip and silver accents, suspended horizontally in midair near the center of the frame and positioned in the foreground, with the camera at the pen’s level. The pen, featuring red liquid on the tip, is close to the camera, occupying the central-right foreground, while the rows of dark, high-backed seats and the aisle recede into the background, creating a sense of depth. The static, level-angle, hip-level shot uses a shallow depth of field, initially focusing on the floating pen. The pen smoothly and slowly rolls clockwise while moving slightly to the right. The focus then shifts as a woman in a white uniform with matching pants, a long-sleeved top, and a white cap enters the scene from the background, opening a doorway at the far end of the aisle, which is centered in the frame. The camera performs a rack focus to capture her as she stands upright in the doorway, now making her the main subject in the background, while the pen is no longer the focus. The word \"CAUTION\" is visible on the seatbacks along the aisle, positioned in the middle ground on both the left and right sides of the frame. The video takes place inside a modern, dimly lit passenger cabin with a flat ceiling above the aisle and sloped ceilings above the seats on either side. The environment is enclosed, with smooth metallic and plastic surfaces, and the lighting is soft, casting subtle reflections along the walls and floor. The overall atmosphere is quiet and controlled, with no visible windows or natural light, suggesting an artificial, possibly futuristic setting. Throughout the video, the camera maintains a straight-on perspective at the subjects’ level, and the spatial composition transitions from the pen in the foreground to the woman in the background, with the central aisle and rows of seats providing clear depth and structure to the scene.",

    "Camera": "This static, level-angle, hip-level shot uses a shallow depth of field. It begins with the focus on a floating pen in the foreground before performing a rack focus to a person opening the door to the aisle and about to walk down.",
    "Subject": "The video begins with a wide shot of a black pen with a gold tip and silver accents, seemingly with red liquid on the tip, suspended horizontally in midair. The focus then shifts to a woman who enters the scene, wearing a white uniform with matching pants and a long-sleeved top, and a white cap. She has light skin and her posture is upright as she opens the door at the end of the aisle.",
    "Motion": "The pen is initially suspended horizontally in midair, then smoothly and slowly rolls clockwise while moving slightly to the right. A woman opens the door at the end of the aisle, appearing ready to walk toward the camera.",
    "Scene": "The video takes place inside a modern, dimly lit passenger cabin with a flat ceiling above the aisle and sloped ceilings above the seats on either side. The cabin features rows of dark, high-backed seats arranged along a central aisle. The environment is enclosed, with smooth metallic and plastic surfaces, and the lighting is soft, casting subtle reflections along the walls and floor. A small, dark cylindrical pen with a gold tip and silver accents, featuring red liquid on the tip, floats in midair near the camera. The far end of the cabin features a closed doorway with rounded edges, and a person dressed in a light-colored uniform opens the doorway, standing upright and about to walk through. The word \"CAUTION\" in white, capitalized text appears on the seatbacks near the aisle and is part of the physical scene. The overall atmosphere is quiet and controlled, with no visible windows or natural light, suggesting an artificial, possibly futuristic setting.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
