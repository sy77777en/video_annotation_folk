  "merged_caption": "The video is a stop-motion sequence filmed from a static, overhead, bird's-eye view, using a wide shot with deep focus to ensure all items remain sharp and clear. It begins with a single open suitcase, featuring a hard shell and light-colored interior, positioned near the top-center of a pale, whitewashed wooden floor with horizontal planks. As the video progresses, various personal items and clothing are placed one by one around the suitcase, which remains stationary and open throughout. These items, including shirts in blue, red, green, yellow, and white, brown pants, blue jeans, a striped t-shirt, a green sweater, socks, underwear, a belt, a necktie, a pair of brown shoes, a wristwatch, a smartphone, a laptop, a toothbrush, toothpaste, a razor, deodorant, and bottles of toiletries, are laid flat and organized into a grid pattern. The arrangement occupies the left, right, and bottom areas of the frame, with the suitcase consistently at the top-center. Smaller items like socks, underwear, and toiletries fill gaps between larger items, creating a neatly organized display. The materials range from cotton and denim to leather and plastic, with a muted color palette dominated by soft pastels and earth tones. The lighting is even, with no strong shadows, suggesting a well-lit environment. The camera maintains a consistent height above the subjects throughout, capturing the entire arrangement in a single, evenly lit overhead view. No overlays, text, or digital elements are present, emphasizing the assortment of travel essentials against the textured and slightly rustic backdrop.",

    "Camera": "This is a stop-motion video filmed from a static, overhead, bird's-eye view. The camera uses a deep focus, ensuring all the items laid out on the floor remain sharp and clear.",
    "Subject": "The video features an open, empty suitcase with a hard shell and light-colored interior, positioned laid flat and fully unzipped. Later, the suitcase is surrounded by a variety of neatly arranged personal items and clothing, including several shirts in different colors and patterns, a pair of blue jeans, brown pants, a striped t-shirt, a green sweater, socks, underwear, a belt, a necktie, a pair of brown shoes, a wristwatch, a smartphone, a laptop, a toothbrush, toothpaste, a razor, deodorant, and bottles of toiletries. Each item is laid out flat and organized in a grid-like pattern, with the suitcase remaining at the top-center, emphasizing the assortment of travel essentials.",
    "Motion": "The suitcase remains stationary and open throughout the video. Various personal items and clothing are then placed one by one around the suitcase, on both sides and below it, each item laid flat and organized into a grid pattern, while the suitcase itself does not move. No other motion occurs.",
    "Scene": "The video takes place indoors against a pale, whitewashed wooden floor with horizontal planks, creating a textured and slightly rustic backdrop. At first, a single open suitcase with a light gray fabric interior is positioned near the upper center of the floor. A neatly organized arrangement of various travel essentials and clothing items gradually appears, laid out in a grid pattern on both sides and below the open suitcase. These items include shirts in blue, red, green, yellow, and white, pants in brown and blue denim, shoes, socks, belts, a tie, undergarments, a watch, a smartphone, a laptop, toiletries, and grooming products. Each item is carefully placed, with clear separation and alignment, and the materials range from cotton and denim to leather and plastic. The overall color palette is muted, with soft pastels and earth tones dominating the scene. No overlays, text, or digital elements are present, and the lighting is even, with no strong shadows, suggesting a well-lit environment.",
    "Spatial": "The video uses a wide shot from a top-down perspective, with the camera positioned directly above the scene. Initially, a single open suitcase is placed near the top-center of the frame, with the pale wooden floor filling the rest of the image. As the video progresses, various personal items and clothing are added and arranged in a grid pattern around the suitcase, occupying the left, right, and bottom areas of the frame. The suitcase remains at the top-center, while shirts, pants, shoes, and accessories are distributed symmetrically to the left, right, and bottom-center, with smaller items like socks, underwear, and toiletries filling gaps between larger items. The camera maintains a consistent height above the subjects throughout, capturing the entire arrangement in a single, evenly lit overhead view."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
