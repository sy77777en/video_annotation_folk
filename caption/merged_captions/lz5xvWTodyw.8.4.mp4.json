  "merged_caption": "This is a static shot of a pixelated computer desktop interface with no camera movement, appearing to be a screen recording. Initially, a \"HYPNOS INSTALLER\" window is positioned in the center, displaying a blue progress bar completing the installation of \"Professor Helper\" over a surreal, dark background with a large building and floating watermelons under a reddish-purple sky. A column of colorful icons occupies the left side, while an information bar runs across the top. Once the installation is complete, an icon representing Professor Helper's head is added to the collection of icons on the left side of the screen, and the cursor closes the installation window. After the installation completes, the central window closes. A paper cutout of a simple, hand-drawn cartoon character on a popsicle stick appears in the bottom-left corner, while a pixelated professor character, an elderly man with glasses, a bald head with white side hair, and a brown suit with a red bowtie, materializes in the bottom-right corner. A dialogue box then pops up next to the professor, asking if the user needs help. The cursor selects the option \"Yes, help me!\" This dialogue box is subsequently replaced by a larger window in the same position, displaying the cover of a book titled \"BLOOD MONEY FROM THE TOP DOWN,\" which features a piggy bank overflowing with black liquid and cash. The paper cutout remains in its corner, while the professor character is about to exit the frame.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
