  "merged_caption": "The video showcases a wide shot of a retro-style game scene, capturing the entire play area with a predominantly blue and purple color scheme. The central subject, a circular object with a half-green, half-black design featuring a white face-like pattern, starts near the bottom center of the frame and moves upward in the middle of the video while maintaining a consistent horizontal position. The object travels horizontally from left to right, with the camera tracking its movement to keep it centered. The video begins with a view of a pixelated, retro-style game environment, featuring a structure on the left and a grid-like path below. The circular object starts moving to the right, skillfully navigating vertically within the frame to avoid obstacles. As it continues, the object moves past the grid-like path and approaches a new section of the environment. The object then enters a new area with a different set of structures and a continuation of the grid-like path, deftly maneuvering to dodge obstacles. Finally, the object reaches a section with more grid-like paths and additional structures, maintaining its movement to the right while continuing to adeptly avoid obstacles. The background features a grid-like path with dashed lines and arrows, along with rectangular structures with grid patterns, all of which remain static throughout the sequence. The camera maintains a top-down perspective, providing a clear and stable view of the entire scene, with the circular object in motion and other elements fixed. Overlay elements include \"1vp 14 114155\" in the top left corner, displaying scores and level information, and the text at the top center changes from \"09. Iridon\" to \"URIDIUM,\" providing context for the gameplay.",

    "Camera": "The video features smooth, rightward camera movement with a third-person perspective, tracking a spaceship as it navigates through a pixelated environment in a 2D gaming video.",
    "Subject": "The video showcases a retro-style, pixelated scene with a predominantly blue and purple color scheme. The central focus is a circular object with a face-like design, distinctively colored with one half green and the other half black. The green wraps halfway around the black section, which features a white face-like design. This object stands out due to its contrasting colors against the background, even as it moves and is not always centered on the screen. Surrounding elements include abstract geometric shapes and patterns, such as a grid-like path with a right-pointing arrow, which suggest movement or progression but do not serve as main subjects. The overall aesthetic is reminiscent of classic video games, emphasizing simple, blocky graphics and a limited color palette.",

    "Scene": "The video presents a 2D gaming scene with what appears to be a top-down view, where the camera is positioned directly above the character, looking down. The setting is a digital, pixelated environment with a predominantly blue color scheme. The scene features a grid-like layout with roads and pathways, marked by dashed lines and arrows, suggesting movement or direction. Notable visual elements include rectangular structures with grid patterns, possibly representing buildings or obstacles, and various geometric shapes like squares, which may serve as interactive or collectible items. The environment is static, with no visible weather conditions, and the time of day is not discernible due to the digital nature of the scene. Overlay elements include \"1vp 14 114155\" in the top left corner, displaying scores and level information, and the text at the top center changes from \"09. Iridon\" to \"URIDIUM.\" These overlays are not part of the scene itself but provide context for the gameplay.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
