  "merged_caption": "This is an extreme wide, static shot that focuses on a vast landscape rather than a specific subject. The silhouetted rock formations of the Grand Canyon occupy the entire bottom half of the frame, extending from the foreground into the background. The top half of the frame is filled by the sky, with a large, dark storm cloud positioned near the center. The horizon line sits near the vertical center of the composition, with a warm, orange glow from the setting sun on the left. A white text overlay is located in the bottom right corner, displaying \"PHOTOGRAPHED AND EDITED BY MIKE OLBINSKI.\" The camera is positioned at a level angle, looking out over the expansive scenery, and uses a deep focus to ensure that the entire landscape, from the canyon in the foreground to the dramatic clouds and rain in the background, remains sharp and in focus. This is a static, time-lapse video of a sunset over the Grand Canyon, captured from an aerial, level-angle perspective. The camera remains still, capturing the dramatic clouds as the sun sets on the horizon. The only movement is the very slow, almost imperceptible drift of the clouds. The video presents a majestic landscape scenery shot of the Grand Canyon during a dramatic sunset. The sky is a canvas of soft blues and warm, golden light, dominated by a large, dark storm cloud. The setting sun creates a striking contrast against the deep shadows that envelop the canyon's vast, layered rock formations. The composition lacks a singular main subject, as the focus is intentionally placed on the immense scale, the atmospheric beauty, and the powerful, transient moment of weather interacting with the iconic landscape.",

    "Scene": "An extreme wide shot captures the Grand Canyon at sunset. The landscape is composed of layered rock formations that are mostly in deep shadow, creating dark silhouettes against the sky. The sky above is filled with dramatic clouds, with a large, dark formation at the center. The setting sun on the horizon illuminates the clouds from below with a warm, orange glow, while the upper sky is a pale blue. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays the text \"PHOTOGRAPHED AND EDITED BY MIKE OLBINSKI\" in white.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
