  "merged_caption": "This video is a scenery shot presented as an extreme wide shot from a level angle, looking forward from the bow of a container ship. The ship's deck, stacked with containers in shades of blue, red, and beige, occupies the bottom of the frame, extending from the immediate foreground into the middle ground. The ocean fills both the middle ground and the background, stretching from the ship's bow to the horizon line. The sky dominates the top portion of the frame, encompassing the foreground, middle ground, and background. The camera remains stationary relative to the ship, which moves forward, creating a dynamic where the clouds streak rapidly across the sky in a time-lapse effect. This time-lapse video captures the rapid passage of time from a perspective mounted above the containers on a cargo ship, positioned between an overhead and aerial level. The shot exhibits mild barrel distortion, causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward. The camera moves steadily forward before suddenly panning right at the end. A deep focus ensures that both the ship in the foreground and the distant horizon remain sharp. The vessel moves across the open ocean under a dramatic, deep blue sky. In a time-lapse effect, fast-moving white and grey clouds streak across the sky, creating a sense of rapid movement. The focus is not on a specific subject but rather on the immense scale of the natural environment and the feeling of a journey across the open water. An overlay in the form of a watermark with the text \"JEFFREY.HK\" and \"JEFFHK\" is visible at the lower right corner of the frame.",

    "Subject": "This video presents a dramatic seascape scenery shot, captured in a time-lapse from the bow of a massive container ship. The focus is not on a specific subject but rather on the immense scale of the natural environment and the feeling of a journey across the open water. The ship, with its stacks of blue, red, and beige containers filling both the foreground and extending into the midground, enhances the depth and perspective of the scene. Above, the deep blue sky is filled with clouds that streak and billow rapidly, their motion accelerated to create a powerful sense of passing time, while the vast, smooth ocean stretches out to a hazy horizon.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenic time-lapse video from the bow of a container ship sailing on the open ocean. Dramatic clouds streak across a vast blue sky above the calm sea. The ship is seen steadily moving forward on its journey.",
    "Scene": "From a high vantage point on the bow of a container ship, the vessel moves across the open ocean. Rows of stacked shipping containers in shades of blue, red, and beige fill the foreground and extend into the midground. The dark sea stretches to a flat horizon under a dramatic, deep blue sky. In a time-lapse effect, fast-moving white and grey clouds streak across the sky, creating a sense of rapid movement. An overlay in the form of a watermark with the text \"JEFFREY.HK\" and \"JEFFHK\" is visible at the lower right corner of the frame.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
