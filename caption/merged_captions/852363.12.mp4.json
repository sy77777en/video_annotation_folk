  "merged_caption": "This close-up shot primarily features several pairs of legs and feet dangling in the middle ground, positioned across the upper half of the frame (top left, top center, top right). Below them, a textured metallic platform extends from the foreground into the middle ground and then into the background. The video is in slow motion, with the camera positioned at ground level and maintaining a level angle. It features a subtle tilt throughout. The camera moves to the right with slight unsteadiness and some shaking. As the camera shifts to the right, a large, blurry vertical element appears prominently in the foreground, partially obscuring the view. The legs show slight movement, suggesting the motion of a ride. The video shows a close-up of several people's feet, moving in various positions as they swing on a ride, with their shoes and the metal platform visible. The background is blurred, indicating a busy environment, possibly a fair or amusement park. The video features a group of people seated on a swing ride. The focus is on their legs and feet, which are visible as they dangle above a metallic platform. The individuals are wearing a variety of footwear, including sandals and closed shoes, and some are dressed in patterned pants. The scene captures the motion of the ride, with legs slightly elevated and swinging. The overall composition highlights the diversity in clothing and footwear among the riders. The background is indistinct, hinting at a bustling fairground environment. The legs hang suspended, suggesting the motion of a ride. The footwear varies, including dark sneakers, dark wedge boots worn with patterned leggings, and sandals. The camera is too blurry to discern specific focus details.",

    "Scene": "The video presents a low-angle view from a textured, metallic floor, characteristic of an amusement park ride platform. Several pairs of legs dangle just above this surface, belonging to unseen riders seated above. The footwear varies, including dark sneakers, dark wedge boots worn with patterned leggings, and sandals. The background is indistinct, hinting at a bustling fairground environment. The legs hang suspended, suggesting the motion of a ride.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
