  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot captured from a high angle, a large group of identical, mannequin-like figures with pale, grayish-white skin and bald heads, dressed in form-fitting, long-sleeved orange jumpsuits, occupies the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground on a dark gray checkered floor. The figures stand in disorganized rows, facing forward, in a large, dimly lit room with brown wood-paneled walls. To the center-bottom-right, another similar figure stands behind a simple wooden lectern, positioned slightly in the foreground relative to the main group. Some of the figures' heads feature black and white patterns, distinguishing them from the otherwise uniform assembly. The entire scene is enclosed by dark shadow, illuminated from above, casting shadows across the floor. An overlay of white text appears at the bottom-left of the scene, reading, \"[28]\". The scene remains static with no movement from any of the subjects. From a high angle at an overhead level, the camera executes a smooth, complex movement, simultaneously moving forward, down, and left while panning to the right, creating a slow, descending clockwise arc over the assembly, keeping all the figures sharp in deep focus.",

    "Subject": "A large group of identical, mannequin-like figures with pale, grayish-white skin and bald heads stands in disorganized rows. All the figures are dressed in form-fitting, long-sleeved orange jumpsuits. One figure stands apart from the group, positioned behind a simple wooden lectern. The rest of the figures stand at attention, facing forward. A few of the figures in the crowd have black and white patterns on their heads, distinguishing them from the otherwise uniform assembly.",
    "Motion": "In a dimly lit room featuring a gray and black checkered floor, with wood-paneled walls behind the figures, a group of figures in orange outfits stands motionless in rows. A single figure, also in orange, stands still behind a wooden lectern, facing the same direction as the group. The scene remains static with no movement from any of the subjects.",
    "Scene": "In a large, dimly lit room with brown wood-paneled walls, a group of humanoid figures in orange jumpsuits stands in disorganized rows on a dark gray checkered floor. The figures, who have pale white heads and hands, are all facing forward. There's a single wooden lectern in the foreground in front of them, where another similar figure stands. Some of the figures' heads feature black and white patterns. The scene is illuminated from above, casting shadows across the floor. An overlay of white text appears at the bottom-left of the scene, reading, \"[28]\".",
    "Spatial": "In a wide shot captured from a high angle, a large group of figures in orange jumpsuits occupies the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground on a dark checkered floor. To the center-bottom-right, another figure stands behind a wooden lectern, positioned slightly in the foreground relative to the main group. The entire scene is enclosed by dark shadow. All elements within the frame remain completely still."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
