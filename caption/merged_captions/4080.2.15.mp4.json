  "merged_caption": "In a medium close-up shot, a young man with a light skin tone is positioned slightly to the right of the frame's center, occupying the foreground. He has short, shaggy black hair with a light blue streak in his bangs and wears round, dark sunglasses, a gold chain necklace, and a red and black horizontally striped sweater. The background consists of blurry, sunlit foliage with prominent bokeh, creating a shallow depth of field. The natural light filters through the trees, adding a hazy, atmospheric quality. The camera is positioned at the subject's level and smoothly pans from right to left, maintaining a soft focus on him as he moves slightly within the frame. The focus appears to be a post-production effect, creating a blurry background with wave-like distortions while keeping the person in the foreground clear. Throughout the video, the young man sings with his mouth open, showing his teeth, and his head moves slightly from side to side in a shaky manner.",

    "Scene": "This outdoor scene is set in a sunlit, wooded area, characterized by a shallow depth of field that renders the background foliage into a soft, blurry wash of green and blue tones with prominent bokeh. In the foreground, a person with dark hair featuring a blue streak wears a red and black striped sweater, a gold-colored chain, and round sunglasses. The natural light filters through the trees, creating a hazy, atmospheric quality.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
