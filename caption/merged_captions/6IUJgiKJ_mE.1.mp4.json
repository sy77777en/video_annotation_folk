  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot, a lead cyclist, wearing a light blue short-sleeved jersey, black cycling shorts, a white helmet, and sunglasses, is initially positioned in the center of the frame in the middle ground, riding a black road bike down a paved road toward the camera. He is followed by three other male cyclists in a loose formation, each wearing helmets; one in a red jersey, another in a yellow and black jersey, and the third's jersey color unspecified. A motorcycle with a driver and a passenger, both in dark helmets and jackets and equipped with professional filming equipment, operates alongside the trailing cyclists. A second motorcycle, operated by a person in a dark uniform and a white helmet, and a line of cars, including one with a camera rig, travel behind the group. The road, marked with clear white, yellow, and red lines, extends from the bottom of the frame into the background, bordered by lush green trees and sidewalks, with houses partially visible. A large, dry, tree-dotted hill is visible in the distant background on the right. As the video progresses, the camera, positioned at the subjects' level, pans left and zooms out, tracking the lead cyclist as he moves from the center middle ground to the bottom-left foreground, becoming larger in the frame before disappearing. Consequently, the trailing cyclists and vehicles shift to occupy the center and center-right of the frame, while the background and middle ground scenery, including numerous vehicles and pedestrians parked along the roadside, scroll across the screen. The camera maintains a smooth, eye-level shot with a level angle and deep focus, keeping both the cyclists and the background sharp as the procession moves through the residential area on a sunny day.",

    "Camera": "This is a smooth, eye-level shot with a level angle and a deep focus, keeping the cyclists and the background sharp. The camera pans left and zooms out to track the lead cyclist as he rides toward the camera. Although the camera is zooming out, the cyclist becomes larger in the frame as he gets closer.",
    "Subject": "A man, the lead cyclist, rides a black road bike in the center of a paved road. He wears a light blue short-sleeved jersey, black cycling shorts, a white helmet, and sunglasses. Following him are three other male cyclists, all wearing helmets; one wears a red jersey, another wears a yellow and black jersey, and the color of the third cyclist's jersey is not specified. Accompanying the cyclists is a black motorcycle carrying both a driver and a passenger, both wearing dark helmets and jackets, equipped with professional filming equipment. Further back, another motorcycle is operated by a person in a dark uniform and a white helmet. In the midground, three vehicles travel in a line: the first two are black, with the second carrying a large black device likely for filming, and the third vehicle is yellow. Numerous cars and pedestrians are positioned along the roadside.",
    "Motion": "A lead cyclist pedals his bicycle down a paved road, moving toward the camera. He is followed by three other cyclists who pedal in a loose formation behind him. A motorcycle with a driver and a passenger operates alongside the trailing cyclists, while a second motorcycle and a line of cars, one equipped with a camera rig, travel behind the entire group as they all move forward along the road.",
    "Scene": "A group of cyclists rides along a wide asphalt highway on a sunny day, marked with clear white, yellow, and red lines. The road is lined with lush green trees and sidewalks, with houses partially visible in the background. In the distance, a large, dry, tree-dotted hill rises against the sky. The cyclists are followed by several support vehicles, including motorcycles and a car with a bike rack on its roof. Numerous vehicles and pedestrians are parked along the road as the procession moves through the residential area.",
    "Spatial": "In a wide shot, a lead cyclist is initially positioned in the center of the frame in the middle ground, with a group of following cyclists and support vehicles trailing behind him in the center-right middle ground. The road extends from the bottom of the frame into the background, bordered by trees that stretch from the left side of the middle ground to the right side of the background, and houses that are part of the background. A large hill is visible in the distant background on the right. As the video progresses, the camera pans left, tracking the subjects as they move from right to left and closer to the camera's position. The lead cyclist travels from the center middle ground to the bottom-left foreground and eventually disappears from the frame. Consequently, the trailing group of cyclists and vehicles shifts to occupy the center and center-right of the frame, while the background and middle ground scenery and middle ground spectators on the left side scroll across the screen. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
