  "merged_caption": "The video presents an extreme wide shot of a coastal scene, capturing the expansive interaction between the ocean and the sandy shore. The turquoise waves occupy the upper portion of the frame, extending from the top left to the top right, while the dark, wet sand covers the lower section, spanning from the bottom left to the bottom right. The white foam of the waves forms a dynamic line across the middle of the frame, separating the ocean from the beach. This line shifts slightly as the waves move, maintaining a consistent presence in the middle ground. The camera remains stationary, positioned above the scene, providing a bird's-eye view that emphasizes the contrast between the deep green-blue ocean and the rich brown sand. The spatial composition remains stable throughout the video, with no noticeable changes in shot size or camera angle. The camera's height is consistently above the scene, offering a comprehensive perspective of the coastal dynamics. The video shows a top-down view of the ocean waves crashing onto a sandy beach. The waves are consistent and create white foam as they meet the shore. The water is a clear blue-green, and the sand is a light brown color. The waves roll in and out, creating a rhythmic pattern as they recede and advance. The video, captured from a drone POV, showcases an outdoor coastal scene during daylight. The setting features a shoreline where turquoise waves crash onto a sandy beach. The water is a mix of deep green and blue hues, with white foam forming at the wave crests. The sand is a rich brown, creating a stark contrast with the vibrant ocean. The texture of the sand is smooth, with subtle markings from the receding water. The overall scene is serene, with the rhythmic motion of the waves providing a dynamic element against the static beach.",

    "Camera": "The video features an aerial, bird's-eye view with deep focus, capturing a wide depth of field. The camera remains completely static, providing a stable and clear perspective of the scene below.",
    "Subject": "The video is a seascape scenery shot. It captures the rhythmic motion of waves gently crashing onto a sandy shore. The focus is on the natural environment, highlighting the contrast between the deep green-blue of the ocean and the dark, wet sand. The white foam of the waves creates a dynamic line that emphasizes the movement and energy of the sea. The absence of a specific subject allows the viewer to appreciate the vastness and tranquility of the coastal scene.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
