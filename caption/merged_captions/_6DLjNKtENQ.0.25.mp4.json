  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a slightly blurry view of a building rooftop occupying the bottom and center foreground, while a small portion of a large, reptilian monster with a dark, scaly, and spiky back and a lighter-colored underbelly is in focus at the top of the frame in the background, emerging from a body of water located on the right. Adjacent to the water, two buildings with green octagonal roofs are positioned in the middle ground on the right. As the camera, positioned at an aerial level, moves forward, passing over the rooftop, the full body of the monster is revealed, breaking the surface first with its head and spiky back, creating a large, white foamy splash as it propels itself forward towards a street. The camera continues to move forward, revealing the monster behind a building and then tracking it from this high-angle aerial perspective, gliding smoothly across the rooftops. The monster transitions from the water on the right towards the center and left middle ground. Simultaneously, several small, tan-colored military tanks become visible on a street in the top left and center background, firing red tracer rounds towards the monster, which is now more centrally positioned in the middle ground where an explosion, appearing as a burst of orange flame and dark smoke, occurs on its back. The initial foreground rooftop recedes towards the bottom of the frame. The scene is set in an urban environment during the daytime, with several multi-story buildings visible, some featuring flat, dark grey rooftops. A paved road runs parallel to the water, with what appears to be a bridge or overpass structure. The weather is clear, with bright sunlight casting shadows, and the movement is smooth with minimal shaking, suggesting it might have been filmed from a helicopter.",

    "Camera": "The camera is at an aerial level, providing a high-angle view. Initially, a close rooftop in the foreground is slightly blurry, while the background is clear. As the camera moves forward, passing over the rooftop, the entire scene becomes clear. The camera continues to move forward, revealing a monster behind a building. It then tracks the monster from this high-angle aerial perspective, gliding across the rooftops. The movement is smooth with minimal shaking, suggesting it might have been filmed from a helicopter.",
    "Subject": "The video, filmed from a drone's perspective, shows a large, reptilian monster with a dark, scaly, and spiky back and a lighter-colored underbelly emerging from a body of water, creating a significant splash. Several small, tan-colored military tanks are positioned on a nearby street, firing red tracer rounds at the monster. An explosion is visible on the monster's back as it is hit.",
    "Motion": "A large, reptilian monster emerges from a body of water, with its head and spiky back breaking the surface first, creating a large splash as it propels itself forward towards a street. As it moves, multiple tanks fire at the creature, causing an explosion on its back.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures an aerial view of an urban environment during the daytime. The scene is set near a body of water, with several multi-story buildings visible, some featuring flat, dark grey rooftops and others with distinctive green, octagonal, tiered roofs. A paved road runs parallel to the water, with what appears to be a bridge or overpass structure. A large, dark, spiky creature with a long tail emerges from the water, creating a significant white foamy splash as it moves onto the land near the road. Small explosions, appearing as bursts of orange flame and dark smoke, occur on the creature's back as it advances. Several small, tan-colored vehicles are visible on the road. The weather is clear, with bright sunlight casting shadows.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a slightly blurry view of a building rooftop occupying the bottom and center foreground, while a small portion of the monster is in focus at the top of the frame in the background, emerging from water located on the right. Adjacent to the water, two buildings with green octagonal roofs are positioned in the middle ground on the right. As the camera, positioned above the subject, moves forward, the full body of the monster is revealed. The monster transitions from the water on the right towards the center and left middle ground, creating a significant splash. Simultaneously, several small tanks become visible on a street in the top left and center background, firing towards the monster, which is now more centrally positioned in the middle ground where an explosion occurs on its back. The initial foreground rooftop recedes towards the bottom of the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
