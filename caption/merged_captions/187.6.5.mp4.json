  "merged_caption": "The video opens with out-of-focus elements in the immediate foreground moving towards the right, initially obscuring a woman positioned in the middle ground, who is partially visible in the left portion of the frame. The camera starts at eye level with a level angle, initially capturing two individuals who are out of focus. As these foreground elements move out of view, the shot transitions to a close-up of the woman, now more clearly situated in the left half of the frame. As the foreground figures move out of the way, a woman enters the frame. She initially faces towards the camera, then turns to her left, presenting a profile view, and moves to the right side of the frame. The camera focuses on a woman behind them, panning to the right with minimal shaking to track her movement. She then turns her body to her left, into a profile view facing left, while simultaneously shifting her position towards the right side of the frame. Throughout this sequence, the background remains very dark and indistinct. When the woman is revealed, the camera is positioned at her level. The scene unfolds in a dimly lit space, where the background is predominantly dark and indistinct. A person is then revealed, wearing a colorful headscarf with blue, yellow, green, and white patterns, along with a dark jacket over a light-colored turtleneck. She wears a vibrant headscarf, predominantly blue and yellow with map-like or illustrative patterns, tied around her head. Her attire includes a light-colored, possibly shimmery beige or gold, high-necked top, and a dark jacket with prominent, contrasting white cuffs. She raises her right hand to the side of her head, near her ear, and has noticeable dark eye makeup. Subdued lighting focuses on the person, particularly highlighting their patterned headwear against the shadowy surroundings.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
