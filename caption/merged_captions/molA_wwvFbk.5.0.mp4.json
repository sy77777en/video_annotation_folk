  "merged_caption": "The shot opens with a complex, abstract pattern of red, pink, and white light streaks radiating from the center of the frame. The camera moves forward smoothly into this pattern, which resolves into a tunnel-like structure. This tunnel is defined by vertical lines of red and orange light that rush from the background, through the middle ground, and past the camera in the foreground, creating a strong sense of forward motion and depth. The center of the frame consistently acts as a vanishing point in the deep background. The video begins with a burst of colorful light, including red, green, and purple hues, creating a dynamic and vibrant display. As the camera moves forward, the colors intensify and the light patterns become more defined, with red and pink tones dominating the scene. The light beams and streaks continue to shift and converge, forming a tunnel-like structure with a central pathway. The movement through the tunnel is marked by the changing intensity of the light, creating a sense of rapid progression. The video concludes with the camera moving deeper into the tunnel, where the light patterns become more concentrated and the colors more pronounced. The environment is undefined, with no discernible natural or architectural elements, focusing instead on the interplay of light and color. The scene transitions smoothly, with streaks of light and color shifting and blending, suggesting movement through a tunnel of light. The overall atmosphere is immersive and visually striking, with a focus on the vivid and fluid visual elements. The overall composition is a kaleidoscope of light, with no discernible objects or figures, emphasizing a visually striking and immersive experience.",

The camera appears to move forward into this pattern, which resolves into a tunnel-like structure. This tunnel is defined by vertical lines of red and orange light that rush from the background, through the middle ground, and past the camera in the foreground, creating a strong sense of forward motion and depth.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
