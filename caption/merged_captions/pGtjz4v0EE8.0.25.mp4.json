  "merged_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot of a church interior. Initially, an ornate chapel is positioned in the center background, with its gilded dome occupying the top center of the frame and an altarpiece below it. This chapel is flanked by dark marble columns extending from the middle ground to the foreground. A red brick wall is visible in the foreground on the left, and a large column stands in the left foreground. The camera, capturing the scene from a low-angle, eye-level perspective, pans to the left while simultaneously moving to the right, creating a dynamic perspective of the architecture. This motion causes the central chapel to remain in the center of the frame, while revealing more of the sculpted marble wall on the right. Later, on the right, another red brick wall with statuary can be seen positioned in the foreground. The camera is slightly unsteady, and a deep focus keeps the entire grand scene in sharp detail. The interior scenery shot captures the opulent and reverent atmosphere of a grand European church or cathedral, with a stunning display of architectural and artistic detail, from massive, dark marble columns and sections of exposed red brick to elaborate white marble sculptures and reliefs adorning the walls. The primary focus is a deeply recessed chapel or apse, crowned with a magnificent, gilded dome featuring intricate patterns and figures. Below, a large, dramatic altarpiece painting is enshrined within an elaborate white marble framework, set above what appears to be a reliquary. The scene is illuminated by warm light from hanging lanterns and the white light streaming in from outside the window, highlighting the intricate gold and marble details. The video's purpose is to immerse the viewer in the overwhelming scale, historical grandeur, and sacred ambiance of the environment itself.",

    "Scene": "The interior of an ornate church features a lavishly decorated chapel set within a grand archway. The chapel's domed ceiling is gilded and coffered, with a large, dark painting serving as the altarpiece, framed in white sculpted stone. Below the painting rests a glass sarcophagus. Polished, dark marble columns stand on either side of the chapel. The wall to the left is exposed red brick, while the wall to the right is adorned with marble panels and statuary. The scene is illuminated by warm light from hanging lanterns and the white light streaming in from outside the window, which highlights the intricate gold and marble details, as the view pans slowly to the left while moving to the right, revealing more of the elaborate stonework along the church wall.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
