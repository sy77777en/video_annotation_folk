  "merged_caption": "The video uses an extreme wide shot to capture the landscape, showing the rice paddies and surrounding scenery in their entirety. The rectangular and irregular rice fields fill most of the frame, stretching from the bottom foreground to the distant background, with water-filled and green sections creating a patchwork pattern. The video begins with an aerial view of a vast agricultural area, showcasing a series of terraced fields with varying shades of green and brown, indicating different stages of crop growth and soil preparation. As the camera moves forward, more of the intricate patterns of the fields become visible, with some sections appearing to be flooded with water, while others are dry and tilled. Small huts are scattered throughout, appearing in the middle ground and background, often positioned toward the left, right, or center of the frame depending on the shot. Clusters of banana plants and dense trees line the edges, mainly along the left, right, and top edges of the frame, with a forested area visible in the background near the top. The camera is positioned above the scene, looking down from a high angle, which emphasizes the geometric layout and spatial relationships between the fields, water channels, and vegetation. The camera employs deep focus, keeping the entire landscape sharp and clear. A drone moves smoothly and steadily forward, barely descending as it advances to showcase the fields below. The background is filled with lush greenery and distant trees, adding to the scenic beauty of the agricultural area. The video concludes with a broader view of the entire area, highlighting the extensive and well-organized nature of the farmland. There is no lens distortion, and the camera movement is fluid without any shaking.",

    "Camera": "The video is captured from an aerial level with a high-angle perspective, looking down over plowed farmland. The camera employs deep focus, keeping the entire landscape sharp and clear. A drone moves smoothly and steadily forward, barely descending as it advances to showcase the fields below. There is no lens distortion, and the camera movement is fluid without any shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video captures a breathtaking landscape of expansive, rectangular rice paddies, emphasizing the serene environment and atmosphere. The vibrant green and brown fields form a patchwork, interspersed with water-filled sections that reflect the sky. Occasional huts are visible, adding a touch of rural life, but the primary focus remains on the scale and layout of the paddies, with lines and patterns created by the fields and irrigation channels. Lush greenery and distant trees frame the scene, enhancing the sense of vastness and tranquility, allowing viewers to fully appreciate the beauty and harmony of the rural landscape.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with an aerial view of a vast agricultural area, showcasing a series of terraced fields with varying shades of green and brown, indicating different stages of crop growth and soil preparation. As the camera moves forward, more of the intricate patterns of the fields become visible, with some sections appearing to be flooded with water, while others are dry and tilled. The camera continues to glide over the landscape, revealing small structures and pathways that cut through the fields, likely used for maintenance and transportation. The background is filled with lush greenery and distant trees, adding to the scenic beauty of the agricultural area. The video concludes with a broader view of the entire area, highlighting the extensive and well-organized nature of the farmland.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone shows an expansive outdoor landscape of terraced rice fields stretching across a rural area, with rectangular and irregular plots separated by narrow earthen ridges and filled with water or vibrant green crops. The fields are bordered by clusters of tall, leafy banana plants and patches of dense trees, with a forested area visible in the distance under a hazy sky. Small wooden huts with sloped roofs are scattered among the fields, and the ground appears wet, reflecting the overcast daylight. The overall scene is marked by the geometric arrangement of the fields, the lush greenery, and the presence of water channels running between the plots.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
