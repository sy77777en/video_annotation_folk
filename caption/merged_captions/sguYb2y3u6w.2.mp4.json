  "merged_caption": "In this wide shot, a white ambulance with a red stripe, a red cross symbol on its side, and a blue and red siren on its roof, driven by a green crocodile with a long snout and a small white hat with a red cross, is positioned in the center of the frame, moving steadily from left to right across the middle ground. A gray road occupies the foreground, bordered by a green lawn and a stylized forest background composed of simple, flat-colored trees in various shades of green and brown against a pale blue sky. A small, light green car driven by a chick with an orange beak, a pearl necklace, and what appears to be a pearl earring enters from the right side of the frame, positioning itself to the right of the ambulance in the middle ground. Shortly after, a white car driven by a yellow chick with an orange beak and a tuft of hair on top of its head that matches the color of its body enters from the left, taking a position to the left of the ambulance. The shot concludes with the three vehicles moving in a horizontal line across the center of the frame. The camera remains at the subjects' height, tracking their movement from a side-on perspective in a very smooth side-tracking shot, following the ambulance as it drives down the road.",

    "Camera": "This is a very smooth side-tracking shot where the camera moves rightward, following an ambulance as it drives down a road.",
    "Subject": "A white ambulance with a red stripe, a red cross symbol on its side, and a blue and red siren on its roof is being driven by a green crocodile. The crocodile, visible in the driver's seat, has a long snout and wears a small white hat with a red cross. Also present are two other cars: a small, light green car driven by a chick with an orange beak, a pearl necklace, and what appears to be a pearl earring, and a white car driven by a yellow chick with an orange beak and a tuft of hair on top of its head that matches the color of its body.",
    "Motion": "A white ambulance driven by a crocodile moves steadily from left to right across the screen. A small green car driven by a chick enters from the right and travels in the same direction as the ambulance. A white car, also driven by a chick, then enters from the left and follows the ambulance.",
    "Scene": "In a daytime, 2D animated scene, traffic moves from left to right along a gray paved road. The road is bordered by a green lawn and a stylized forest background composed of simple, flat-colored trees in various shades of green and brown against a pale blue sky. The central vehicle is a white van with a red horizontal stripe, a red cross symbol on its side, and a red and blue light on its roof. It is joined by a small, light green car and a white car, all proceeding in the same direction as the background scrolls past.",
    "Spatial": "In this wide shot, a white ambulance is positioned in the center of the frame, moving from left to right across the middle ground. A gray road occupies the foreground, while a stylized forest sits in the background. A light green car enters from the right side of the frame, positioning itself to the right of the ambulance in the middle ground. Shortly after, a white car enters from the left, taking a position to the left of the ambulance. The shot concludes with the three vehicles moving in a horizontal line across the center of the frame. The camera remains at the subjects' height, tracking their movement from a side-on perspective."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
