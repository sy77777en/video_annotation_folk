  "merged_caption": "A medium full shot, filmed at the subjects' level, captures a static scene in a dark, undefined indoor space. On the right side of the frame, a mannequin-like figure with a black, featureless head stands in the middle ground, dressed in a grey long-sleeved shirt, a dark grey tie, a dark grey belt, and dark pants, with its arms at its sides. To the left, two other mannequin-like figures with silver metallic heads and arms are positioned in the middle ground, bent over a long, white table that extends from the center-left foreground of the frame towards the center background. These two figures are wearing tan short-sleeved shirts, brown belts, and grey pants, and each is interacting with an open cardboard box placed on the table in front of them. The entire composition remains stationary throughout the shot, with the three mannequin-like figures completely motionless. The scene is illuminated by a red glow, with the mannequin on the right starkly lit, with red light on one side and white light on the other. Overlay white text \"[4]\" is located at the bottom left of the screen. The camera moves slowly and smoothly from right to left, maintaining an eye-level, level-angle shot with a deep focus that keeps all figures in the scene sharp.",

    "Scene": "In a dark, undefined indoor space, a long, white table is illuminated by a red glow. On the left, two mannequins with silver metallic arms and heads are dressed in tan shirts and grey pants. They are positioned bent over the table, interacting with open cardboard boxes. To the right, standing apart against the black background, is a third mannequin dressed in a grey shirt, dark grey tie, and dark pants. This figure is starkly lit, with red light on one side and white light on the other. Overlay white text \"[4]\" is located at the bottom left of the screen.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
