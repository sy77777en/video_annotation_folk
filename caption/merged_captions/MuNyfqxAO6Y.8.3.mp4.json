  "merged_caption": "A dynamic shot captures a dark green, modified BMW M3 coupe from a low-angle perspective, parked at an upward angle on a steep incline. The car is positioned diagonally across the frame, extending from the top left to the center, and is situated in the middle ground on a sloped embankment made of large, weathered concrete slabs with dry, brown grass and weeds sprouting from the cracks. The car features a large rear spoiler, a widebody kit with prominent flared wheel arches, deep-dish chrome wheels, and an \"M3\" badge on the trunk lid next to a Japanese license plate. In the background, a clear, light blue sky fills the top half of the frame, while the rear of a white vehicle with a black rear spoiler and the top of a tree are visible in the far distance. The camera employs a very smooth, low-angle, ground-level shot with deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. There is a minor camera movement, trucking slightly to the right while panning left, which emphasizes the car's upward angle on the incline and keeps the car stationary within the frame for the entire duration of the video.",

    "Subject": "A dark green, modified BMW M3 coupe is parked at an upward angle on a steep incline. The car is shown from a low, rear three-quarter perspective. It is equipped with a large rear spoiler, a widebody kit with prominent flared wheel arches, and deep-dish chrome wheels. An \"M3\" badge is visible on the trunk lid, next to a Japanese license plate. In the background, the rear of a white vehicle with a black rear spoiler is partially visible.",
    "Motion": "The dark green car remains stationary, parked on an incline, for the entire duration of the video.",
    "Scene": "In an outdoor daytime setting, a dark green sports coupe is parked on a sloped embankment made of large, weathered concrete slabs. Dry, brown grass and weeds sprout from the cracks between the slabs in the foreground. The car features a prominent rear spoiler and chrome wheels. In the background, a clear, light blue sky dominates the scene, with the top of a tree and a white vehicle visible in the far distance.",
    "Spatial": "A dynamic shot captures a dark green car from a low-angle perspective. The car is positioned diagonally across the frame, extending from the top left to the center, and is situated in the middle ground on a sloped embankment. This embankment, made of concrete slabs with dry grass, occupies the foreground at the bottom of the frame. In the background, a clear blue sky fills the top half of the frame, while a white vehicle and a tree are visible in the bottom right. The camera slightly trucks to the right while panning left, emphasizing the car's upward angle on the incline."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
