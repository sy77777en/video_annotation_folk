  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot, featuring a small, irregularly shaped metallic artifact positioned in the center foreground, resting on a gray, textured surface that fills the frame as the background. The artifact is heavily corroded, displaying a mottled green and brown patina. Engraved onto its surface are discernible features, including part of a large wheel, letters, and indentations suggesting smaller gears. The camera is positioned at a high angle, looking down at the engraved, metallic-looking object, and employs an extremely shallow depth of field, with the focus maintained on the object in the midground. As the shot progresses, the camera moves forward, maintaining a full shot of the artifact, while simultaneously arcing around it from right to left. This movement keeps the artifact in the center foreground, offering a changing perspective of its details against the consistent background surface. The camera smoothly arcs clockwise around this central object while also moving forward, providing a comprehensive view of the object from various angles. The camera remains positioned above the subject throughout the shot, appearing to be near ground level, though its exact height is difficult to determine due to a lack of background information.",

    "Subject": "The video shows a small, irregularly shaped piece of metal, likely a fragment, resting on a gray, textured surface. The metal has a corroded appearance, with a mottled green and brown patina. Engraved on its surface are discernible features, including a large circular shape resembling a wheel, some letter-like markings, and several smaller, gear-like circular patterns.",
    "Motion": "The video features a full shot of a small, irregularly shaped piece of corroded metal resting on a gray, textured surface. The camera moves forward and arcs around the stationary metal piece.",
    "Scene": "The video features a dynamic shot where the camera moves forward and arcs around a small, irregularly shaped metallic artifact resting on a rough, grey, textured surface. The artifact is heavily corroded, displaying a mottled green and brown patina. Engraved onto its surface are discernible features, including part of a large wheel, letters, and indentations suggesting smaller gears. The camera provides a comprehensive view of the object from various angles.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
