  "merged_caption": "This is a wide shot of a city scene with a slow zoom-in effect, capturing a bustling Parisian avenue at night. The illuminated Palais Garnier, with its grand facade, green dome topped with a statue, and flanked by golden figures, serves as the central focal point in the background at the center of the frame. The ornate opera house is brightly lit with warm, yellow light, contrasting against the dark sky. Flanking the avenue are multi-story Haussmann-style buildings with lit windows, including a prominent illuminated sign for \"BERLI\" on the right. The bottom half of the frame is occupied by heavy traffic in the foreground and middle ground, with a large tour bus prominent on the right side of the foreground and another partially visible on the left. Cars and tour buses, appearing as streaks of white and red light, fill the center of the road, moving in various directions: from the foreground toward the background, from the background toward the foreground, and laterally from left to right and right to left. The camera is positioned at a standard height, looking straight down the avenue, and slowly zooms in on the opera house, creating streaks of light from the vehicles and emphasizing the vibrant city life. The shot is taken from a smooth, eye-level, and level-angle perspective, maintaining a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp. The scene is filled with the heavy, flowing traffic of cars and large tour buses, their red and white lights creating streaks of motion that convey a sense of vibrant energy. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays the text \"MATHIEU STANIC CINEMATOGRAPHER\" in white.",

    "Subject": "This is a cityscape scenery shot capturing a bustling Parisian avenue at night, with the grand, illuminated Palais Garnier opera house serving as the central focal point at the end of the street. The ornate building features a large green dome topped with a statue, flanked by golden figures, all brightly lit against the dark sky. The scene is filled with the heavy, flowing traffic of cars and large tour buses, their red and white lights creating streaks of motion that convey a sense of vibrant energy. There is no main subject, as the composition is designed to emphasize the magnificent scale of the architecture and the lively atmosphere of the city, rather than any single person or object.",
    "Motion": "This is a dynamic scenery shot of the illuminated Palais Garnier in Paris at night, viewed from a bustling street. The camera slowly zooms in, creating streaks of light from the vehicles and emphasizing the vibrant city life.",
    "Scene": "The video captures a nighttime scene on a wide avenue in Paris, looking towards the illuminated Palais Garnier. The ornate opera house, with its green dome, golden statues, and grand facade, is brightly lit with warm, yellow light. Flanking the avenue are multi-story Haussmann-style buildings with lit windows. On the right, a building features a prominent illuminated sign for \"BERLI\". The street is filled with dense, fast-moving traffic, including cars and tour buses, whose headlights and taillights create streaks of white and red light in a time-lapse effect. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays the text \"MATHIEU STANIC CINEMATOGRAPHER\" in white.",
    "Spatial": "This is a wide shot of a city scene with a slow zoom-in effect. The illuminated Palais Garnier is positioned in the background at the center of the frame, framed on the left and right by large buildings that extend from the middle ground into the background. The bottom half of the frame is occupied by heavy traffic in the foreground and middle ground. A large tour bus is prominent on the right side of the foreground, with another partially visible on the left. Cars, appearing as streaks of light, fill the center of the road, moving in various directions: from the foreground toward the background, from the background toward the foreground, and laterally from left to right and right to left. The camera is positioned at a standard height, looking straight down the avenue. There are no changes in shot size or camera position, aside from the zoom."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
