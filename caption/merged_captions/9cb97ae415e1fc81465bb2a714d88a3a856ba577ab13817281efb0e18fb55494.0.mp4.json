  "merged_caption": "This wide shot captures a scene from a subject-level perspective, with a grassy lawn in the foreground. A leafless tree with a light-brown trunk stands in the left middle ground, casting a long shadow across the grass from the right. In the right section of the frame, two children on scooters ride towards the left; the first child moves from the right to the center-right, while the second child enters from the far right. A woman wearing light-colored pants briefly runs from the center towards the left, in the opposite direction of a person walking in a dark jacket, then eventually slows down. On the adjacent sidewalk, two individuals stand beneath a traffic light on the right side of the frame. The middle ground features a multi-lane road with white markings, carrying moving traffic, including several cars and a white truck, stretching horizontally across the frame. In the background, there are traffic lights, tall light posts, bare trees lining the street, multi-story, red-brick buildings, and both moving and stationary cars. More pedestrians are visible, and the low sun casts a warm, golden glow over the entire setting under a pale blue sky with light clouds. Filmed from a slightly unsteady, eye-level perspective, this video maintains a level angle and a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera performs a slow pan from right to left, capturing the dynamics of the urban area in the late afternoon.",

    "Camera": "Filmed from a slightly unsteady, eye-level perspective, this video maintains a level angle and a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera performs a slow pan from right to left.",
    "Subject": "In the foreground, a grassy area features a prominent leafless tree on the left. The midground shows a paved road with cars moving in both directions. On the sidewalk beyond the road, a man walks to the right, while a woman and two children on scooters move to the left. In the background, more pedestrians, leafless trees, traffic lights, and multi-story brick buildings are visible.",
    "Motion": "A woman wearing light-colored pants briefly runs in the opposite direction of a person walking in a dark jacket, then eventually slows down. To their right, two children on scooters ride along the pavement from the right to the left of the frame. In the background, cars drive both from left to right and vice versa along the street.",
    "Scene": "The scene captures a late afternoon in an urban area from a slightly shaky and panning viewpoint across a sunlit green lawn. In the foreground, a leafless tree with a light-brown trunk stands on the left, while a long shadow stretches across the grass from the right. A multi-lane road with white markings carries moving traffic, including several cars and a white truck. A few pedestrians walk along the sidewalk and use a crosswalk at an intersection equipped with traffic lights. In the background, bare trees line the street in front of multi-story, red-brick buildings under a pale blue sky with light clouds. The low sun casts a warm, golden glow over the entire setting.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
