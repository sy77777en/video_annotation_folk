  "merged_caption": "This video captures a wide scenery shot of a modern, empty subway station from a tilted perspective. Initially, the frame is oriented at an almost diagonal tilt, with the digital screen occupying the top left to center area, displaying the time as approximately 10:35, the track number \"Gleis 1,\" and an \"SOS Nothalt\" (Emergency Stop) button. The escalator is visible in the left background, and the ceiling and tunnel wall are on the right. The camera moves backward quickly and smoothly while simultaneously rolling counterclockwise, creating a varying Dutch angle throughout the shot. This rotation adds a dynamic effect, showing the clean platform, train tracks, and blue-lit tunnel walls rushing by. As the camera rotates, the digital sign shifts from the foreground to the background, revealing more of the platform’s overall appearance. A series of large, curved overhead structures with rounded, hooded lights in shades of yellow, orange, and blue appear in the foreground and transition to the middle ground and background, projecting reflective colors onto the ground. By the end, the platform floor occupies the bottom center from foreground to background, while the ceiling, track bed, and tunnel wall occupy the right side of the frame from foreground to background. The entire subway station scene is captured in deep focus, keeping all elements sharp. The station appears clean and mostly empty, with its architectural features and lighting creating a distinct, contemporary atmosphere.",

    "Camera": "From an eye-level perspective, the camera moves backward quickly and smoothly while simultaneously rolling counterclockwise. This rotation creates a varying Dutch angle throughout the shot. The entire subway station scene is captured in deep focus, keeping all elements sharp.",
    "Subject": "This video is a dynamic architectural scenery shot capturing the interior of a modern, empty subway station. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the striking design, atmosphere, and scale of the urban environment. The disorienting, tilted camera perspective sweeps along a deserted platform, where dramatic blue uplighting casts long shadows against a wall, leading the eye towards a dark tunnel. A series of large, curved overhead structures features rounded, hooded lights in yellow, orange, and blue, projecting reflective colors onto the ground. A brightly lit digital sign displays the time as approximately 10:35, indicates \"Gleis 1\" (Track 1), and shows an \"SOS Nothalt\" (Emergency Stop) button, grounding the surreal scene with functional details.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenery shot from a hyper-speed perspective, moving through a modern subway station. The camera is tilted and rotating, adding a dynamic effect to the scene. It shows the clean platform, train tracks, and the blue-lit tunnel walls rushing by. Overhead, a large, curved structure with a series of rounded, hooded lights in yellow, orange, and blue dominates the view, creating reflections on the floor. Digital displays show the time, track number (\"Gleis 1\"), and public service announcements.",
    "Scene": "A dynamic, tilted, and continuously rotating perspective captures a modern and spacious subway station. The scene features a long, light-colored platform bordered by a dark track bed. The tunnel walls are bathed in blue light, contrasting with a series of curved structures overhead, adorned with rounded, hooded lights in shades of yellow, orange, and blue. A prominent black digital display screen shows the time on an analog clock face and the track number \"Gleis 1,\" along with subway arrival information. The station appears clean and mostly empty, with its architectural features and lighting creating a distinct, contemporary atmosphere.",
    "Spatial": "This video captures a wide scenery shot of a subway station from a tilted perspective. Initially, the frame is oriented at an almost diagonal tilt, with the digital screen occupying the top left to center area, the escalator visible in the left background, and the ceiling and tunnel wall on the right. The camera then performs a continuous counterclockwise rotation while moving backward. As it rotates, the digital sign shifts from the foreground to the background, revealing more of the platform’s overall appearance. A series of large, curved light fixtures appear in the foreground and transition to the middle ground and background. By the end, the platform floor occupies the bottom center from foreground to background, while the ceiling, track bed, and tunnel wall occupy the right side of the frame from foreground to background."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
