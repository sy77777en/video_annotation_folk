  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a dark-skinned man with a full, dark beard standing in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground of an indoor basketball court. He is wearing a dark gray sleeveless tank top, black shorts, and dark-colored basketball shoes with light-colored soles. The background details include a high, vaulted wooden ceiling in the upper background, a white wall in the lower background, and the gymnasium entrance in the lower left background. The basketball hoop is positioned slightly above and to the right of the foreground. The scene unfolds inside a dimly lit indoor basketball gymnasium with a high, arched ceiling made of dark wood. Rows of long, rectangular fluorescent lights are mounted along the curved structure, rhythmically dimming to create an atmosphere of alternating light and shadow on the polished wooden floor. As the man jumps from the center, holding an orange basketball in his right hand, he moves diagonally upwards and to the right toward the hoop. The camera, capturing this in slow motion, starts with a smooth, hip-level tracking shot using a level angle as it pans right to follow the player. As he rises through the air, extending his arm to dunk the ball through the net, the camera tilts up, shifting to a low angle. After the dunk, the camera tilts down slightly and zooms in, bringing both him and the hoop into the foreground. Initially, the camera is at the subject's height, but as the subject jumps, the camera is positioned below him. Additional light streams in from the stadium's main entrance located in the left background, enhancing the scene's dynamic ambiance. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",

    "Scene": "The scene unfolds inside a dimly lit indoor basketball gymnasium with a high, arched ceiling made of dark wood. Rows of long, rectangular fluorescent lights are mounted along the curved structure, rhythmically dimming to create an atmosphere of alternating light and shadow on the polished wooden floor. The walls are a plain, light color, and a basketball hoop is positioned at the far end, with another hoop high up in the upper right corner. A man in athletic attire is shown leaping from the ground, dynamically shooting the basketball toward the upper right corner hoop. Additional light streams in from the stadium's main entrance located in the left background, enhancing the scene's dynamic ambiance.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
