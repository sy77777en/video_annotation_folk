  "merged_caption": "The video presents a medium shot capturing multiple subjects in a domestic setting. Initially, a woman with short blonde hair, dressed in a blue and white checkered dress, is positioned in the middle ground, slightly to the right of center. She quickly moves away from the large, cream-colored refrigerator on the right side of the frame in the foreground towards a yellow door in the background. As she reaches and begins to open the door, a woman with a pink headscarf and a light-colored dress enters from the right, partially turning away and moving into the middle ground. A man in a mustard yellow sweater and dark pants then appears from the right side of the frame, positioned in the middle ground, and moves to the left side, revealing a child in a colorful patterned outfit and a red hat near the lower center, interacting with the adults. The camera remains at eye level with a level angle, maintaining deep focus and a large depth of field, and moves forward smoothly with minimal shaking, focusing on the people in the room. In the background, the yellow door opens, revealing another person with short dark hair, wearing a white shirt and dark pants, standing further back in the scene and continuously spinning. A wooden dining table with chairs is visible on the left in the middle ground, contributing to the cozy, domestic setting. The vase with blue and yellow flowers sits in the middle ground, near the center-right, adding a pop of color. The lighting suggests daytime, with natural light filtering through a window, softly illuminating the space. The camera maintains a consistent perspective, focusing on the interactions among the group without significant changes in shot size or position, capturing a moment of activity that enhances the lively, familial ambiance.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
