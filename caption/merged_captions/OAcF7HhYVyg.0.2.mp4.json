  "merged_caption": "A medium full shot centers on a person in a full-body, white, fluffy costume resembling a yeti, complete with a mask featuring a wide-open, snarling mouth with large, sharp teeth, two curved, yellowish horns, and large, yellow-lensed ski goggles. A black harness is strapped over the chest, and white gloves cover their hands. Positioned on a snowboard, they lean into a turn, carving through the powder and kicking up a spray of snow behind them. The scene unfolds on a steep, snow-covered mountain slope under a clear blue sky, with the bright sun visible in the top right. The vast mountain landscape features other snow-covered peaks and rocky outcrops in the background. The camera, held by the subject, captures a low-angle, eye-level point-of-view as they snowboard, maintaining their central position while the background scenery shifts. The footage is in slow motion, with the camera slightly unsteady, exhibiting some shaking and a varying Dutch angle as it rolls while the skier moves downhill. Mild barrel distortion is present, and deep focus keeps the entire snowy landscape in sharp detail. As the person carves down the mountain, their body is angled low to the ground, maintaining balance with one arm extended to the side while holding a selfie stick with the other arm. The camera moves with them, capturing the dynamic motion and the evolving scene as they swiftly descend the slope, kicking up a spray of white powder snow.",

    "Camera": "This slow-motion video is captured from a low angle, eye-level perspective, leading the skier from the front in a selfie-style shot. The camera is slightly unsteady, with some shaking and a varying Dutch angle as it rolls while the skier moves downhill. The footage exhibits mild barrel distortion and uses a deep focus, keeping the entire snowy landscape in sharp detail.",
    "Subject": "A person is shown wearing a full-body, white, fluffy costume resembling a yeti or an abominable snowman. The costume's head features a mask with a wide-open, snarling mouth displaying large, sharp teeth. Two curved, yellowish horns protrude from the sides of the head. The person wears large, yellow-lensed ski goggles over the mask's eye area. A black harness is strapped over the chest of the white suit, and the person is wearing white gloves. They are positioned on a snowboard, leaning into a turn with one arm extended to the side while holding a selfie stick with the other arm.",
    "Motion": "A person in a yeti costume snowboards down a steep, snow-covered mountain under a clear blue sky. Filming from a selfie stick, they lean into a turn, carving through the powder and kicking up a spray of snow behind them. Their body is angled low to the ground as they maintain balance with one arm extended to the side while moving swiftly down the slope.",
    "Scene": "A selfie POV shot captures a person in a white, furry monster costume with horns and ski goggles snowboarding down a steep, snow-covered mountain. The scene takes place during the daytime under a clear, deep blue sky with the bright sun visible in the upper right. The person is moving down the slope, kicking up a spray of white powder snow. In the background, the vast mountain landscape features other snow-covered peaks and rocky outcrops.",
    "Spatial": "A medium full shot centers on a person in a yeti costume in the foreground. Behind them, a vast, snow-covered mountain slope occupies the middle ground and background, with rocky peaks visible in the background on the left and right. A clear blue sky fills the top of the frame, with the sun positioned in the top right. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, capturing a low-angle point-of-view as they snowboard. As the person carves down the mountain, the camera, held by the subject, moves with them, maintaining their central position while the background scenery shifts and the frame rolls as they adjust their posture."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
