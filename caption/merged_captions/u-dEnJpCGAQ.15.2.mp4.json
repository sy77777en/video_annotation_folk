  "merged_caption": "The video features a full shot of a group of lions resting on a reddish-brown surface, visible at the bottom of the frame. In the foreground, a central lioness with a light tan coat and a white underbelly is positioned in the center, with her front paws extended forward. Her head is initially turned to her right, which is the left of the frame, before facing forward. Behind her, three other lionesses with similar tan coats are partially visible, positioned closely together slightly to the left of the center of the frame, creating a sense of cohesion. The camera is at ground level with a level angle, focusing on the lioness in the foreground using a shallow depth of field and remains completely static throughout the scene. The lioness initially turns her head to the left side of the frame, then shifts her gaze directly ahead with a calm expression. The second lioness from the back moves her head slightly, while the third lioness, positioned at the far left of the frame, first turns her head to the right to look back with her ears moving, then straightens her head to face forward towards the left side of the frame. The background is softly blurred, with lush greenery visible, emphasizing the natural setting of a serene outdoor environment, likely a savannah or grassland, during dusk or dawn. The lighting is soft, highlighting the natural colors of the landscape and the lions' coats. The overall atmosphere is peaceful, with no visible movement or disturbances, allowing the viewer to appreciate the quiet beauty of the scene. The lions' relaxed postures and close proximity suggest a sense of calm and unity, with small sprouts scattered around them on the reddish-brown earth.",

    "Subject": "The video features a group of lions resting closely together. The central subject is a lioness with a light tan coat and a white underbelly, lying down with her front paws extended forward. Her ears are perked up, and she initially turns her head to look towards the left side of the frame before turning back to gaze directly ahead with a calm expression. Behind her, partially visible, are three other lionesses, also with similar tan coats. They are positioned closely, suggesting a sense of cohesion and restfulness among the group. The lions are lying on a reddish-brown surface, which contrasts with their fur, highlighting their presence in the scene.",
    "Motion": "The lioness with a light tan coat lies with her front paws extended forward. She initially turns her head to the left side of the frame, then shifts her gaze directly ahead. The other lionesses rest closely together on the reddish-brown surface, occasionally moving their heads. The second lioness from the back moves her head slightly, while the third lioness, positioned at the far left of the frame, first turns her head to the right to look back with her ears moving, then straightens her head to face forward towards the left side of the frame.",
    "Scene": "The video captures a serene outdoor setting in a natural environment, likely a savannah or grassland, during dusk or dawn.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
