  "merged_caption": "A wide shot captures a promenade from a static, approximately eye-level perspective, where a time-lapse video shows a diverse group of pedestrians, including men and women of various ages, walking along a paved path in a park. The path extends from the foreground at the bottom of the frame, through the middle ground in the center, and into the background. Individuals and small groups move in various directions, with some approaching the camera and others receding into the background. The people are dressed in casual attire such as t-shirts, jeans, and jackets in various colors. Notable figures include a man in a blue jacket pushing a wheeled shopping bag, walking away from the viewer. On the right, an older man with light skin, wearing light grey striped clothing with a grey-blue vest, remains seated on a wooden bench, providing a relatively stationary point of reference amidst the moving crowd, though he exhibits slight movement. The background is composed of buildings and lush green trees on the left and right, with a white canopy visible in the center-background. The scene is set on a bright, sunny day, with the path flanked by lush, green trees and a tree with peach-colored blossoms. The entire scene is presented with a strong tilt-shift effect, which blurs the upper and lower portions of the view, giving it a miniaturized look with saturated colors. The tilt-shift effect keeps a horizontal band in focus, blurring the foreground and background for a unique visual experience.",

    "Camera": "This time-lapse video captures people walking in a park from a stationary and stable eye-level camera. The tilt-shift effect keeps a horizontal band in focus, blurring the foreground and background for a unique visual experience.",
    "Subject": "A diverse group of pedestrians, including men and women of various ages, walk along a paved path. The people are dressed in casual attire such as t-shirts, jeans, and jackets in various colors. Throughout the time-lapse sequence, different individuals move through the scene. Notable figures include a man in a blue jacket pushing a wheeled shopping bag, walking away from the viewer. On the right, an older man with light skin, wearing light grey striped clothing with a grey-blue vest, remains seated on a wooden bench, providing a relatively stationary point of reference amidst the moving crowd, though he exhibits slight movement.",
    "Motion": "In a time-lapse sequence, a crowd of people walks along a paved path in a park. Individuals and small groups move in various directions, with some approaching the camera and others receding into the background. On the right, a man sits on a bench, remaining relatively stationary as the stream of pedestrians flows past.",
    "Scene": "A time-lapse video captures a bustling outdoor promenade on a bright, sunny day. The scene is set on a wide, paved walkway where numerous people in casual clothing stroll. The path is flanked by lush, green trees, and in the background, there are low buildings, a white canopy, and a tree with peach-colored blossoms. On the right, a man sits on a wooden bench. The entire scene is presented with a strong tilt-shift effect, which blurs the upper and lower portions of the view, giving it a miniaturized look with saturated colors.",
    "Spatial": "A wide shot captures a promenade from a static, approximately eye-level perspective. A paved path extends from the foreground at the bottom of the frame, through the middle ground in the center, and into the background. A continuous, time-lapsed flow of pedestrians moves along this path in the middle ground, with individuals walking both towards and away from the camera. In the middle ground on the right, a man remains seated on a bench, serving as a relatively stationary element. The background is composed of buildings and lush green trees on the left and right, with a white canopy visible in the center-background."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
