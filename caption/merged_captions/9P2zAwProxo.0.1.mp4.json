  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot, a man with a light-colored beard and mustache is positioned in the center of the frame and in the foreground, seated on a black ski lift chair that occupies the bottom portion of the screen. He is wearing a black ski helmet with large, dark ski goggles pushed up onto the front, a black and white ski jacket with a black vest-like section over a white long-sleeved portion, and black gloves. The camera, positioned at his level, offers an aerial perspective relative to the distant ground, while maintaining an overhead view of the terrain directly beneath. As the ski lift ascends a snow-covered hill, the man looks toward the camera, remaining mostly still with occasional movement in his head. The slightly unsteady camera moves backward and upward, capturing both the man on the lift in the foreground and the sharp, snowy landscape in the background with deep focus. In the middle ground and background, a snow-covered landscape with bare trees and a ski resort stretches across the frame. The background scenery, including rolling hills dotted with bare trees and a ski resort with its buildings visible at the base of the slope, gradually recedes and moves downward from the camera's point of view. Other ski lift towers and cables are also part of the scenery, creating a network across the wintry terrain under an overcast sky. The scene is captured from a selfie POV shot, emphasizing the man's casual posture with one arm resting on the back of the lift chair as he is transported upwards.",

    "Motion": "A man sits on a ski lift and looks toward the camera as the lift ascends a snow-covered hill. He remains mostly still, with occasional movement in his head, while being transported upwards.",
    "Scene": "A selfie POV shot captures a person riding a black ski lift chair as it ascends over a snow-covered landscape under an overcast sky. In the background, rolling hills dotted with bare trees stretch into the distance, with a ski resort and its buildings visible at the base of the slope. Other ski lift towers and cables are also part of the scenery, creating a network across the wintry terrain.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
