  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a woman with short, dark, messy hair, positioned centrally in the middle ground, wearing a light-colored, unbuttoned jacket over a dark t-shirt and light-colored pants. Her arms are extended to her sides as if for balance, and her face, turned towards the viewer, holds an expression of intense focus or alarm. A soldier quickly moves in the foreground towards the right side of the frame, disappearing from view. The scene is set in a dark, outdoor location at night, filled with dense, swirling smoke that obscures the surroundings. A bright, white light source from the left illuminates the haze, creating a strong backlit effect. A large, dark structure with a glowing red light is visible in the background, slightly off-center to the right. The camera, from an eye-level, level angle, smoothly dollies backward, leading the woman as she jumps from a vehicle. Initially, she leans slightly to her right, raising her right hand upward as if to grasp a helicopter, while her left arm hangs down. As she lands, the camera tilts down slightly and then tilts back up to keep her upper body in frame. She opens both arms and jumps down, stumbling forward a few steps before finally straightening up in a forward-leaning stance, looking directly ahead. The focus begins deep and transitions to a shallow depth of field, keeping the approaching woman sharp while the background blurs. As the scene transitions to a medium shot, the framing tightens around her upper body, maintaining her central position while emphasizing her face and upper arms. The swirling smoke fills the background, with a bright light source located in the upper left corner, creating a strong backlit effect. Throughout the video, the spatial dynamics shift from a broader view of the scene to a more intimate focus on the subject, enhancing the sense of urgency in her pose.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
