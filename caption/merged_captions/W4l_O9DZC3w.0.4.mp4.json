  "merged_caption": "This dynamic shot is composed using a tiny planet perspective, which distorts the scene into a spherical mass of interwoven twigs and grass that occupies both the foreground and middle ground of the frame. The camera moves counterclockwise and zooms out, enhancing the visual effect. At the very top of this sphere, positioned slightly to the right of center, a couple is seen in a wide shot. The man and woman remain largely still, sharing multiple kissing movements as they perch on the large nest, with the woman on the left placing her right hand on the man's chest on the right. The light blue sky acts as the background, completely enveloping the central sphere and filling the surrounding space to the edges of the frame. Thin, dry branches from the nest structure radiate outward from the central mass, extending toward the bottom and left of the frame. This video is shot with a noticeable fisheye distortion, creating a tiny planet perspective that makes the camera's height and angle difficult to determine. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping everything sharp. The shot features a slow, smooth camera movement, simultaneously rolling counterclockwise and zooming out from the couple in the nest. Atop the large, spherical nest composed of interwoven dry brown twigs and grass, a man and a woman are kissing. The woman, on the left, has long, reddish-brown hair and a fair complexion. She is wearing a reddish-brown top with green accents and red fishnet stockings. The man, to her right, has dark, curly hair, a darker complexion, and is dressed in a white tank top and blue jeans. They are both perched on the nest, leaning toward the right in an embrace. Above the intricately woven structure, a light blue sky with wispy white clouds is visible.",

    "Scene": "A large, spherical nest constructed from dry, brown twigs and grass is prominently featured in the center of the frame, with some branches extending toward the lower left edges of the image. Above the intricately woven structure, a light blue sky with wispy white clouds is visible. A man and a woman are situated atop the nest, engaged in a kiss.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
