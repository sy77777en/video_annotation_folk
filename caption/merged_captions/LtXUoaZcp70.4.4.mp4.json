  "merged_caption": "A medium shot frames a central blue, porous-textured statue of a man in a military uniform, positioned in the center of the middle ground behind a brown, textured surface. The man is depicted wearing a high-collared jacket with epaulets and has a distinct eyepatch over his left eye, standing with a serious expression and his left hand resting on the surface in front of him. To his right in the middle ground, another similar statue is partially visible. The out-of-focus shoulders of two other statues occupy the bottom left and bottom right of the foreground, framing the central figure. The camera is positioned at the subject's level and performs a smooth dolly-out, moving backward to gradually reveal more of the scene, including a partial head of another figure becoming visible to his left. Initially, the focus appears deep, but as the camera pulls back, the foreground becomes blurry, indicating a shallow depth of field, though the dark, solid black background makes the precise focus plane difficult to determine. The perspective slowly moves backward, focusing on the central character, and the camera slightly widens the frame to reveal more of the figures and the space around them. The blue, porous-textured statues of men in military uniforms remain completely still throughout the video. Portions of four other similarly styled blue figures are visible: one to his left, one to his right, and the out-of-focus shoulders of two others in the foreground, suggesting a group gathering. White overlay text \"[55]\" is positioned at the bottom left of the frame.",

    "Camera": "This is an eye-level, level-angle shot focusing on a blue, porous statue of a man in a military uniform. The camera performs a smooth dolly-out, moving backward to reveal more of the scene. Initially, the focus appears deep, but as the camera pulls back, the foreground becomes blurry, indicating a shallow depth of field, though the dark background makes the precise focus plane difficult to determine.",
    "Subject": "The main subject of the video is a blue, porous-textured statue of a man in a military uniform, positioned centrally behind a table-like surface. The statue has a complex, lattice-like appearance and is rendered entirely in a vibrant blue. The man is depicted wearing a high-collared jacket with epaulets and has a distinct eyepatch over his left eye. He stands with a serious expression, his left hand resting on the surface in front of him. He is surrounded by other figures of a similar style and color. Two such figures are partially visible, one to his left and one to his right, while the out-of-focus shoulders of two others frame the shot from the foreground, suggesting a group gathering.",
    "Motion": "The blue, porous-textured statues of men in military uniforms remain completely still throughout the video. The camera executes a smooth dolly-out, moving backward to gradually reveal more of the scene.",
    "Scene": "In an abstract setting against a solid black background, a central figure rendered in a blue, porous, lattice-like style stands behind a brown, textured surface. This figure depicts a man in a military uniform with an eyepatch. Portions of four other similarly styled blue figures are visible: one to his left, one to his right, and the out-of-focus shoulders of two others in the foreground. The figures themselves are blue, and the perspective slowly moves backward, focusing on the central character. White overlay text \"[55]\" is positioned at the bottom left of the frame.",
    "Spatial": "A medium shot frames a central blue statue of a man in a military uniform, positioned in the center of the middle ground behind a brown surface. To his right in the middle ground, another similar statue is partially visible. The out-of-focus shoulders of two other statues occupy the bottom left and bottom right of the foreground, framing the central figure. The camera is positioned at the subject's level and slowly pulls back, slightly widening the frame to reveal more of the figures and the space around them, including a partial head of another figure becoming visible to his left."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
