  "merged_caption": "In a full shot, a man dressed in full paintball gear kneels in the center-right of the frame, positioned in the middle ground on a green grass field under a clear blue sky. He wears a black long-sleeved jersey with white graphics and the word \"MEDIA\" visible in white on the back, paired with black pants that have white lettering down the side. His entire head and face are covered by a black protective mask with a visor. He holds a paintball marker that is primarily black with a lime green barrel and accents, a black hopper on top, and a green air tank attached to the back. To his left, a large, inflatable bunker composed of blue and red sections occupies the left side of the frame, also in the middle ground, while a tall, black safety net stretches across the background. In the distance, a smaller, cylindrical bunker also made up of red and blue sections is visible. The man maintains a low, kneeling stance, aiming the marker forward as he peeks around the side of the bunker. He then shifts his body to the left, moving behind the bunker, before repositioning himself. The camera, filmed from a hip-level, level angle, smoothly pans from right to left and tilts slightly down to follow the paintball player, tracking his movements as he moves slightly forward, which is to the left of the frame, approaching the blue bunker while maintaining his low posture. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp, and remains at the subject's level throughout the shot.",

    "Motion": "A person in paintball gear, kneeling on the grass, aims their marker around the left side of a large blue inflatable bunker. They then shift their body to the left, moving behind the bunker, before repositioning themselves.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set on an outdoor paintball field under a clear blue sky during the day. The ground is covered in vibrant green grass. A large, inflatable bunker composed of blue and red sections stands on the left, while a tall, black safety net encloses the area in the background. In the distance, a smaller, cylindrical bunker also made up of red and blue sections is visible. A person wearing black protective gear, including a mask and a harness, kneels on the grass beside the blue and red bunker, holding a lime green and black paintball marker.",
    "Spatial": "In a full shot, a man in paintball gear kneels in the center-right of the frame, positioned in the middle ground on a green grass field. To his left, a large blue inflatable bunker occupies the left side of the frame, also in the middle ground, while a black safety net stretches across the background. The man moves slightly forward, which is to the left of the frame, approaching the blue bunker while maintaining his low posture. The camera tracks the man, slightly panning to the left and tilting downward, remaining at the subject's level throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
