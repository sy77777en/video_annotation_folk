  "merged_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a red sports car prominently drifting along a winding desert road. Initially, the car is positioned at the center of the frame, with the road curving away into the background. The car occupies a significant portion of the frame, allowing a clear view of its dynamic movement. As the video progresses, the car drifts sharply, moving to the right-center of the frame, then shifts to the left-center, and finally returns to the center, kicking up a dense cloud of white smoke from its rear tires due to high-speed motion and tire friction. This transition emphasizes the car's speed and agility. The surrounding environment, consisting of arid terrain and sparse vegetation, remains in the background throughout the video, providing a stark contrast to the smooth road. The video, captured from a drone POV, features a drone camera at an overhead level, initially following the car from above and behind, advancing forward while panning left and trucking right. Once it reaches a position above and to the side of the car, it moves backward to continue tracking the car. During this movement, a rolling motion creates a varying Dutch angle. The camera maintains deep focus with a large depth of field, and the movement is visually dynamic and smooth, with no shaking, providing a pleasing aerial view of the drifting car. The environment is arid, with sparse vegetation and sandy terrain surrounding the asphalt. The time of day appears to be midday, with clear skies and bright sunlight casting sharp shadows. The car is sleek and aerodynamic, with visible decals and a spoiler on the back, enhancing the sense of speed and agility as it maneuvers through the curves.",

    "Subject": "The video features a red sports car prominently drifting on a winding desert road. The car is sleek and aerodynamic, with visible decals and a spoiler on the back. It emits a thick cloud of white smoke from its tires, indicating high-speed motion and sharp turns. The road is surrounded by arid, sandy terrain with sparse vegetation, enhancing the sense of speed and agility as the car maneuvers through the curves. The car's dynamic movement and the smoke trail are central to the scene, emphasizing the action and skill involved in the driving.",
    "Motion": "The video shows a red sports car drifting along a winding road. It navigates a sharp curve, with white smoke billowing from its rear tires due to high-speed motion and tire friction. The car maintains a dynamic movement as it continues around the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility.",
    "Scene": "The video, captured from a drone POV, showcases a dynamic scene set on a winding desert road. The environment is arid, with sparse vegetation and sandy terrain surrounding the asphalt. The time of day appears to be midday, with clear skies and bright sunlight casting sharp shadows. A red car is prominently featured, drifting around the curves of the road, creating plumes of smoke that trail behind it. The motion of the car and the dust it kicks up emphasize the speed and agility of the vehicle as it navigates the barren landscape. The drone's perspective provides a sweeping view of the scene, highlighting the contrast between the smooth road and the rugged desert backdrop.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
