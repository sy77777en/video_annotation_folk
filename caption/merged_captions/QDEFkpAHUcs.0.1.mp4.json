  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a long, straight line of men dressed in historical military uniforms, arranged horizontally from the left foreground to the right background. Each man wears a tall, black, furry hat, likely a bearskin, secured under his chin with a gold, scaled chin strap. Their uniforms feature red coats with white crossbelts and dark, high collars, adorned with a white, star-shaped insignia. The soldiers hold the butts of their rifles, resting them against their shoulders in the \"shoulder arms\" stance. Initially, the focus is on the soldiers in the middle ground, while the soldier in the immediate left foreground is out of focus. The scene is set outdoors in a stone courtyard, with the stone facade of a large building visible in the right background. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, captures this eye-level, level-angle shot with a shallow depth of field. As the camera smoothly moves to the right, it performs a slow rack focus, transitioning the focus from the soldiers in the midground to those further down the line in the background, gradually revealing the full extent of the formation. The soldiers remain completely still, standing at attention in a straight line. The shot then transitions to a medium shot, and in the final framing, the line of soldiers continues to occupy the horizontal space, with the stone building becoming more prominent in the background.",

    "Subject": "A long, straight line of men dressed in historical military uniforms stands at attention in profile, all facing to the right. Each man wears a tall, black, furry hat, likely a bearskin, which is secured under his chin with a gold, scaled chin strap. Their uniforms feature red coats with white crossbelts and dark, high collars. A white, star-shaped insignia is visible on the collars of all the soldiers. The men hold the butts of their rifles and rest them against their shoulders in the \"shoulder arms\" stance, and the line extends from the close-up foreground deep into the background.",

    "Scene": "The scene is set outdoors in a stone courtyard, where a long line of soldiers stands in formation, viewed from the side. The soldiers wear uniforms featuring tall, black, furry hats, red coats with white crossbelts, and decorative gold-colored chin straps. In the background, the stone facade of a large building is visible. The camera's focus shifts from the soldiers in the close middleground down the length of the line, gradually revealing the extent of the formation.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a line of soldiers arranged horizontally from the left foreground to the right background. Initially, the focus is on the soldiers in the middle ground, while the soldier in the immediate left foreground is out of focus. The shot then transitions to a medium shot as the camera moves to the right, using rack focus to shift attention from the middle ground to the background, revealing the full extent of the formation. In the final framing, the line of soldiers continues to occupy the horizontal space, and a stone building becomes visible in the right background. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level throughout the scene."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
