  "merged_caption": "A full, low-angle shot initially frames a young male diver, wearing blue swim trunks, in the top-right center of the scene, mid-air, with his back facing the camera. The scene is set in an indoor natatorium during a diving event, with a white wall on the left and a red, white, and blue banner for the \"U.S. OLYMPIC TEAM TRIALS\" on the right. The camera tilts and pedestals downward at a slow speed as the diver transitions from a tucked position into a straight, vertical handstand pose, rotating his body to face the camera with his chest and face. His legs remain straight throughout the dive, and his hair is short and light-colored. The diving platform, marked with \"IUPUI\" and \"INDIANAPOLIS,\" comes into the middle ground, where a cameraman is visible on the left. The camera follows the diver's descent toward the bottom center, capturing his entry into the clear blue water hands-first, creating a splash. The view then cuts to a level-angle underwater shot, showing the diver submerged at the bottom of the frame amidst a cloud of bubbles against the blue-tiled pool floor. The video continues to capture a brief moment of him submerged, highlighting his athletic form and the precision of his dive. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp throughout the shot.",

    "Camera": "This slow-motion video begins with a low-angle shot looking up at a diver. The camera tilts and pedestals downward at a slow speed as he executes his dive. It follows him into the water, transitioning from an above-water to an underwater perspective and shifting from a low to a level angle. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp throughout the shot.",
    "Subject": "The video features a young male diver, wearing blue swim trunks, performing a dive. He is seen mid-air, starting with his back facing the camera, then flipping to rotate his body and face the camera with his chest and face. His legs remain straight throughout the dive, and his hair is short and light-colored. The dive concludes with him entering the water, creating a splash, and the video continues to capture a brief moment of him submerged beneath the surface, highlighting his athletic form and the precision of his dive.",
    "Motion": "A male diver, already in mid-air, transitions from a tucked position into a straight, vertical handstand pose. He holds this form as he descends, entering the water hands-first with a splash. The view then shifts to an underwater perspective, showing the diver submerged amidst a cloud of bubbles.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set in an indoor natatorium during a diving event. A diver performs a dive from a height above the white platform marked with the words \"IUPUI\" and \"INDIANAPOLIS\" in black background and white text. In the background, a large white wall displays a list of names, and a prominent red, white, and blue banner for the \"U.S. OLYMPIC TEAM TRIALS\" hangs nearby, featuring the Olympic rings and logos for USA Diving and NBC Sports. The camera follows the diver's descent, culminating in a splash in the clear blue water. The view then shifts to an underwater perspective, showing the diver submerged amidst a cloud of bubbles against the blue-tiled pool floor.",
    "Spatial": "A full, low-angle shot initially frames the diver in the top-right center of the scene, mid-air. In the background, a white wall is on the left, and a red banner is on the right. The camera tilts downward to follow the diver as he descends toward the bottom center, bringing the diving platform into the middle ground, where a cameraman is also visible on the left. After the diver enters the water at the bottom center, the view cuts to a level-angle underwater shot, showing the diver submerged at the bottom of the frame against the background of the blue-tiled pool."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
