  "merged_caption": "From a first-person perspective framed by a dark red helmet visor at the periphery, the camera glides smoothly forward through a dense, dark, underwater alien forest at a level angle. The sandy seabed occupies the bottom of the frame, and occasionally, two gloved hands in an orange and black suit enter the frame from the bottom center in the immediate foreground. The scene is filled with towering, trunk-like structures resembling giant mushrooms, featuring porous grey trunks and large, flat, reddish-brown caps. Bright green, peanut-shaped growths cling to the trunks, illuminating the environment with bioluminescence. Schools of small, dark, fish-like creatures with glowing purple and green outlines swim throughout the area, moving in various directions around the structures. Smaller, glowing blue, ribbon-like creatures drift and swim in the teal-colored water. From the middle ground to the background, the scene is dominated by these tall, vertical structures that extend from the bottom to the top of the frame, positioned across the scene from left to right. Occasionally, the camera navigates between these central structures, bringing them into the foreground before they pass by and exit the frame on either side. In the background, more of these structures recede into the murky depths, with a large, dark, arch-like plant visible in the distance. The camera's viewpoint is positioned below the flat caps of the tall structures, creating a slightly upward-looking angle. The movement includes intermittent downward shifts and concludes with a slight pan to the right. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire alien-like seascape in sharp detail. A text overlay in the bottom left corner reads \"Loopy Longplays.\"",

    "Subject": "This video shows a first-person, underwater perspective of a bioluminescent alien forest. The scene is filled with tall, dark, trunk-like structures that have a porous texture and are adorned with glowing green, peanut-shaped organisms. These trunks support numerous flat, disc-shaped caps that are reddish-orange on top and have a lighter, honeycomb-like texture on their undersides. A large school of small, dark, fish-like creatures with glowing purple and green outlines swims throughout the environment. In the background, a very large, dark, bridge-like plant structure is situated between the mushroom trees. Other small life forms are visible, including glowing blue, ribbon-like creatures that float freely and pink rings attached to the trunks of some mushroom trees. The view is framed by the dark red border of a helmet or viewport, and occasionally, two gloved hands in an orange and black suit appear at the bottom of the screen.",
    "Motion": "The first-person perspective moves forward through an underwater alien forest, navigating between tall, trunk-like structures. Some schools of small, fish-like creatures with glowing outlines swim throughout the scene, moving in various directions around the structures. Smaller, glowing blue, ribbon-like creatures are also seen drifting and swimming in the water. As the viewpoint advances, two gloved hands occasionally appear at the bottom of the frame.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves through a dark, underwater alien forest. The environment is filled with towering, stalk-like structures that resemble giant mushrooms, featuring porous grey trunks and large, flat, reddish-brown caps. The scene is illuminated by various forms of bioluminescence: bright green, peanut-shaped growths cling to the trunks, schools of small fish with glowing purple and green bodies swim throughout the area, and glowing blue, ribbon-like creatures drift in the teal-colored water. The perspective glides forward through the sandy seabed, navigating between the massive stalks. The entire view is framed by a dark red border, suggesting a helmet's visor. A text overlay in the bottom left corner reads \"Loopy Longplays.\"",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
