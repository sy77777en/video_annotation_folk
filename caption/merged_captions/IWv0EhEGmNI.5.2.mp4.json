  "merged_caption": "From a first-person perspective, a rifle is held in the bottom-center foreground, maintaining a relatively fixed position within the frame. The scene initially frames a large column on the left in the middle ground, with a walkway extending into the center. The video opens with a smooth, eye-level first-person perspective, maintaining a level angle and deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. The camera starts by trucking right and briefly panning in the same direction to navigate past a pillar. It then continues moving rightward with a slight left pan. As it advances along the stone path next to the building, the view subtly advances forward and swiftly pans left to focus on the house. The building with its columns occupies the left side of the frame, while dense bushes on the right remain in the middle ground. The entire scene is rendered in a green-tinted night vision mode. The character's hands are covered in light-colored gloves, and the rifle is equipped with a holographic sight. Various heads-up display elements are positioned around the screen: a compass is at the top-center, an objective marker is on the left indicating 'Search Church' at a distance of 114 meters, and a primary objective stating 'Find Hadir' is in the top-center. A \"Checkpoint reached\" notification briefly appears in the top-left. The camera maintains a character's eye-level height throughout the sequence.",

    "Subject": "A first-person perspective from a video game shows a player character holding a modern assault rifle equipped with a holographic sight. The character's hands are covered in light-colored gloves. The entire scene is rendered in a green-tinted night vision mode. On-screen text displays the objective \"Find Hadir.\" A waypoint marker on the left indicates a location named \"Search Church\" at a distance of 114 meters. A compass is visible at the top of the screen, and a \"Checkpoint reached\" notification appears briefly.",
    "Motion": "The video offers a smooth, eye-level first-person perspective. Initially, the view shifts to the right while briefly panning in the same direction to navigate past a large pillar. It then continues moving rightward with a slight leftward pan. As it progresses along the stone path next to the building, the view subtly advances forward and swiftly pans left to focus on the house.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves through a dark, outdoor location at night, with the entire scene cast in a monochromatic green hue from a night vision perspective. The camera proceeds along a stone walkway that runs alongside a large building featuring prominent columns and windows. To the right of the path are dense bushes and trees. The character's gloved hands and a rifle with a sight are visible at the bottom of the view. Several heads-up display elements are overlaid on the screen, including a compass at the top, an objective marker on the left indicating 'Search Church' at a distance, and a primary objective stating 'Find Hadir.' A 'Checkpoint reached' notification briefly appears.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
