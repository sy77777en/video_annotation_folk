  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a medium close-up of a Black man positioned in the center foreground, lying on his back in a very dark, outdoor setting at night. He is wearing a dark-colored coat with a white inner lining and a fur-lined hood over a t-shirt with prominent text on the front, with stripes as a secondary detail. A gold chain is visible around his neck. The camera is positioned at a high angle, focusing on him with a shallow depth of field that keeps him sharp. The camera smoothly cranes up in an arc and slowly pushes in, transitioning to a close-up that frames his face in the center of the shot. He holds a lit cigarette or joint to his lips, its red, glowing tip providing a small point of light in the otherwise dark environment. This faint light casts a warm glow on his face and the front of his coat. His head and eyes make subtle movements as he looks upward. Additionally, another light source off-camera intermittently sweeps between the ground and his face, adding brief moments of illumination to the scene. The surrounding area is completely dark, with the only visible elements being the man in the foreground.",

    "Camera": "From a high angle, the camera is positioned at ground level, focusing on a person lying down. With a shallow depth of field that keeps the person sharp, the camera smoothly cranes up in an arc.",
    "Subject": "A Black man is shown from a high-angle, overhead perspective, lying on his back in a very dark setting. He is wearing a dark-colored coat with a white inner lining and a fur-lined hood over a t-shirt with prominent text on the front, with stripes as a secondary detail. A gold chain is visible around his neck. He holds a lit cigarette or joint to his lips, its red, glowing tip providing a small point of light in the otherwise dark environment. His face is partially illuminated by this light, and he appears to be looking upwards.",
    "Motion": "The camera slowly zooms in on the man's face as he lies on his back in a dark setting. He holds a lit cigarette to his lips, and his head and eyes make subtle movements as he looks upward.",
    "Scene": "From an overhead perspective, a person lies on their back in a dark, outdoor setting at night. They wear a dark coat with a white inner lining visible near their shoulder. The scene is almost entirely engulfed in shadow, with illumination coming from a cigarette with a glowing red tip held near the person's mouth. This faint light casts a warm glow on their face and the front of their coat. Additionally, another light source off-camera intermittently sweeps between the ground and the person's face, adding brief moments of illumination to the scene.",
    "Spatial": "The video starts with a medium close-up of a person positioned in the center foreground. The person is lying on their back, and the camera slowly pushes in, transitioning to a close-up that frames their face in the center of the shot. The surrounding area is completely dark, with the only visible elements being the person in the foreground."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
