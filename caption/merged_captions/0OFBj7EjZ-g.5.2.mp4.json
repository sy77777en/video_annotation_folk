  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a large cylindrical structure with a smooth, reflective glass surface and a grid-like pattern, occupying most of the frame. This structure is centrally positioned in the foreground, surrounded by multiple rectangular windows on either side, forming part of a light-colored building. These windows are symmetrically arranged and extend into the background. As the video progresses, the camera smoothly zooms out while tilting up, transitioning to a medium shot that reveals more of the surrounding environment. The cylindrical structure remains the central focus, with the windows lining the left and right edges, emphasizing the building's symmetrical layout. The camera maintains a level angle with deep focus, capturing the scene with minimal shaking. The large green tarp partially covering the cylinder is consistently visible in the upper portion of the frame, indicating ongoing construction or renovation. The overcast lighting is diffused and soft, with no direct sunlight visible. The scene is captured from an objective point of view, providing a detached, observational perspective. The video provides a broader view of the urban setting, highlighting the relationship between the cylindrical structure and the adjacent modern buildings with white exteriors. The overall spatial framing maintains a balanced composition, with the cylinder as the primary focal point and the surrounding windows adding depth to the scene. In the bottom left corner, text reads: \"[7,21] ; DER SPIEGEL - Giant Aquarium Burst - This is How the AquaDom Was Built | SPIEGEL TV (2022),\" providing context about the building's significance.",

    "Camera": "The video features a level camera angle with deep focus, maintaining clarity across the scene. The camera smoothly zooms out while tilting up, capturing the building's facade with minimal shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video features a large cylindrical structure with a smooth, reflective glass surface, resembling a modern facade. This structure is central and prominent, surrounded by multiple rectangular windows set in a white or light-colored building, suggesting a modern architectural design. The structure appears to be part of a larger building complex, with the windows arranged in a symmetrical pattern. The overall scene conveys a sense of urban architecture with a focus on the distinctive cylindrical element.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a close-up view of a large cylindrical structure with a grid-like pattern on its surface, situated in the center of a building with multiple windows. As the camera zooms out, more of the cylindrical structure and its surroundings become visible, revealing the building's symmetrical layout and the consistent arrangement of windows. The zooming out continues, providing a wider view of the structure and the building, emphasizing the cylindrical structure's central position and the uniformity of the architectural design.",
    "Scene": "The video shows an outdoor urban setting featuring a tall cylindrical building with a green glass facade, surrounded by modern buildings with white exteriors and numerous windows, creating a cityscape. The overcast lighting is diffused and soft, with no direct sunlight visible. A large green tarp partially covers the cylindrical building, indicating construction or renovation work. The scene is captured from an objective point of view, providing a detached, observational perspective. In the bottom left corner, text reads: \"[7,21] ; DER SPIEGEL - Giant Aquarium Burst - This is How the AquaDom Was Built | SPIEGEL TV (2022),\" providing context about the building's significance.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a large cylindrical structure, which occupies most of the frame. This structure is centrally positioned and is in the foreground of the scene. Surrounding the cylinder, multiple rectangular windows are visible on either side, forming part of a light-colored building. These windows are symmetrically arranged and occupy the left and right sides of the frame, extending into the background. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to a medium shot, revealing more of the surrounding environment while maintaining the cylindrical structure as the central focus. The cylinder remains in the center of the frame throughout, with the windows continuing to line the left and right edges. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, capturing the scene horizontally. There are no significant changes in the spatial position of the elements; however, the transition from close-up to medium shot provides a broader view of the urban setting, emphasizing the relationship between the cylindrical structure and the adjacent buildings. The large green tarp covering parts of the cylinder is consistently visible in the upper portion of the frame, indicating ongoing construction or renovation. The overall spatial framing maintains a balanced composition, with the cylinder as the primary focal point and the surrounding windows adding depth to the scene."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
