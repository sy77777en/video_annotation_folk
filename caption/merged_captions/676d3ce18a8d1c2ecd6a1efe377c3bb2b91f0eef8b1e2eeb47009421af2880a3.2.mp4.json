  "merged_caption": "This extreme wide shot captures a rural landscape from a high aerial perspective, featuring a stone church with a spire positioned slightly left of center, occupying the middle ground. A graveyard surrounds the church, primarily visible in the bottom left quadrant and extending towards the center bottom, situated in the foreground and middle ground. A path leads from the bottom left corner towards the church in the middle ground. Clusters of green trees are located in the top left, top center, and bottom right areas, spanning the middle ground and background. A large, golden-brown field dominates the top right and right side of the frame, extending into the background. The camera, at an aerial level and high angle, smoothly performs a counterclockwise arc around the church, transitioning to a trucking motion to the right at the end. The video, filmed by a drone, captures the historic stone church with its tall spire, surrounded by a mix of green trees and a golden-brown field, indicating a late summer or early autumn time of day. The church is centrally positioned, with a graveyard visible around it, marked by scattered headstones. The architecture of the church is characterized by its gray stone material and traditional design. The scene is bathed in natural daylight, highlighting the textures of the stone and the patterns in the harvested field. The drone's perspective provides a comprehensive view of the church and its surroundings, emphasizing the contrast between the structured architecture and the organic landscape. The camera employs deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping all elements sharp, and gradually moves to provide a comprehensive view of the church and its surroundings, emphasizing the harmony between human-made structures and nature.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
