  "merged_caption": "This close-up shot begins with a silver, five-spoke alloy wheel in the foreground, positioned in the right and center of the frame, featuring a Mercedes-Benz logo in the center cap and \"AMG\" lettering on one of the thick, slightly angular spokes. The black rubber tire has visible sidewall lettering, including \"CONTINENTAL,\" and a silver brake disc with a darker brake caliper can be seen behind the wheel spokes. To the left, in the middle ground, the black car body and an open rear passenger door are visible, revealing a tan leather seat and a sunroof at the top left. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, moves smoothly forward and to the left, with a slight upward movement at the end, causing the wheel to shift to the far-right edge of the frame. This motion shifts the view from the wheel to the open rear passenger door, transitioning the focus to the car's interior, bringing the open doorway and the tan seat back to the center and left of the frame in the middle ground. The rear passenger door is open, revealing a tan leather interior, specifically the back of a front seat which has a storage pocket. Part of the car's roof, including a sunroof, is also visible. The shot maintains a shallow depth of field, with the focus on the wheel in the foreground, and the scene is set outdoors on an asphalt surface during the day.",

    "Camera": "From a level angle, ground-level, the camera moves smoothly forward and to the left, with a slight upward movement at the end, transitioning from a close-up of the car's wheel toward the open passenger door. The shot maintains a shallow depth of field, with the focus on the wheel in the foreground.",
    "Subject": "The video shows a close-up of the rear passenger side of a black car with a glossy finish. The rear passenger door is open, revealing a tan leather interior, specifically the back of a front seat which has a storage pocket. A large, silver, five-spoke alloy wheel is prominently featured, with a Mercedes-Benz logo in the center cap and \"AMG\" lettering visible on one of the thick, slightly angular spokes. The black rubber tire has visible sidewall lettering, including \"CONTINENTAL,\" and a silver brake disc with a darker brake caliper can be seen behind the wheel spokes. Part of the car's roof, including a sunroof, is also visible.",
    "Motion": "From a level-angle perspective focused on a stationary car's rear wheel, the camera moves forward and to the left with a slight upward movement. This motion shifts the view from the wheel to the open rear passenger door, revealing the car's interior.",
    "Scene": "The video begins with a close-up of the rear wheel, showcasing a silver, five-spoke alloy rim with a Mercedes-Benz center cap on a black tire. As the camera slowly pushes in, the focus transitions smoothly to the car's interior through the open rear passenger door, revealing the tan leather seats, the back of a front seat with a storage pocket, and a sunroof in the ceiling, all set outdoors on an asphalt surface during the day.",
    "Spatial": "This close-up shot begins with a silver car wheel in the foreground, positioned in the right and center of the frame. To the left, in the middle ground, the black car body and an open rear door are visible, revealing a tan leather seat and a sunroof at the top left. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, slowly trucks left and pushes in, causing the wheel to shift to the far-right edge of the frame. This movement transitions the focus to the car's interior, bringing the open doorway and the tan seat back to the center and left of the frame in the middle ground."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
