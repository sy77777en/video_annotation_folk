  "merged_caption": "A close-up shot frames a lizard's head, which is positioned in the center of the frame and occupies the foreground. The lizard faces the camera directly, with its head centered and eyes looking forward. The background is out of focus, creating a shallow depth of field with muted, earthy tones suggesting a natural, outdoor environment during the day. The camera remains static and is positioned at the lizard's eye level throughout the shot. Initially, the lizard tilts its head and body slightly to the left before straightening them somewhat, then remains completely still, staring directly forward without any discernible movement. The lighting highlights the intricate, bumpy texture of the lizard's skin, particularly on its snout and prominent brow ridges. Its skin is covered in small, rough scales, exhibiting a mottled pattern of gray, brown, and possibly some greenish hues. The scales on its chin and neck are lighter, appearing almost white or very light gray with darker speckles, while the scales on the top of its head are a more uniform brownish-gray. The lizard has dark, round pupils set within lighter irises. Its head is somewhat triangular from this frontal view, with a noticeable V-shaped ridge or crest running from between its eyes towards the back of its head, and pronounced brow ridges above the eyes. The scales around its chin and neck appear slightly raised or spiky. This static, level-angle shot features an extremely shallow depth of field, with the focus sharply on the lizard in the foreground.",

    "Scene": "A close-up, head-on view shows a lizard with textured, gray and brown scales. The creature's head is centered, with its eyes looking forward.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
