  "merged_caption": "This wide shot captures a scenery view of a narrow European street from a low-angle perspective. The scene is framed with several vehicles acting as compositional elements. In the foreground, the rear of a black SUV occupies the bottom left, and the rear of a white car is in the bottom right. The street extends from the bottom center into the background, flanked by parked cars in the middle ground—a white car and a red car on the left, and a grey sedan and white van on the right. Grand, historic buildings line both sides of the street, extending from the middle ground into the background, where another large building is centered at the far end. A red watermark with the white text \"THE STRADMAN\" is positioned in the bottom right corner. From an unsteady, eye-level perspective, the camera moves slowly forward down the street, maintaining a level angle and a deep focus, keeping the parked cars and buildings on both sides of the road sharp. The shot captures the overall environment and atmosphere, focusing on the character and scale of the opulent urban setting. The narrow road is lined with grand, historic buildings with ornate stone facades and rows of windows, creating an atmosphere of affluence and architectural heritage. Green, leafy trees are visible between the buildings, and a black, ornate lamppost stands on the right sidewalk. The lighting is soft under an overcast sky, enhancing the classical architecture of the multi-story stone buildings. The perspective moves slowly forward along the street, capturing the luxurious ambiance of the cityscape, likely in a major European city such as London.",

    "Motion": "This is a point-of-view shot from a handheld camera moving slowly down a street in what appears to be a major European city, likely London.

    "Scene": "From a first-person POV, as if through the character’s eyes, the scene unfolds on a narrow street in a European city, flanked by grand, multi-story stone buildings with classical architecture. The lighting is soft under an overcast sky. The asphalt road is marked with white lines for parallel parking, where the rear half of a black SUV and a red sports car are visible on the left, and the rear half of a white car, a dark gray sedan, and a white van are on the right. Green, leafy trees are visible between the buildings, and a black, ornate lamppost stands on the right sidewalk. The perspective moves slowly forward along the street. A red watermark with the white text \"THE STRADMAN\" is positioned in the bottom right corner as an overlay.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
