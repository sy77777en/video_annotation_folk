  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a level-angle, wide shot of an urban alley, featuring a teenage boy on a skateboard positioned next to a large green dumpster in the left middle ground. A black car is parked in the right middle ground, and as the camera, shot with a fisheye lens, smoothly pans right while tilting up and then down, it shifts to the left middle ground, revealing a white car further back in the center middle ground. The alley is flanked by red brick buildings, one of which features a yellow-painted door frame, and a wooden fence runs along the right side. A network of utility poles and overhead wires crisscrosses the bright sky above. As the skateboarder rolls from the left side of the alley toward the center, his size gradually increases, transitioning to a full shot. The camera, initially static with a level angle, tracks the skateboarder as he approaches a curb, jumps into the air, and the skateboard flips beneath his feet. The camera briefly incorporates a varying Dutch angle before returning to a level angle. The skateboarder lands back on the skateboard in the right middle ground, almost colliding with the wooden fence on the right side of the frame, and continues skating away along the right side of the alley. His upper body exits the frame, resulting in a medium shot. The shot returns to a wide shot as he becomes a small figure in the right background. Throughout the video, the shot size remains constant, with the skateboarder's changing distance from the camera creating the perception of different shot sizes. The camera becomes static again after the skateboarder lands, maintaining a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp.",

    "Camera": "Shot with a fisheye lens, the video exhibits noticeable distortion, curving straight lines outward. The camera is positioned at ground level with a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp. Initially static with a level angle, the camera smoothly pans right while tilting up and then down to track a skateboarder as they approach and jump. The camera, which briefly incorporates a varying Dutch angle, returns to a level angle  and becomes static again after the skateboarder lands.",
    "Subject": "The video primarily highlights a teenage boy skateboarding from the left to the right side of the frame. As the video progresses, the boy performs a trick by jumping over the curb and continues moving toward the far right of the frame. In the middle ground, two stationary cars—one black and one white—are visible, but the emphasis remains on the teenager's dynamic motion rather than the parked vehicles.",
    "Motion": "A person on a skateboard rolls from the left side of an alley toward the center. As they approach a curb, they jump into the air, and the skateboard flips beneath their feet. The person lands back on the skateboard and continues skating, almost colliding with the wooden fence on the right side of the frame.",
    "Scene": "An objective, low-angle shot captures a paved urban alleyway during the day under an overcast sky. The alley is flanked by red brick buildings, one of which features a yellow-painted door frame. A large green dumpster and a dark sedan, which appears more black than blue, are positioned on the left side of the alley, while a white sedan is parked further down. A wooden fence runs along the right side, and a network of utility poles and overhead wires crisscrosses the bright sky above.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a level-angle, wide shot of an urban alley, featuring a skateboarder positioned next to a large green dumpster in the left middle ground. A black car is parked in the right middle ground, and as the camera pans right, it shifts to the left middle ground, revealing a white car further back in the center middle ground. As the skateboarder moves toward the camera, his size gradually increases, transitioning to a full shot. He jumps over the foreground curb, and his upper body exits the frame, resulting in a medium shot. After landing in the right middle ground, he skates away along the right side of the alley, and the shot returns to a wide shot as he becomes a small figure in the right background. Throughout the video, the shot size remains constant, with the skateboarder's changing distance from the camera creating the perception of different shot sizes."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
