  "merged_caption": "Initially, a medium shot frames the scene at the subjects' level, with a person in a white robe-like garment with a large, dark blue graphic on the back occupying the left-foreground, seen from behind. This person, who has light brown, shoulder-length hair, holds a child with dark, possibly dreadlocked hair, wearing a green short-sleeved shirt with a yellow graphic on the front, positioned in the center-middle ground. A man with dark skin and a shaved head, dressed in a red long-sleeved shirt, stands to the right in the middle ground, observing the scene. The indoor environment features a prominent black and white checkered tile floor, transparent chairs, and a small, clear table, all presented with a grainy, low-fidelity aesthetic and a distinct greenish color cast, reminiscent of old analog footage. The camera begins with an unsteady, hip-level angle before craning upward in an arc, transitioning to a bird's eye view. As the person in the white robe holds the child and turns slightly, the camera shifts to look directly down upon the checkered pattern of the floor. In this final composition, the person in the white robe is at the bottom of the frame in the foreground, the child is in the foreground and middle ground, and the man in red spans both the foreground and middle ground. This movement makes the black and white checkered floor a dominant element in the background, also revealing a small, clear table in the center-bottom middle ground. The entire video is framed by black vertical bars on the left and right sides, maintaining a deep focus with a large depth of field throughout.",

    "Camera": "This unsteady shot begins at a hip-level, level angle before craning upward in an arc. This movement transitions the camera to an eye-level, bird's-eye view of the people below. The shot maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field throughout.",
    "Subject": "A person with light brown, shoulder-length hair, seen mostly from behind, wears a white robe-like garment with a large, dark blue graphic on the back. This individual is holding a child who has dark, possibly dreadlocked hair and is wearing a green short-sleeved shirt with a yellow graphic on the front. Standing nearby is a man with dark skin and a shaved head, who is dressed in a red long-sleeved shirt and is looking forward.",
    "Motion": "A person in a white robe holds a child and turns slightly. The camera then shifts to a bird's eye top-down angle view, looking down as the person holds the child over a small, round table on a black-and-white checkered floor. A man in a red shirt stands nearby, observing the scene.",
    "Scene": "An indoor scene is characterized by a prominent black and white checkered tile floor. The space is furnished with transparent chairs and a small, clear table. The entire video is presented with a grainy, low-fidelity aesthetic, featuring a distinct greenish color cast and soft focus, reminiscent of old analog footage. The camera's perspective shifts during the clip, moving from a medium shot to a bird's eye top-down angle view that looks directly down upon the checkered pattern of the floor. The scene is framed by black vertical bars on the left and right sides.",
    "Spatial": "Initially, a medium shot frames the scene at the subjects' level, with a person in a white robe occupying the left-foreground, seen from behind.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
