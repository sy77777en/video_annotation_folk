  "merged_caption": "The video maintains a wide shot with the camera positioned at the subjects' level, beginning at hip level with a slightly low angle. Initially, Tom, a cartoon cat with blue-grey fur, white paws, muzzle, and belly, and yellow eyes, is in the left middle ground, lunging from a light-colored, tufted sofa located in the center foreground, which has two cushions. Jerry, a small cartoon mouse with brown fur, a lighter brown belly and muzzle, and large ears, is positioned in the center middle ground, jumping away. As Tom chases Jerry, he moves in and out of the foreground, middle ground, and background. After Tom's first jump from behind the sofa, feathers begin to float in the air, hinting at the chaos of the chase. The camera pans slightly left before transitioning to a rightward pan and moving to a level angle, tracking Tom as he moves to a grey stool in the center middle ground, while Jerry repositions to a desk in the center middle ground. The television, displaying a black and white close-up image of a man's face, is now in the center background. The camera tilts upward to track Tom leaping from the stool towards the television, where Jerry is now seen at the top of the screen. As Tom jumps off the couch, the pillows are displaced, and he knocks over small decorative items, inadvertently damaging the television. The sequence concludes with Tom, now in the center middle ground, lunging as Jerry jumps from the television towards a round table with white flowers in the right foreground; a striped armchair is also visible in the right foreground. The camera tilts downward, concluding at a slightly high angle, using deep focus to maintain a large depth of field, smoothly tracking Tom and Jerry fighting in a small living room.",

    "Camera": "The camera begins at hip level with a slightly low angle, initially panning slightly left before transitioning to a rightward pan and moving to a level angle. It then tilts upward to track Tom chasing Jerry, moving upward to eye level. As the camera continues to pan right, it tilts downward, concluding at a slightly high angle. It uses deep focus, maintaining a large depth of field. The camera smoothly tracks Tom and Jerry fighting in a small living room, and during the rightward pan, Tom and Jerry become larger in the frame.",
    "Subject": "The video features two animated characters, Tom and Jerry, interacting within a live-action living room setting. Tom, a cartoon cat with blue-grey fur, white paws, muzzle, and belly, and yellow eyes, is depicted energetically chasing Jerry. Jerry, a small cartoon mouse with brown fur, a lighter brown belly and muzzle, and large ears, is shown actively running and jumping to evade Tom. Their chase sequence involves them moving across various pieces of furniture, starting with a light-colored, tufted sofa adorned with two cushions, followed by a grey round stool. In the background, a desk and a wall-mounted television displaying a black and white close-up image of a man's face are visible. The scene also includes a round table with white flowers and two black and white striped armchairs, adding to the dynamic setting of their playful pursuit.",
    "Motion": "Tom starts behind the sofa, trying to catch Jerry but missing, causing feathers to scatter behind the sofa. Jerry jumps onto the sofa, and Tom lunges across it in pursuit. As Tom jumps off the couch, the pillows are displaced. Tom lands on a round stool and leaps towards a wall-mounted television, knocking over small decorative items and inadvertently damaging the television. Jerry jumps from the top of the television, with Tom following closely. As Tom flies over a round table adorned with white flowers, he knocks the table over.",
    "Scene": "The video unfolds in a well-furnished room, likely a living area or hotel suite, as Tom energetically chases Jerry. The scene begins with Tom darting past a light-colored, tufted sofa adorned with geometric and striped pillows. As he races by, feathers float in the air, hinting at the chaos of the chase. The lighting, dim and atmospheric, suggests it is nighttime, with illumination streaming in from outside. Tom's pursuit takes him past a dark console table with gold legs, above which a large television screen is mounted, displaying a black and white image of a person. A desk lamp and other decorative items add to the room's elegance. Jerry scampers towards a round grey ottoman, with Tom hot on his heels. To the right, a black and white striped armchair and a round white table with flowers come into view as Tom navigates the space. The white walls with wainscoting and a window with curtains frame the scene, adding to the room's sophisticated ambiance as the chase continues.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
