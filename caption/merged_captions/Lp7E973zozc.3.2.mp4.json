  "merged_caption": "A medium shot frames a light-skinned, middle-aged woman with shoulder-length blonde hair from the waist up, positioned in the center foreground. She is wearing a brown, long-sleeved, V-neck top with a matching brown belt at her waist, and a small microphone is clipped to the neckline of her top. She wears bracelets on her left wrist and a watch on her right wrist. To her left, a large, blue-lit abstract structure occupies the background, while the rest of the background is dark. The scene is set on a dimly lit stage against a dark background, with lighting focused on the center of the stage where the woman is standing. Initially facing the camera, she stands on the stage, speaking and gesturing with her hands open and palms up. She then transfers a small, dark object from her left hand to her right hand and turns slightly to her right, gesturing toward her chest with her left hand. Her facial expression is animated as she speaks. The camera captures this at an eye-level, level-angle shot, starting slightly out of focus and, while it improves in sharpness towards the end, it remains somewhat blurry overall. Initially static with minor shaking, the camera then smoothly pans left to follow the woman's movement throughout the clip. As she continues to speak, she gestures again with both hands, turning her upper body to her right, looking toward the left side of the frame while remaining centrally positioned.",

    "Subject": "A light-skinned, middle-aged woman with shoulder-length blonde hair is shown speaking. She is wearing a brown, long-sleeved, V-neck top with a matching brown belt at her waist. A small microphone is clipped to the neckline of her top. She wears bracelets on her left wrist and a watch on her right wrist. Throughout the video, she gestures with her hands while talking and at one point holds a small, dark object, initially in her left hand before transitioning it to her right hand. Her facial expression is animated as she speaks.",
    "Motion": "A woman stands on a stage, speaking and gesturing with her hands open and palms up. She then transfers a small, dark object from her left hand to her right hand and turns slightly to her right, gesturing toward her chest with her left hand. She continues to speak, gesturing again with both hands.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set on a dimly lit stage against a dark background. To the right, a large, multi-tiered, abstract structure is illuminated with a vibrant blue light, contrasting with the surrounding darkness. The lighting is focused on the center of the stage, where a person is standing.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
