  "merged_caption": "This medium close-up shot features a man with voluminous, golden, curly hair that reaches his shoulders, wearing a dark suit jacket over a white shirt with a dark bowtie and a white flower corsage pinned to his left lapel, slow dancing with a woman with long, straight, golden hair in a light-colored garment. Initially, the woman is facing right on the left side of the frame, while the man is on the right, in profile, facing her. As they dance closely, maintaining eye contact and smiling, the camera arcs counter-clockwise around them, causing their positions relative to the camera to shift continuously; the man moves from the right to the left and back, and the woman from the left to the right and back, with each alternately having their face or back more prominently displayed. The camera is positioned between hip and eye level, looking up at the subjects from a low angle, employing a shallow depth of field to keep the couple in focus. The couple holds each other gently, moving in a slow, intimate dance, their movements smooth and synchronized, reflecting their connection and the joy of the moment. Star-shaped decorations made of reflective material are visible in the middle ground, illuminated by fixed colored lights in red, green, and blue, creating a romantic atmosphere. In the background, strip decorations are faintly visible, and a bright yellow-orange light source is located in the bottom center-left of the frame initially, creating a lens flare effect. The camera's slightly unsteady movement includes some shaking, enhancing the dynamic and lively setting of the indoor, dimly lit nighttime dance or party scene.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned between hip and eye level, looking up at the subjects from a low angle. It employs a shallow depth of field, keeping the couple in the foreground in focus. The camera arcs counterclockwise around the couple, with a slightly unsteady movement that includes some shaking.",
    "Subject": "A man with voluminous, golden, curly hair that reaches his shoulders is shown slow dancing with a woman. He wears a dark suit jacket over a white shirt with a dark bowtie, and a white flower corsage is pinned to his left lapel; he is smiling as he looks at the woman. The woman, who has long, straight, golden hair, wears a light-colored garment and looks back at the man as they dance closely.",
    "Motion": "The background is filled with colorful lights that create a romantic atmosphere. The couple holds each other gently, moving in a slow, intimate dance. The man and woman maintain eye contact, smiling and enjoying the moment. The couple continues to dance, moving slightly to the rhythm. The background lights add to the dynamic and lively setting. The couple's movements are smooth and synchronized, reflecting their connection and the joy of the moment.",
    "Scene": "An objective POV shot captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective, revealing an indoor, dimly lit nighttime dance or party setting where two figures slow dance. Star-shaped decorations made of reflective material hang from above, illuminated by fixed colored lights in red, yellow, green, and blue, each coming from different light sources. A prominent, bright yellow-orange light source creates a lens flare effect. The background features strip decorations in the room.",
    "Spatial": "This medium close-up shot features a man and a woman slow dancing in the foreground.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
