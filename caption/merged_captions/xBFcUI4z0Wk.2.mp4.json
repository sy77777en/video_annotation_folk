  "merged_caption": "This high-angle wide shot captures a crash scene on a banked racetrack at night, illuminated by bright lights. In the middle ground, a damaged white Ford race car, numbered 98 in red with blue and red graphics, is stationary in the center-right of the frame, positioned on the edge of the grass infield. Just behind it, in the center, a black and yellow race car, number 2, is also stationary and emitting white smoke. Further back in the middle ground at the top left, a white and black race car drives towards the camera along the upper part of the track. In the foreground, a blue and white race car moves from the bottom left across the lower portion of the frame, while the front of a red and yellow car is partially visible in the bottom left corner. The track itself curves from the bottom left towards the top right, with grandstands visible in the background at the top of the frame. The camera, capturing this high-angle, overhead shot, pans slightly to the right about halfway through the video to better center the crashed cars. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire racetrack and the crashed cars sharp. The dark asphalt surface of the track is marked with black tire scuffs and double yellow lines, curving around a green grass infield that has blue and white logos painted on it. The scene includes empty grandstands and a catch fence lining the outer edge of the track. Two race cars are involved in a crash on the turn, with the white and blue car, number 98, stopped on the grass, its front end visibly damaged, and the black and yellow car, number 2, stationary on the track, creating a cloud of white smoke. Other cars pass by the incident on the lower part of the track, driving normally.",

    "Subject": "A white Ford race car, numbered 98 in red with blue and red graphics, is stopped on the inside edge of a racetrack, partially on the grass, with its front end heavily damaged. Just behind it on the track, a black and yellow race car with the number 2 on its side emits white smoke. Further up the track, a white and black race car is seen driving normally.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
