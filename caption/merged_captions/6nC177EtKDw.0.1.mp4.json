  "merged_caption": "This is a level-angle full shot in a black-and-white video. In the foreground, the bow of a small wooden boat is positioned centrally, occupying the bottom half of the frame. The pointed bow, with ropes stretched across its weathered surface, juts forward into the dense, dark fog. In the middle ground, the upper bodies of two figures are visible, standing side-by-side in the top center of the frame, surrounded by rigging. They are presented as dark silhouettes, appearing to be men wearing what resemble sailor's caps. Their lower bodies are obscured by the wooden structure in the immediate foreground. The figures sway slightly, and the ropes on the boat gently swing, adding subtle motion to the scene. The background consists of dense fog, enhancing the monochromatic and grainy atmosphere. Faint vertical lines, possibly rigging, are visible near the figures, completing the obscure maritime setting. From a static, eye-level position, the camera captures the scene, but the video is too blurry to determine the focus.",

    "Subject": "In a black-and-white video, two figures stand on the deck of a boat, shrouded in dense, gray fog. They are presented as dark silhouettes, appearing to be men wearing what resemble sailor's caps. They stand still and side-by-side, facing forward. Their lower bodies are obscured by a wooden structure in the immediate foreground, likely the bow of a smaller boat, which has ropes running along its surface and occupies the bottom half of the view.",
    "Motion": "This video captures a scene where the two figures on the boat are swaying slightly, and the ropes on the boat are gently swinging.",
    "Scene": "From a level-angle perspective at the bow of a small wooden boat, the scene is enveloped in dense, dark fog. The pointed bow, with ropes stretched across its weathered surface, juts forward into the gloom. Two indistinct figures, wearing caps, are seated nearby, their forms obscured by the monochromatic and grainy atmosphere. Faint vertical lines, possibly rigging, are visible near the figures, completing the obscure maritime setting.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
