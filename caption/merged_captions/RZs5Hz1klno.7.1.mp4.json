  "merged_caption": "This is a wide, static scenery shot of a snow-covered mountain landscape, focusing on the overall environment rather than a specific subject. In the foreground and across the bottom of the frame, there are snow-covered mountain ridges. A massive, dark cube is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground and partially obscured by the foreground mountains. Additional mountain peaks are visible in the middle ground to the left and right of the cube, as well as in the background. The overcast sky fills the top portion of the frame. The camera is positioned at a level angle, looking across the landscape. From this level angle, the camera smoothly dollies forward through the snowy mountain landscape. A deep focus keeps the entire scene, from the foreground mountains to the large cube in the background, sharp and clear. The camera moves forward through a surreal landscape, revealing a massive, dark, featureless cube sitting among snow-covered mountains under a gloomy, overcast sky. The entire scene is bathed in a cold, blue light. A video filmed by a drone captures a vast, snow-covered mountain range under a dim, overcast sky. A massive, dark, featureless cube rests among the jagged peaks, its perfect geometric form contrasting with the natural landscape. The entire scene is cast in a cold, blue light, with the wind visibly moving through the scene. A small white overlay displaying \"[29,30]\" is present in the lower left corner. The focus is on the immense scale and the mysterious, unsettling atmosphere created by the juxtaposition of the natural landscape and the unnatural geometric form, rather than on a specific, active subject.",

    "Subject": "This is a landscape scenery shot of a vast, desolate mountain range covered in snow under a gloomy, overcast sky. The scene is bathed in a cold, blue light, emphasizing the frigid and remote environment. A massive, dark, featureless cube, a surreal monolith, sits amidst the rugged peaks, its sheer size dwarfing the surrounding mountains.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
