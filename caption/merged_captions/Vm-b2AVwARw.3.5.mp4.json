  "merged_caption": "A close-up shot, filmed from above, shows a stylized cartoon hand in the foreground on the right, holding a smartphone that occupies the center of the frame. The hand and phone remain stationary against a blurred, neutral-toned background. The primary dynamic element is the content displayed on the phone's screen, which continuously cycles through various animated educational modules, including diagrams, graphs, and interactive menus. The camera focuses on the smartphone held in the foreground, employing an extremely shallow depth of field that blurs the background. The camera executes a slow and smooth counterclockwise arc and roll, gradually approaching the device. A cursor arrow appears on the screen, moving to interact with different on-screen elements. The word \"Brilliant\" is written in green before turning black. The screen then displays a series of animated lessons, starting with one titled \"Exterior Angles.\" First, a blue gear rotates, causing a smaller yellow gear to spin as a cursor adjusts a slider. Next, a cursor clicks on a grid to draw a diagonal line of black squares. The view changes to a lesson plan, where the cursor selects a topic. Subsequently, on a scatter plot, a cursor drags two sliders, altering the shape of a parabolic curve. This is followed by a graphic of the Earth, where a purple sphere representing a satellite signal expands and contracts as a slider is moved. Finally, on another scatter plot, a cursor drags the endpoint of a line, changing its slope and a corresponding numerical value. A white rectangular overlay with black text reading \"AD\" is visible in the top right corner of the frame.",

    "Camera": "From a high, eye-level angle, the camera focuses on a smartphone held in the foreground, employing an extremely shallow depth of field that blurs the background. The camera executes a slow and smooth counterclockwise arc and roll, gradually approaching the device.",
    "Subject": "A stylized, light-skinned cartoon hand holds a black smartphone horizontally. The phone's white screen displays a series of interactive educational lessons from an app, starting with its logo, the word \"Brilliant,\" which is initially written in green ink following the stroke order before changing to black text. The content on the screen then cycles through various animated and interactive modules. An initial module is labeled \"Exterior Angles.\" Another module demonstrates gear rotation with blue, grey, and yellow gears. A different module shows a diagram related to pattern recognition, with shapes connected to a grid where a diagonal line is being drawn. A lesson on probability lists topics like \"Uniform Probabilities\" and \"Intro to Simulation.\" Another module displays a scatter plot with a blue parabolic curve and interactive sliders, followed by a multiple-choice question about the model. A lesson illustrates GPS location with a graphic of the Earth and a satellite's signal sphere. A final example shows a scatter plot demonstrating \"Mean Squared Error\" with data on penguin weight versus bill depth. A cursor arrow is visible interacting with the on-screen elements, such as sliders and buttons.",

    "Scene": "In a softly lit setting with a blurred, neutral-toned background, a stylized, cartoon-like hand holds a black smartphone horizontally. The video displays a series of educational application contents on the phone's screen. Initially, the word \"Brilliant\" appears as a logo. The display then transitions through various interactive lessons, starting with an \"exterior angles\" lesson, followed by animated diagrams of gear rotations, a visual representation of a neural network, a menu for a probability course, a scatter plot with a parabolic curve, an animated model of GPS location relative to the Earth, and a graph demonstrating mean squared error. These contents feature clean graphics, charts, and interactive elements like sliders and multiple-choice questions. A white rectangular overlay with black text reading \"AD\" is visible in the top right corner of the frame.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
