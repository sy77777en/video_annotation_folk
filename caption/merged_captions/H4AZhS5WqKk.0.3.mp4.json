  "merged_caption": "The scene is captured in an extreme wide shot from a low-angle perspective, looking up at the dark facade of a building that occupies most of the frame in the middle ground. In the upper center, an illuminated window and its small balcony with an ornate, dark metal railing are visible. Within the window, an orange, animated, mouse-like character with a round head, large elliptical white eyes with black pupils, and a prominent light orange muzzle stands on a windowsill. Next to the character is a transparent, conical object that appears to be made of glass. The character skillfully uses a toothpick held in its right hand, lifting several spherical objects from a bowl, tossing them into the air, and expertly skewering them with the toothpick using one hand as they fall. The character's body bobs slightly in sync with this dynamic motion. The black utility wires with white ceramic insulators run diagonally from the top right corner in the foreground toward the center in the middle ground. A portion of the dark night sky is visible in the background at the top right. The entire composition remains static throughout the shot, with the camera using a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp and in focus. The dark, textured exterior of the building is shown at night under a dark blue sky, and the surface of the building appears damp, as if from a light rain.",

    "Scene": "From a low-angle perspective, the dark, textured exterior of a building is shown at night under a dark blue sky. A single rectangular window on an upper floor is illuminated from within by a warm, yellow light. In front of the window is a small, decorative balcony with an ornate, dark metal railing. To the right, black utility wires with white ceramic insulators are attached to the building's facade. The surface of the building appears damp, as if from a light rain.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
