  "merged_caption": "This is a high-angle, close-up shot of a yellowed, aged paper map of a coastal region in Scotland, filling the entire frame in the background. The map shows cities like Glasgow and Kilmarnock, and islands such as Arran and Kintyre, with roads and land features detailed. A classic magnifying glass with a round lens and a dark rim is positioned in the bottom right quadrant, with its lens centered over Kilmarnock, enlarging the area and revealing details of nearby towns and roads. A small, dark ink drop is visible on the map near the Kintyre peninsula in the top left. Approximately half a second into the video, an ink drop appears and drops onto the map. The scene is cast in warm, directional lighting from the bottom left, creating distinct, dark shadows that fall across both the upper right and bottom right areas of the frame. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the entire map in sharp focus, and remains static throughout the video.",

    "Subject": "A yellowed, aged paper map of a coastal region in Scotland is laid out, showing cities like Glasgow and Kilmarnock, and islands such as Arran and Kintyre, with roads and land features detailed.

    "Scene": "An aged, yellowed map of a coastal region of Scotland lies on a flat surface. A round magnifying glass with a dark rim is placed over the map, enlarging the area around Kilmarnock and revealing details of nearby towns and roads. The map itself shows signs of use, with a small, dark ink drop near the Kintyre peninsula. Warm, directional lighting from the bottom left casts distinct, dark shadows over both the upper right and bottom right corners of the map, which includes the city of Glasgow.",
    "Spatial": "This is a high-angle, close-up shot of a map. The aged map of Scotland fills the entire frame in the background. In the foreground, a magnifying glass is positioned in the bottom right quadrant, with its lens centered over the map. A small ink drop is visible on the map in the top left, while prominent shadows are cast across both the upper right and bottom right areas of the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
