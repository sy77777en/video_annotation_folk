  "merged_caption": "A full shot, filmed at the subject's level, frames a man in a dark suit with short, gray hair standing at a wooden podium located in the center-right of the frame and in the middle ground. He appears to be addressing a group of people, suggesting he is the main subject. In the foreground at the bottom-left, a woman with light hair, wearing a white shirt, extends a microphone toward him, indicating a press event. A crowd of people, including photographers and journalists holding cameras and recording equipment, is positioned in the middle ground, occupying the left and center of the frame. On the far right, an American flag stands prominently next to a wall adorned with a series of framed portraits, with another dark flag positioned behind the lectern. The setting is a formal room with blue-gray walls and light-colored, patterned carpeting, contributing to the official atmosphere. The lighting is brighter on the right side, while the left side has a dim green-blue tint. The shot is captured from an eye-level perspective with a deep focus, rendering the entire room from the foreground reporter to the background wall in sharp detail. The camera executes a slow and subtle zoom-in while slightly rotating counterclockwise, gradually tightening the frame on the man at the podium and the people immediately surrounding him. In the foreground on the right side of the frame, two more American flags are visible, enhancing the formal setting. The scene evolves as the camera movement emphasizes the man at the podium, highlighting his role as the central figure in this press event.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
