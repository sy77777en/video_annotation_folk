  "merged_caption": "The video presents a full shot of a person standing in front of a yellow house, capturing the subject from head to waist. The person, with medium-length, straight red hair, is wearing a white short-sleeved shirt and dark high-waisted pants, positioned in the foreground on the left side of the frame with their back to the camera. The house occupies almost the entire frame, stretching across from left to right in the middle ground. The house's white door is located centrally in the middle ground, slightly ajar, with the number \"6701\" slightly to the left on the wall. The brick chimney is situated in the middle ground towards the top left of the house. A small garden with green shrubs lies in the foreground on the right, while red flowers and additional greenery are in the middle ground on the bottom left. A small figurine of a character with a red hat and white beard is placed near the bottom left corner of the frame, close to the garden. The house's window, with decorative crossbars, is located in the middle ground on the left side of the frame. The camera features a smooth movement at hip level, capturing a low-angle view of the person standing in front of the house. The camera moves backward while simultaneously zooming in, maintaining deep focus with a large depth of field, ensuring all elements remain sharp. The setting is a sunny day, with a clear blue sky and well-maintained green grass in the front yard. The person remains stationary, facing the house, appearing to be observing it, suggesting they may be about to enter or have just arrived. The overall composition remains static, focusing on the person and the house, with no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial positioning of the subjects and elements within the frame.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
