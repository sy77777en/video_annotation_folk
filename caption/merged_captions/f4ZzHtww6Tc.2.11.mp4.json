  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot from a level-angle perspective, showing a light-skinned man with tattoos on his arms, wearing a white t-shirt with a blue graphic, dark blue cuffed jeans, white sneakers, and a blue baseball cap worn backward, skateboarding into the frame from the right middle ground. The scene is set in an urban plaza with a brick-paved surface, featuring a wide set of shallow concrete stairs and a large, abstract metal sculpture with sail-like components. Modern city skyscrapers and green trees are visible under a bright, clear sky. As the skateboarder rides across the plaza, he leaps down a series of steps, performs a trick in mid-air, and continues to glide along a low stone ledge. The camera, with noticeable fisheye distortion, starts at hip level and moves to ground level, smoothly panning left to track the skateboarder. It tilts slightly upward as he jumps and downward as he lands, maintaining a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. The skateboarder progresses into the foreground, skating towards the left of the frame, and eventually reaches the left middle ground, continuing to skate away. Meanwhile, another individual in the middle ground, dressed in a white shirt and dark pants, passes by and glances briefly. The camera's movement complements the skateboarder's action, first tilting upward and then downward throughout the sequence, capturing the dynamic motion against the backdrop of the plaza's red and brown brick pattern and concrete walkways.",

    "Subject": "A light-skinned man with tattoos on his arms is skateboarding in an urban plaza. He wears a white t-shirt with a blue graphic on the front, dark blue cuffed jeans, white sneakers, and a blue baseball cap worn backward. Another individual in the middle ground, dressed in a white shirt and dark pants, passed by and glanced briefly.",
    "Motion": "A skateboarder rides across a brick plaza, leaps down a series of steps, performs a trick in mid-air, then continues to glide along a low stone ledge before moving away from the camera as a pedestrian walks up the stairs.",
    "Scene": "From a level perspective on a brick-paved plaza, the scene captures a wide set of shallow concrete stairs. Beside the stairs stands a large, abstract metal sculpture with sail-like components, set against a backdrop of modern city skyscrapers and green trees under a bright, clear sky. The plaza is paved with a pattern of red and brown bricks alongside concrete walkways. A person on a skateboard is visible descending the stairs on the right and also skateboarding in the open area to the left.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a wide shot from a level-angle perspective, showing a person on a skateboard entering from the right middle ground. As he progresses, he gradually moves into the foreground, skating towards the left of the frame. He eventually reaches the left middle ground, continuing to skate away. Another individual in the middle ground passed by and glanced briefly. The camera pans left to track the skateboarder, first tilting upward and then downward throughout the action."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
