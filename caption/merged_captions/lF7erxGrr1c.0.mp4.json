  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot from a high angle, a line of dirt modified race cars, characterized by their open-wheel design, large side panels, and rear spoilers, is positioned in the middle ground, moving from the right side of the frame towards the left on an outdoor dirt race track in the evening, illuminated by large stadium lights. The cars display a variety of color schemes and graphics, including a white car with red and black markings, a black and red car, a white car with blue and red accents, a prominent yellow and red car, and a blue and yellow car. In the middle ground, in front of the moving cars, a white pickup truck and a white ambulance with red and black stripes are parked in the infield, which is a mix of grass and dirt. A few people are also in the infield, including a man in a yellow safety vest and another person wearing pink pants. The background consists of trees and spectator grandstands along the top of the frame. The camera, from an overhead, second-floor height, uses a deep focus to capture the entire scene and smoothly tracks the race by panning left and zooming in on the cars. As the cars drive slowly in a two-by-two formation around a wide turn, the camera tilts down, shifting from a level to a high-angle view to keep them in the frame. As they exit the turn and enter a straightaway, the cars accelerate together. The camera continues to pan to the left, following the pack as they race along the dirt track, sliding through the subsequent turns while largely maintaining their relative positions. As the pan continues, the initial group of cars moves across the center of the frame, while more cars enter from the right, filling the middle ground. The cars then navigate a turn, moving from the center of the frame towards the bottom as they round the bend. A text overlay reading \"GSPVIDEO.COM\" remains fixed in the top right corner throughout the shot.",

    "Subject": "A group of dirt modified race cars, characterized by their open-wheel design, large side panels, and rear spoilers, are on a dirt track. The cars display a variety of color schemes and graphics; one is white with red and black markings, another is black and red, one is white with blue and red accents, and a prominent one is yellow and red. Other cars in the pack include a blue and yellow car. In the infield area, several non-racing vehicles are present, including a white pickup truck and a white ambulance with red and black stripes. A few people are also in the infield, including a man in a yellow safety vest and another person wearing pink pants.",
    "Motion": "A group of dirt modified race cars drives slowly in a two-by-two formation around a wide turn on a dirt track. As they exit the turn and enter a straightaway, the cars accelerate together. The camera pans to follow the pack as they continue to race around the oval track, sliding through the subsequent turns while largely maintaining their relative positions.",
    "Scene": "An outdoor dirt race track is shown in the evening, illuminated by large stadium lights. A line of brightly colored modified race cars, adorned with numbers and decals, circles the brown dirt oval. The infield is a mix of grass and dirt, with several vehicles parked, including an ambulance and a white pickup truck. In the background, spectator grandstands are visible, with a line of green trees and hills beyond the track. The camera pans to follow the cars as they move along the track. A text overlay reading \"GSPVIDEO.COM\" is visible in the top right corner.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
