  "merged_caption": "A full shot captures a male lion with tawny fur and a short, scruffy, light brown mane resting on sandy ground in the middle ground. The lion's body occupies the left and center of the frame, with its head positioned in the center. The animal is lying on sandy ground that fills the entire frame from the foreground to the background. The camera angle is positioned slightly above the lion, capturing the scene from a high, eye-level angle with deep focus, ensuring the entire scene is sharp. The shot remains static throughout the clip, with only slight unintentional shaking. Initially, the lion is positioned with its body angled, its head turned towards the right, and its mouth slightly open, revealing its tongue and teeth. Its amber-colored eyes are open, and its front paws are stretched out before it as it rests. The lion briefly sticks out its tongue to lick its nose before closing its mouth. It then turns its head to its right, facing the camera. The outdoor scene is captured in daylight, with dappled sunlight casting shadows across the dry, sandy ground. A few scattered, dry leaves are visible on the ground around the animal.",

    "Camera": "From a high, eye-level angle, the camera captures a lion with a deep focus, ensuring the entire scene is sharp. The camera remains mostly stationary, with only slight unintentional shaking.",
    "Subject": "A male lion with tawny fur is lying down on sandy ground. It has a short, scruffy, light brown mane around its head and neck. Initially, the lion is positioned with its body angled, its head turned towards the right, and its mouth slightly open, revealing its tongue and teeth. Its amber-colored eyes are open, and its front paws are stretched out before it as it rests. Later, the lion turns its face towards the camera and closes its mouth.",
    "Motion": "The male lion rests on the sandy ground with its mouth slightly open, briefly sticking out its tongue to lick its nose before closing its mouth. It then turns its head to its right, facing the camera.",
    "Scene": "An outdoor scene is captured in daylight, with dappled sunlight casting shadows across the dry, sandy ground. A young male lion with a tawny coat and a developing mane lies resting on the uneven, light-brown earth. Most of its body is located in the left-center of the frame, while its head is positioned in the center, with its mouth slightly agape. A few scattered, dry leaves are visible on the ground around the animal.",
    "Spatial": "A full shot captures a male lion resting in the middle ground. The lion's body occupies the left and center of the frame, with its head positioned in the center.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
