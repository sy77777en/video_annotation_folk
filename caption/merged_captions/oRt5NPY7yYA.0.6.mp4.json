  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot, a convoy of vehicles is positioned horizontally across the center of the frame, situated in the middle ground. The main subject, a large white semi-truck with a dark-colored cab and a long, unmarked rectangular white trailer, is located at the center of this formation, escorted by several dark, armored military-style vehicles and a black and white police SUV at both the front and rear. The camera, positioned at a level angle approximately at the height of a second floor, provides a straight-ahead view of the subject from an elevated perspective. It tracks parallel to the convoy, moving from right to left, which keeps the vehicles relatively static in the center of the frame. This camera movement causes the sandy terrain and sparse bushes in the foreground to blur past, while the rolling hills and a faint city skyline in the background move swiftly to the right. The convoy travels in a single-file formation from right to left across a desert road, maintaining a consistent speed and their positions within the convoy. The scene takes place during the day under a bright, slightly overcast sky, with the terrain consisting of sandy, light-brown ground and rolling hills dotted with sparse, low-lying green bushes. In the distance, larger, pale hills form the horizon, with the faint silhouette of a city skyline visible. From a smooth, overhead perspective at roughly a second-floor height, the camera maintains a level angle as it moves quickly, trucking left to track the caravan of military vehicles through the desert. The shot uses a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera also moves forward to highlight the convoy and finishes with a slight pan to the right.",

    "Subject": "A long convoy of vehicles travels along a road through an arid, desert-like landscape. The main subject is a large semi-trailer truck positioned in the center of the convoy, featuring a dark-colored cab and a long, rectangular, unmarked white trailer. This truck is escorted by several other vehicles. In front of the white truck are three dark, boxy, armored military-style trucks. Leading the entire procession is a black and white police SUV. Following behind the central white truck are two more dark, armored military-style trucks, identical to those at the front. A second black and white police SUV brings up the rear, completing the single-file formation.",
    "Motion": "A convoy of vehicles, including a central semi-trailer truck, several armored trucks, and two police SUVs, travels in a single-file formation from right to left across a desert road. All vehicles move at a consistent speed, maintaining their positions within the convoy. The camera tracks alongside the procession, causing the foreground landscape to blur with motion.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures a convoy of vehicles moving along a paved road that cuts through a vast, arid landscape. The scene takes place during the day under a bright, slightly overcast sky. The terrain consists of sandy, light-brown ground and rolling hills dotted with sparse, low-lying green bushes. In the distance, larger, pale hills form the horizon, with the faint silhouette of a city skyline visible. The convoy prominently features a large white semi-truck with a dark-colored cab and a long, unmarked rectangular white trailer, escorted by several dark, armored military-style vehicles and a police SUV at both the front and rear.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
