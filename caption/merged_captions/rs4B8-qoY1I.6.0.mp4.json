  "merged_caption": "This wide shot is captured from an isometric angle, showing a pixelated, third-person gaming scene in a paved courtyard surrounded by brick buildings. A heads-up display occupies about one-quarter of the screen on the left, featuring character portraits, status bars, weapon icons, a minimap, and a command box with text that changes from \"EVACUATE\" to \"GOING.\" In the center, a squad of four figures clad in long, olive-green trench coats, each holding a rifle, stands with two individuals in simple black suits. Red numbers, 1 through 4, are displayed above the figures in green, with the number \"1\" occasionally flashing yellow. The figures are positioned near a building with a dark roof on the right, while another building and a set of stairs are visible at the top of the frame. A small wheeled device rests in the bottom right, and a person's body lies near the building on the right, on a red area on the ground, presumably blood. The reddish-brown ground is marked with yellow and black hazard stripes, white dashed lines, and circular grates. A mouse cursor moves horizontally at the vertical center of the frame, flicking to the left to shift the camera view. As the button labeled \"EVACUATE\" changes to \"GOING,\" the squad of four figures in green coats, followed by the two individuals in black suits, turns to the left and begins walking in that direction. The camera smoothly snaps to the left multiple times as the cursor drags the scene, tracking all the individuals as they walk towards the left side of the frame.",

    "Subject": "In a pixelated, isometric view, a squad of four figures stands in a group. Each figure is clad in a long, olive-green trench coat and holds a rifle. Red numbers, 1 through 4, are displayed above their respective heads, with the number \"1\" alternating between red and yellow. Close-up portraits show these figures wearing light blue goggles, with the tops of their heads appearing red. Two figures in simple black suits stand nearby, initially facing the squad. As the squad turns left and begins walking, both men in black suits follow them.",

    "Scene": "A third-person isometric (2.5D) gaming video with a tilted overhead angle shows the environment in a three-quarters perspective. The scene is set in an outdoor, paved courtyard surrounded by brick buildings. One building has a dark, flat roof with vents and some green coloring, while another building is initially barely visible in the bottom right of the frame, with only a part of its roof showing. At the top of the frame, a set of stairs leads up. The reddish-brown ground is marked with yellow and black hazard stripes, white dashed lines, and circular grates. A group of four figures in green coats and two figures in black suits stand in the open area. A person's body lies near the building on the right, on a red area on the ground, presumably blood. A heads-up display (HUD) occupies the left side of the screen, showing character portraits, status bars, weapon icons, a minimap, and a command box with text that changes from \"EVACUATE\" to \"GOING.\" Red numbers from one to four are overlaid above the figures in green, with the red \"1\" occasionally flashing yellow.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
