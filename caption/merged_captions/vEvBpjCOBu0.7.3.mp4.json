  "merged_caption": "Initially, the frame is dominated by a dark, textured floor in the foreground, occupying the lower portion, with a brown wooden paneled wall in the background filling the upper portion. A dark green hanging plant is positioned in the background, top left-center against the wall, while a wooden furniture leg is visible in the middle ground on the right. The video, captured from an objective point of view, plays in slow-motion with the camera positioned at ground level with a level angle, employing a shallow depth of field initially focusing on the background. A rectangular tray, which appears to be made of a coppery or dark metallic material and features ornate, dark metallic handles on its shorter sides, then enters the frame from the top left, accompanied by two clear, cylindrical glasses, which are slightly tapered towards their bases, and lands on its side in the middle ground, sharing the same depth of field as the wooden furniture leg. As the tray and glasses approach the ground, the glasses initially bounce on their bases before tipping over and rolling towards the camera. One glass rolls from the middle ground towards the center-right foreground, settling on its side and remaining fully visible. The second glass also rolls from the middle ground to the foreground but moves partially out of frame or becomes obscured, likely towards the left. A brown liquid spill is visible on the floor in the bottom right foreground, near the wooden leg. A white text overlay \"[27]\" is consistently present in the bottom left corner of the foreground, and near the end, the text changes to \"[28]\". The camera smoothly moves backward, and the focus slowly shifts to the foreground, bringing the fallen glasses into focus.",

    "Camera": "The video plays in slow-motion. The camera is positioned at ground level with a level angle. It employs a shallow depth of field, initially focusing on the background. The focus then slowly shifts to the foreground, bringing the fallen glasses into focus. The camera smoothly moves backward.",
    "Subject": "The video initially presents a level angle above the ground of a dark, textured floor in front of a brown wooden paneled wall, where a dark green hanging plant and the wooden leg of a piece of furniture are visible. Subsequently, a rectangular tray, which appears to be made of a coppery or dark metallic material and features ornate, dark metallic handles on its shorter sides, falls into the frame from above. Two clear, cylindrical glasses, which are slightly tapered towards their bases, fall along with the tray. After impact, the tray comes to rest on one of its longer edges, while the two glasses roll across the floor. One glass rolls partially out of the frame or becomes obscured, while the other glass rolls and settles on its side, remaining fully visible on the floor.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a view of a wooden paneled wall and a hanging plant, with a piece of furniture partially visible on the right side. A tray starts to fall from above, gradually becoming more visible as it descends. Two clear glasses fall alongside the tray from the front. As the tray and glasses approach the ground, the glasses initially bounce on their bases before tipping over and rolling towards the camera. The final frames show the tray and glasses lying on the floor, with one glass partially out of the frame and the other glass settled on its side.",
    "Scene": "The video, captured from an objective point of view, depicts an indoor setting featuring a dark brown, vertically paneled wooden wall and a grey, textured concrete or stone floor. A dark green, leafy plant hangs from the upper part of the wooden wall. On the right side of the scene, a wooden leg, likely belonging to a table or chair, is visible. A copper-colored metal tray with ornate, dark metal handles, initially out of view, swings down from the top left and falls onto the floor. Two clear, empty glasses, which were on the tray, also fall, with both glasses bouncing and rolling slightly after impact. A brown liquid spill is visible on the floor in front of the table leg on the right side of the frame. An overlay of white text \"[27]\" is present in the bottom left corner throughout most of the video, changing to \"[28]\" near the end.",
    "Spatial": "Initially, the frame is dominated by a dark, textured floor in the foreground, occupying the lower portion, with a brown wooden paneled wall in the background filling the upper portion. A dark green hanging plant is positioned in the background, top left-center against the wall, while a wooden furniture leg is visible in the middle ground on the right. A rectangular tray then enters the frame from the top left, accompanied by two clear glasses, and lands on its side in the middle ground, sharing the same depth of field as the wooden furniture leg.

A white text overlay \"[27]\" is consistently present in the bottom left corner of the foreground, and near the end, the text changes to \"[28]\". When the tray and glasses appear, becoming the subjects, the camera is at their height."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
