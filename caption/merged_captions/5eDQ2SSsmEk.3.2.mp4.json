  "merged_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot focusing on a hand interacting with a control panel. Initially, the hand, with a light skin tone and wearing a dark, ribbed sleeve, occupies the center of the frame, positioned in the foreground, while the control panel is on the left side of the frame, situated in the middle ground. The hand is seen turning a knob on the control panel, changing the displayed number from 17 to 22. The video begins with a low-angle close-up of the hand operating a radio console, with a shallow depth of field focusing on the midground. The camera slightly zooms in on the hand and console, then quickly tilts downward to follow the operation process. The hand then moves to the right and down to interact with another component, which shows various technical data and graphics. The control panel features illuminated buttons and displays, with orange and red lights indicating active settings. Midway through the video, the camera shifts focus to reveal another screen, which is now centered in the frame. This screen, displaying technical data and graphics, is positioned further back in the middle ground. The transition from the hand and control panel to the screen occurs smoothly, maintaining the close-up shot size. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout. The overall scene is dimly lit, with a focus on the interaction between the hand and the equipment, highlighting the technological and manual aspects of the setting. The equipment is characterized by dark metallic surfaces with illuminated buttons and dials, emitting a warm orange glow. The lighting is low, creating a moody ambiance with shadows and focused highlights on the devices. The overall color scheme is a mix of dark tones with contrasting bright lights, enhancing the technological and slightly mysterious feel of the setting.",

    "Subject": "The video features a close-up of a hand interacting with a control panel. The hand, with a light skin tone, is adjusting dials on a device that resembles a vintage radio or communication equipment. The hand is wearing a dark, ribbed sleeve, suggesting a sweater or jacket. The device has illuminated buttons and displays, with orange and red lights indicating active settings. After the midway point, a screen is revealed displaying technical data and graphics, possibly related to navigation or communication. The overall scene is dimly lit, with a focus on the interaction between the hand and the equipment, highlighting the technological and manual aspects of the setting.",

    "Scene": "The video depicts an indoor setting with a dimly lit, high-tech environment. The scene features a hand interacting with electronic equipment, including a radio and a screen displaying data. The equipment is characterized by dark metallic surfaces with illuminated buttons and dials, emitting a warm orange glow. The screen shows complex graphics and text, suggesting a technical or control room atmosphere. The lighting is low, creating a moody ambiance with shadows and focused highlights on the devices. The overall color scheme is a mix of dark tones with contrasting bright lights, enhancing the technological and slightly mysterious feel of the setting.",
    "Spatial": "The video presents a close-up shot focusing on a hand interacting with a control panel. Initially, the hand occupies the center of the frame, positioned in the foreground, while the control panel is on the left side of the frame, situated in the middle ground. The hand, located in the middle of the frame, moves slightly as it adjusts the dials. The control panel features illuminated buttons and displays. Midway through the video, the camera shifts focus to reveal another screen, which is now centered in the frame. This screen, displaying technical data and graphics, is positioned further back in the middle ground.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
