  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot of a Black male, wearing a white t-shirt and having short hair and a beard, viewed through a rough, circular hole in a wooden surface positioned in the foreground. This hole acts as a frame, centering the man in the midground against a background landscape of an expansive field, distant horizon, white clouds, and a wide sky, suggesting daytime. The static camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle throughout, using a shallow depth of field to keep the man in focus while the foreground (the hole) and background (the field and sky) are blurred. The camera captures him from a straight-on angle, centering him against the open landscape visible through the hole. Suddenly, the man falls backward in slow motion, gradually moving further away from the camera and eventually disappearing below the bottom edge of the hole's view, leaving only the foreground frame and the background landscape visible. As the sequence progresses, the man exits the scene, leaving only the view of the field and horizon. The setting is characterized by its simplicity and natural elements, with the wall providing a unique frame for the scene.",

    "Camera": "The video plays in slow motion. The static camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle throughout. It uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the man in the midground in focus while the foreground (the hole) and background (the field and sky) are blurred.",
    "Subject": "The video features a Black male positioned behind a hole in a wooden board, with the board in the foreground and the man in the midground. He is wearing a white t-shirt and has short hair and a beard. The camera captures him from a straight-on angle, centering him against an open landscape visible through the hole. As the sequence progresses, the man falls backward in slow motion, gradually descending out of the frame. The camera remains fixed, keeping the hole as a natural frame while the subject exits the scene.",
    "Motion": "A man in a white t-shirt stands behind a hole in a wooden board, looking directly at the camera. Suddenly, he falls backward, gradually moving further away from the camera and eventually out of the frame. As he exits, only the hole and the landscape remain visible in the background.",
    "Scene": "The video showcases an outdoor setting in a rural area, viewed through a hole in a wooden wall. A Black man is positioned behind the hole, with the wall in the foreground and the man in the midground. The scene behind him features an expansive field, a distant horizon, white clouds, and a wide sky, suggesting daytime. As the video progresses, the man is no longer present, leaving only the view of the field and horizon. The setting is characterized by its simplicity and natural elements, with the wall providing a unique frame for the scene.",
    "Spatial": "The video starts with a medium shot of a Black male, viewed through a rough, circular hole in a wooden surface positioned in the foreground. This hole acts as a frame, centering the man in the middle ground against a background landscape of a field and cloudy sky. The camera maintains a fixed, straight-on angle relative to the man. During the shot, the man falls straight backward, eventually disappearing below the bottom edge of the hole's view, leaving only the foreground frame and the background landscape visible."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
