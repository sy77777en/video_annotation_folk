  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a person with shoulder-length, slightly curly hair, initially positioned in the bottom right of the frame, appearing as a dark silhouette near a staircase. The camera is at eye level and starts at a level angle, using deep focus with a large depth of field. As the scene progresses, the shot transitions to a wide shot, capturing more of the environment, including a sleek, metallic railing and a distinctive hanging light fixture casting a soft glow. The subject moves from the bottom right towards the center of the frame, ascending the staircase quickly and chaotically, holding onto the railing for support. The camera moves forward slightly while quickly panning left to track the person, and tilts up as they ascend, shifting to a low angle to emphasize the ascent. The hanging light fixture is positioned in the top center of the frame, suspended in the middle ground, swinging erratically and casting a dynamic glow. Decorative plants are visible in the background, adding depth and a natural element to the scene. The setting is a dimly lit interior during nighttime, characterized by a modern architectural style with clean lines and minimalistic design elements. The walls are adorned with leafy plants, enhancing the contrast between light and dark areas. The subject's t-shirt displays two large white numbers or letters on the back, becoming more visible as they climb higher. The camera's smooth movement with minimal shaking enhances the sense of urgency and disorder as the person continues upward, becoming increasingly visible with each step. The overall atmosphere is tense and shadowy, with limited visibility of the person's features and attire, contributing to a sense of movement and progression within the space.",

    "Subject": "The video features a dimly lit interior scene with a staircase. A person is present, characterized by a dark silhouette, making specific details about their appearance difficult to discern. They have shoulder-length, slightly curly hair and are positioned near the staircase, suggesting movement or interaction with it. The back of their t-shirt seems to display two large white numbers or letters. The staircase has a sleek, metallic railing, and a distinctive hanging light fixture is visible, casting a soft glow. The setting includes some foliage, possibly decorative plants, adding texture to the scene. The overall atmosphere is shadowy, with limited visibility of the person's features and attire.",
    "Motion": "In a dimly lit interior, a person with shoulder-length hair is initially seen as a dark silhouette near a staircase. As they begin to ascend, holding onto the sleek, metallic railing for support, their features become more visible. The distinctive hanging light fixture casts a soft glow, illuminating the person as they steadily climb higher. The light fixture and foliage in the background remain consistent as the person continues upward, becoming increasingly visible with each step.",
    "Scene": "The video depicts an indoor setting during nighttime, characterized by dim lighting and a modern architectural style. The environment features a staircase with a sleek, metallic handrail that curves elegantly. A large, decorative light fixture hangs from the ceiling, swinging erratically and casting a dynamic glow. The walls are adorned with leafy plants, adding a natural element to the scene. The atmosphere is tense, with shadows playing across the surfaces, enhancing the contrast between light and dark areas. A person is running up the stairs quickly and chaotically, contributing to a sense of urgency and disorder. The setting suggests a contemporary interior with a focus on clean lines and minimalistic design elements.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a close-up shot of the subject's head and shoulders, initially positioned in the bottom right of the frame. As the scene progresses, the shot transitions to a wide shot, capturing more of the environment. The subject moves from the bottom right towards the center of the frame, ascending the staircase. In the wide shot, the subject is now in the middle ground, with the staircase and its metallic railing prominently featured towards the left side of the frame, extending into the background. The hanging light fixture is positioned in the top center of the frame, suspended in the middle ground. Decorative plants are visible in the background, adding depth to the scene. The camera height shifts from being at the subject's level to below them, emphasizing the ascent up the stairs. This change in perspective enhances the sense of movement and progression within the space."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
