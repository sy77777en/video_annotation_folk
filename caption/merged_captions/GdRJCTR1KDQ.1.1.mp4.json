  "merged_caption": "The video presents a full shot of an old, off-white electronic device, initially positioned upright and centered in the foreground on a concrete surface that occupies the bottom of the frame. The device has a bulky, rectangular shape with the upper portion of the back being rectangular and the lower part near the ground curved, resembling a semicircle. The front and top surfaces feature linear ventilation grilles. A single white cable with a blue connector extends from the top rear of the device, initially out of frame at the top. A red, weathered garage door with peeling paint forms the background, visible in the upper portion of the frame. The camera is positioned at ground level, looking down at the scene from a high angle, utilizing a shallow depth of field that initially focuses on the device in the foreground. As the device approaches the ground and begins to collide, the lower part of the casing becomes increasingly broken, with pieces of plastic falling off and exposing internal components and broken glass. The device then begins to tilt backward, causing the blue cable connector to swing down from the top center into the foreground. As a result, the device is now positioned in the middle ground, with its already broken base remaining in the bottom-center, exposing more internal components. The white cable with a blue connector at the back is in the process of descending. As the monitor is struck, a part of the device moves to the foreground and becomes blurred, while the focus remains on the main device, which is now in the midground.",

    "Camera": "This slow-motion video is captured from a static camera positioned at ground level, looking down at the scene from a high angle. The camera utilizes a shallow depth of field, initially focusing on the device in the foreground. As the monitor is struck, a part of the device moves to the foreground and becomes blurred, while the focus remains on the main device, which is now in the midground.",
    "Subject": "An old, off-white electronic device is shown sitting upright on a concrete surface. The device has a bulky, rectangular shape with the upper portion of the back being rectangular and the lower part near the ground curved, resembling a semicircle. The front and top surfaces feature linear ventilation grilles. A single white cable with a blue connector extends from the top rear of the device. The bottom portion of the device's plastic casing is severely damaged and broken, with shattered pieces of plastic scattered around its base, exposing some of its internal components.",
    "Motion": "The device approaches the ground and begins to collide, causing the lower part of the casing to become increasingly broken with pieces of plastic falling off. Eventually, the device's internal components are visible through the shattered casing. A white cable with a blue connector at the back is in the process of descending.",
    "Scene": "The video shows the back of an old, beige electronic device that appears to have fallen onto a concrete surface outdoors. The device's casing is cracked and shattered at the bottom, exposing internal components and broken glass. A white cable with a blue connector swings. In the background, a red, weathered garage door with peeling paint is visible.",
    "Spatial": "The video presents a full shot of an old electronic device, initially positioned upright and centered in the foreground on a concrete surface that occupies the bottom of the frame. A red garage door forms the background, visible in the upper portion of the frame. A white cable extends from the top rear of the device, its blue connector initially out of frame at the top. The device then begins to tilt backward, causing the blue cable connector to swing down from the top center into the foreground. As a result, the device is now positioned in the middle ground, with its already broken base remaining in the bottom-center, exposing more internal components. The camera is positioned at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
