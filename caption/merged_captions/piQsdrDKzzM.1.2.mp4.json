  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a light-skinned man with a full head of medium-length brown hair, a beard, and a mustache, standing in the center of the frame in the foreground of an indoor parking garage. He is wearing a black tank top and black pants, holding a knife in his right hand with the blade pointing downwards, and has a serious or intense expression. The parking garage is characterized by its concrete construction, with rectangular concrete pillars supporting the low ceiling, from which numerous pipes and fluorescent light fixtures are suspended. The concrete floor is marked with yellow painted lines, delineating parking spaces. The overall illumination is provided by these artificial lights, casting a utilitarian glow throughout the expansive, empty area. The man is positioned centrally in one of the wide lanes between rows of potential parking spots. Initially, his body is slightly turned to the right, but he adjusts his position so that both his head and body face directly towards the camera. The camera is at eye level and maintains a level angle, employing a shallow depth of field to keep the man in the foreground in focus. It exhibits smooth forward movement with minimal shaking, transitioning into a medium-full shot that shows him from the head to his thighs while he remains centered in the frame. The floor and ceiling of the parking garage extend from the middle ground to the background, with vertical pillars arranged in both the middle ground and background.",

    "Scene": "The scene unfolds in an indoor parking garage, characterized by its concrete construction. Rectangular concrete pillars support the low ceiling, from which numerous pipes and fluorescent light fixtures are suspended. The concrete floor is marked with yellow painted lines, delineating parking spaces. The overall illumination is provided by these artificial lights, casting a utilitarian glow throughout the expansive, empty area.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
