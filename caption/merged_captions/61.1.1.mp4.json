  "merged_caption": "The video maintains a static medium close-up shot of a man with dark skin, grey dreadlocks, and a grey goatee, wearing a light-colored, wide-brimmed hat, large, square, white-framed sunglasses, and a green collared shirt over a patterned undershirt. He is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground, and is speaking while subtly moving his head. His left hand, partially visible, makes small gestures as he talks. In the right foreground, a dark silhouette of another person's shoulder and head is visible, creating an over-the-shoulder POV. The background is dark and blurry, with indistinct figures and a wavy white neon light visible in the top left. Yellow subtitles appear at the bottom center, displaying the dialogue: \"Don't drool it\" \"Just lick it man. Come on.\" \"Dude\" \"Wet your finger\" and \"Danny: Damn, man!\" The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, employing a shallow depth of field with the focus set on the man in the midground. The camera remains fixed but exhibits slight unsteadiness, with no intentional movement. The setting is a dimly lit indoor environment, likely a bar or club at night.",

    "Scene": "An over-the-shoulder POV, where the camera is positioned behind a character whose dark silhouette occupies the right foreground, looks towards another individual in a dimly lit indoor setting, likely a bar or club at night. The person in focus wears a light-colored, wide-brimmed hat, large, white, square-framed sunglasses, and a green collared shirt over a patterned undershirt. They have grey dreadlocks and a grey goatee. The background is dark and blurry, with indistinct figures and a wavy white neon light visible. Yellow subtitles appear at the bottom of the screen, displaying the dialogue: \"Don't drool it\" \"Just lick it man. Come on.\" \"Dude\" \"Wet your finger\" and \"Danny: Damn, man!\"",

In the right foreground, a dark silhouette of another person's shoulder and head is visible.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
