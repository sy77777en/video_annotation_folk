  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a full shot of a small, yellow, bird-like creature with a large head, orange beak, round purple body, small yellow heart-shaped hands, and red feet, seated in the center middle ground on a green grassy field that spans the lower half of the frame. In the foreground, one broken toy-like object with a brown base and yellow top is at the bottom left, and another red with yellow legs is at the bottom right. The upper half shows a light blue sky with pale yellow cloud-like shapes in the background. The camera is initially static, then smoothly zooms out and trucks left, transitioning to a wide shot. This movement reveals a stationary white ambulance with a red stripe and cross, its back door open, in the left middle ground. Simultaneously, a bipedal, green alligator-like creature, wearing a white nurse's cap with a red cross and brown pants secured by a dark brown belt, runs in from the left, settling in the left-of-center middle ground. A small, grey raccoon-like creature, wearing an orange shirt, also enters from the left, positioning itself in the center middle ground. The yellow bird-like creature remains seated, now in the right-of-center middle ground. The camera is positioned at the subjects' height throughout, capturing the dynamics as the green alligator-like creature and the grey raccoon-like creature stand next to the yellow bird-like creature, indicating a possible emergency situation.",

    "Camera": "The camera is initially static, then smoothly zooms out and trucks left to reveal more characters and an ambulance entering the scene.",
    "Subject": "The video features a small, yellow, bird-like creature with a notably atypical appearance: it has a large head with an orange beak, a round purple body, small yellow heart-shaped hands, and red feet, and is shown sitting. Another prominent subject is a bipedal, green alligator-like creature, rendered unusual by its attire consisting of a white nurse's cap with a red cross and brown pants secured by a dark brown belt. A third character is a small, grey raccoon-like creature, whose atypical feature is an orange shirt, complementing its striped tail.",
    "Motion": "The yellow bird-like creature is initially seen sitting on a green grassy field with two fragments on the grass in front of it: one resembling a hammer with a dark brown head and a yellow handle, and the other a red and yellow fragment. The camera then zooms out and moves left, revealing the green alligator-like creature and the grey raccoon-like creature standing next to the yellow bird-like creature. An ambulance with an open door is parked nearby, indicating a possible emergency situation.",
    "Scene": "The scene unfolds in a simple, cartoonish outdoor environment, characterized by a flat, green grassy field beneath a light blue sky dotted with large, pale yellow, cloud-like shapes. A few lighter green and yellow patches are visible on the grass, where two small, broken toy-like objects—one with a brown base and yellow top, the other red with yellow legs—are scattered. A small, yellow, bird-like character is initially seated on this field. As the camera zooms out and pans left, a white ambulance marked with a red stripe and cross is revealed with its back door open. Concurrently, a green, alligator-like character in a nurse's cap and a small, grey raccoon-like character run onto the field from the same direction, heading towards the bird-like character.",
    "Spatial": "The video opens with a full shot. A yellow bird-like creature is seated in the center middle ground, on a green grassy field that spans the lower half of the frame. In the foreground, one broken toy-like object is at the bottom left, and another is at the bottom right. The upper half shows a light blue sky with pale yellow cloud-like shapes in the background. The scene transitions to a wide shot as the camera zooms out and pans left, revealing a stationary white ambulance with its back door open in the left middle ground. Simultaneously, a green alligator-like creature runs in from the left, settling in the left-of-center middle ground, while a small, grey raccoon-like creature also enters from the left, positioning itself in the center middle ground. The yellow bird-like creature remains seated, now in the right-of-center middle ground. Throughout the video, the camera is positioned at the subjects' height."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
