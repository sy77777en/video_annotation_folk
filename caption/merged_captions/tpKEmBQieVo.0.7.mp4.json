  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a first-person perspective, where the lower body of an individual in a bright yellow jacket with blue vertical accents and matching pants is positioned in the bottom center foreground. The jagged, rocky edge of a cliff occupies the foreground and extends into the background. Far below, an extreme wide shot of a sunlit valley with green patches and light-colored winding paths is visible in the background, filling the upper and central portions of the frame. The camera, mounted on a helmet, provides an aerial view relative to the ground while maintaining an eye-level perspective from the peak. Initially, the camera offers a bird's-eye view as the person looks down the cliff. The perspective starts motionless but unsteady. The individual, wearing shoes that resemble a jumpsuit, stands on the edge of the rocky cliff before moving forward, preparing to jump. As the individual leaps off the cliff, the perspective abruptly shifts as the viewpoint moves forward and plunges downwards. During this descent, the sheer, textured rock face of the cliff rushes upwards from the bottom, becoming the dominant element in the foreground and middle ground, largely obscuring the distant valley. The camera follows their descent with slight shaking, and the angle shifts to an upside-down high angle. The camera employs deep focus, keeping a large depth of field sharp. The sunlit valley far below unfolds, revealing patches of green vegetation and light-colored, winding paths or dry riverbeds traversing the grey and brown landscape. The jagged, multi-toned rock of the cliff edge is prominent, and the camera maintains a position at the subject's eye level throughout, capturing the rocky terrain of the cliff during the descent and offering a detailed view of the rugged landscape.",

    "Camera": "The video captures a first-person perspective with the camera mounted on a helmet at the mountain peak. It provides an aerial view relative to the ground while maintaining an eye-level perspective from the peak. Initially, the camera offers a bird's-eye view as the person looks down a cliff. Upon jumping, the angle shifts to an upside-down high angle. The camera employs deep focus, keeping a large depth of field sharp. The perspective starts motionless but unsteady, and as the person jumps off the cliff, the camera follows their descent with slight shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video offers a first-person viewpoint, displaying an individual from the chest down. This individual wears a bright yellow jacket with blue vertical accents on its front, along with matching bright yellow pants and shoes that resemble a jumpsuit. Only the individual's left hand is visible at the lower portion of the view. The individual stands on the edge of a rocky cliff before jumping off.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a first-person perspective showing the individual standing on a rocky cliff edge, with a vast mountainous landscape visible below. The individual, wearing a bright yellow jacket and matching pants, starts to move forward, preparing to jump. As the individual leaps off the cliff, the camera primarily captures the rocky terrain of the cliff during the descent, offering a detailed view of the rugged landscape.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, shows the viewer looking down from the precipice of a towering, rocky mountain, with a bright yellow jacket visible in the immediate foreground. Far below, a sunlit valley unfolds, revealing patches of green vegetation and light-colored, winding paths or dry riverbeds traversing the grey and brown landscape. The jagged, multi-toned rock of the cliff edge is prominent. The perspective then abruptly plunges downwards, rapidly descending along the sheer, textured rock face.",
    "Spatial": "The video opens with a first-person perspective, where the lower body of an individual in a yellow jumpsuit is positioned in the bottom center foreground.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
