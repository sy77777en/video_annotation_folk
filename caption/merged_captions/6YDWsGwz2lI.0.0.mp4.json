  "merged_caption": "This video captures a wide scenery shot from a high-angle perspective, filmed from a moving elevated train, likely the 'L' in Chicago. The camera initially looks down at the street, quickly and smoothly tilting up and shifting to the left, transitioning to a level, eye-level perspective. The scene unfolds within a dense urban environment under dim, overcast lighting, giving the cityscape a muted and atmospheric quality. The journey begins by passing through a station, with slightly unclear station architecture due to motion blur in the foreground. In the background, a building with a central, vertical red neon sign is visible. As the camera continues to move, the perspective opens up to reveal a long street canyon stretching into the distance, flanked by tall, classic-style buildings on both sides. Station signs for \"Washington/Wabash\" and \"Millennium Park\" briefly appear in the foreground before moving out of the shot. Another red neon sign, initially centered, shifts to the right side of the frame as the train progresses, while the view remains partially framed by the train's window and structural elements in the foreground. The deep focus keeps the entire urban scene sharp and clear, immersing the viewer in the scale and feeling of the city. The overcast sky casts a greenish, desaturated light over the scene, enhancing the moody atmosphere. As the train moves forward, light traffic, including a trolley, can be seen on the street below. There is no main subject in this shot; instead, the focus is on the urban environment and atmosphere, emphasizing the journey through the architectural landscape itself.",

    "Motion": "This video offers a scenic view from a moving elevated train, likely the 'L' in Chicago, as it travels through the city's downtown area. The perspective is from inside the train, looking out at the urban canyon formed by tall buildings. The dim, overcast lighting gives the cityscape a muted and atmospheric quality.",
    "Scene": "From the perspective of a moving elevated train, the scene unfolds within a dense urban environment under dim, overcast lighting. The journey begins by passing through a station, revealing a view down a street canyon formed by tall, multi-story buildings with numerous windows. A green sign for the \"Washington Wabash\" station and a blue sign for \"Millennium Park\" are briefly visible. On the street below, there is light traffic. A vertical red neon sign adorns the facade of one of the buildings. The overall color scheme is muted, with a prominent greenish-grey cast over the cityscape.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
