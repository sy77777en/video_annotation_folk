  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a humanoid figure in a white, long-sleeved top standing on the left side of the frame, its reflective, silver, featureless head and hands visible, and its arms crossed, resembling a mannequin. In the middle ground, wooden produce bins display sweet potatoes, red apples, and dark, round vegetables, while a coffee poster advertising a white mug for $1.99 occupies the background on the left, and a plain grey door with a small, completely dark rectangular window is on the right. The camera, at eye-level with a level-angle shot and deep focus, slightly shaky, trucks leftward, expanding the view to include a second humanoid figure in a grey, long-sleeved top with a collar and a tie, appearing on the left side of the frame. This figure also has a reflective, silver, featureless head and hands, and holds its arms out with open palms in a conversational gesture, resembling a mannequin. The final composition is a medium shot showing both figures in the foreground, with the grey figure on the left and the white figure on the right, both remaining entirely motionless. The produce bins span the middle ground, and the tiled wall with the poster forms the background. The camera remains at the subjects' level, framing the two humanlike figures as they interact in front of the produce bins.",

    "Camera": "This is an eye-level, level-angle shot with a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp. A slightly shaky camera moves leftward, stopping to frame the two humanlike figures as they converse.",
    "Subject": "A humanoid figure with a reflective, silver, featureless head and hands stands on the right, dressed in a white, long-sleeved top with its arms crossed. As the scene expands, a second humanoid figure appears on the left, facing the first. This figure is dressed in a grey, long-sleeved top featuring a collar and a tie, and also has a reflective, silver, featureless head and hands. It holds its arms out with its palms open in a conversational gesture.",
    "Motion": "A humanoid figure in a white top stands still with its arms crossed, resembling a mannequin. The camera trucks to the left, revealing a second humanoid figure in a grey top on the left. The grey figure, also resembling a mannequin, has its arms raised with open palms gesturing toward the first figure, both remaining entirely motionless.",
    "Scene": "An indoor scene is set in a market against a wall of white and red tiles. A large poster advertising coffee in a white mug for $1.99 hangs on the wall. Below the advertisement, wooden crates display various types of produce, including sweet potatoes, red apples, and dark, round vegetables. To the right of the produce stands a plain grey door with a small, completely dark rectangular window near the top. Two figures are seen interacting in front of the produce bins.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium shot of a humanoid figure in white standing on the left side of the frame. In the middle ground, wooden produce bins are visible, while a coffee poster occupies the background on the left and a grey door is on the right. The camera then trucks left, expanding the view to include a second humanoid figure in grey, who appears on the left side of the frame. The final composition is a medium shot showing both figures in the foreground, with the grey figure on the left and the white figure on the right. The produce bins span the middle ground, and the tiled wall with the poster forms the background. The camera remains at the subjects' level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
