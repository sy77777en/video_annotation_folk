  "merged_caption": "This is a wide shot of a cityscape scenery captured from an overhead-level, level-angle perspective on the Brooklyn Bridge. The steel structure and suspension cables of the bridge are positioned in the foreground and middle ground, framing the scene from the bottom, top, and sides, with only the upper center not framed by the bridge. From the camera's elevated position, blurred light streaks from traffic are visible in the bottom center of the frame, moving toward the viewer from the background into the middle ground. The camera smoothly and slowly zooms in toward the Manhattan skyline, maintaining a deep focus with a large depth of field throughout the shot. The movement of traffic is captured with a long exposure effect, transforming the vehicles' headlights and taillights into continuous, glowing streaks of red and white light that contrast with the city. To the right, a pedestrian walkway with a few figures is situated in both the foreground and middle ground, dwarfed by the immense scale of the bridge and the sprawling metropolis beyond. In the background, the Manhattan skyline extends across the center of the frame, set behind the bridge's structure. The skyscrapers of the city are silhouetted against a soft, pastel-hued sky, with lights visible in their windows. The scene is captured during the twilight hour, either at dawn or dusk, emphasizing the grand scale and bustling atmosphere of the urban environment.",

    "Camera": "This is a time-lapse video from an overhead-level, level-angle perspective on the Brooklyn Bridge. The camera smoothly and slowly zooms in toward the Manhattan skyline, maintaining a deep focus with a large depth of field throughout the shot.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a dynamic cityscape scenery shot captured from the Brooklyn Bridge, looking towards the Manhattan skyline during the twilight hour. There is no single main subject, as the composition emphasizes the grand scale and bustling atmosphere of the urban environment. The intricate steel structure and suspension cables of the bridge frame the scene, leading the eye towards the distant skyscrapers silhouetted against a soft, pastel-hued sky. Below, on the bridge's roadway, the movement of traffic is captured with a long exposure effect, transforming the vehicles' headlights and taillights into continuous, glowing streaks of red and white light that contrast with the city. Some people are visible on the elevated pedestrian walkway to the right, dwarfed by the immense scale of the bridge and the sprawling metropolis beyond.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenic shot from the Brooklyn Bridge, looking towards the Manhattan skyline at dawn or dusk. The traffic on the bridge is shown in motion, creating streaks of light from the vehicles' headlights and taillights. In the background, the city's skyscrapers are silhouetted against the colorful sky.",
    "Scene": "From a vantage point on the Brooklyn Bridge's pedestrian walkway at dawn or dusk, the Manhattan skyline is visible in the background. The bridge's steel structure, with its network of suspension cables, frames the view. Below, traffic flows in multiple lanes, the cars' lights creating long, blurred streaks of red and white. The skyscrapers of the city are silhouetted against a pink and orange sky, with lights visible in their windows. Some figures are visible on the elevated pedestrian walkway to the right.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
