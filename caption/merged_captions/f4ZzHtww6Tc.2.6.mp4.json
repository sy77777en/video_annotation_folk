  "merged_caption": "The video's framing of the main subject, a man with light brown skin wearing a black short-sleeved t-shirt with a small graphic on the chest, light blue jeans held up by a black belt, white high-top sneakers, a silver chain necklace, and a red baseball cap with a white logo, is dynamic, beginning with a full shot of him in the center middle ground. The man starts by skating and vaulting over the back of a public bench with his skateboard. The camera maintains a shallow depth of field to emphasize the skateboarder, panning left quickly to track him. As he moves behind another person seated in the left foreground, a tree briefly obscures him. The subject is then repositioned in a medium-full shot in the center middle ground, with a building visible in the background featuring the words \"HOTEL GEORGIA\" in large, gold-colored letters. The scene transitions to a full shot that tracks the subject from right to left across the middle ground as he skates over another bench and rides his skateboard across a sunlit urban plaza, furnished with red metal chairs and brown wooden benches, interspersed with small trees. The camera tilts down slightly to focus on his lower body as he jumps down a small set of concrete stairs in the center, then tilts back up to reveal his whole body again. A tree briefly passes through the right foreground. The sequence ends with a medium-full shot of the subject from behind in the left middle ground, moving past a black SUV in traffic. Throughout the video, pedestrians and traffic, including a yellow taxi and other cars, occupy the middle ground and background, and the camera remains at the subject's level.",

    "Camera": "The camera maintains a shallow depth of field to emphasize the skateboarder in the middle ground, ensuring they remain the central point of interest. The slightly unsteady camera pans left quickly to track the skateboarder, and midway through the shot, it tilts down slightly to focus on their lower body as they jump down the stairs, then tilts back up to reveal their whole body again.",
    "Subject": "The video features a man with light brown skin as the main subject.

    "Motion": "A man begins by skating and vaulting over the back of a public bench with his skateboard. He then skates over another bench before riding his skateboard across a plaza. He jumps down a small set of stairs and continues along the sidewalk, skating past a black SUV in traffic.",
    "Scene": "A sunlit urban plaza is situated next to a busy city street, with a prominent building in the background featuring the words \"HOTEL GEORGIA\" in large, gold-colored letters. The public square is furnished with red metal chairs and brown wooden benches, interspersed with small trees. A skateboarder navigates the paved area, moving past a blue, black, and yellow recycling bin and down a short flight of concrete stairs in the middle ground. Some trunks and aman wears black shirt with hat sit on the chair in the foreground,watching the man skating.Pedestrians stroll through the scene, while a black SUV, a yellow taxi, and other cars stop along the adjacent road.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
