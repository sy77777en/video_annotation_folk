  "merged_caption": "A full shot centers on a Black man with a shaved head standing in the center foreground of the frame, wearing a long-sleeved sweater with a black and white checkerboard pattern, blue jeans, and dark shoes. He is positioned between two large, light-colored concrete pillars, with a green metal gate directly behind him. A silver-colored chain is visible around his neck, and a set of keys hangs from his belt loop. The scene is set in an outdoor urban environment during the day, illuminated by sunlight that casts shadows on the ground and creates a slight blur effect in the background. Signs are mounted on both pillars, with the one on the right featuring a CCTV camera icon and text, and a sign on the gate indicating that pets are prohibited. Beyond the gate, manicured green hedges line a path leading toward a modern, multi-story residential building in the background. Initially, the man stands with his hands hanging naturally at his sides. As he begins to sing, he performs a series of movements: crossing his hands in front of his body, swinging them, lowering them, and finally holding his right arm across his chest while extending his left arm straight forward. The camera, positioned at a hip-level, smoothly arcs clockwise around the man, maintaining a deep focus and consistent central framing throughout the shot.",

    "Scene": "In an outdoor urban setting during the day, a man in a black-and-white checkered sweater and blue jeans stands on a paved area in front of a green metal gate. The gate is set between two large, light-colored concrete pillars. Signs are mounted on both pillars, with the one on the right featuring a CCTV camera icon and text, and a sign on the gate indicating that pets are prohibited. Beyond the gate, manicured green hedges line a path leading toward a modern, multi-story residential building in the background.

    "Spatial": "A full shot centers on a man standing in the center foreground of the frame. He is positioned between two large concrete pillars, with a metal gate directly behind him. Behind the gate, a path bordered by hedges is situated in the middle ground. In the background, trees and a multi-story modern building are visible. The camera moves in a clockwise direction around the man, maintaining a consistent central framing throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
