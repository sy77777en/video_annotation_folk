  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of an empty tiled room, featuring three glowing vertical windows positioned in the background, with the camera at eye level. The walls are covered in white tiles, with a dark horizontal strip across the center. The camera, captured from a first-person point of view in a 3D game and exhibiting mild barrel distortion, quickly tilts down and pans right, transitioning to a high-angle view of an indoor swimming pool area. This movement is very smooth, and the camera maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field throughout. The pool, located in the background, is partially beneath a white spiral staircase with metallic railings, positioned in the middle ground and descending into the background. The teal water of the pool is visible, with a small rubber duck floating near the edge in the bottom center of the frame. The surrounding walls and floor are covered in white square tiles, and several white cylindrical pillars are present in the background. The area beneath the staircase appears to be filled with water, and a small, yellow object is floating in it. The focus is on the clean, minimalist architectural design and the serene atmosphere of the aquatic space.",

    "Subject": "The video begins by capturing an empty room before the camera pans to the right and tilts downward, transitioning to focus on an interior architectural scenery shot of a swimming pool area. The pool, filled with rippling teal water, is partially encircled by a white spiral staircase featuring a metallic railing. The surrounding walls and floor are covered in white square tiles. A small rubber duck floats in the water, adding a playful touch to the scene. The focus is on the clean, minimalist architectural design and the serene atmosphere of the aquatic space.",
    "Motion": "This video shows a scene with a white spiral staircase. The area beneath the staircase appears to be filled with water, and a small, yellow object is floating in it. The surrounding walls and floor are covered in white tiles.",
    "Scene": "The video begins in a tiled room featuring three glowing vertical windows. The walls are covered in white tiles on both the upper and lower sections, with a dark textured strip running horizontally across the middle. The scene then transitions to an indoor, brightly lit space with a white, spiral staircase featuring silver metal railings. The staircase descends towards a pool of teal-colored water at its base. The surrounding walls and floor are covered in small, white square tiles. Several white cylindrical pillars are present in the space. A small, yellow, fake duck is visible floating in the water near the edge of the pool.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
