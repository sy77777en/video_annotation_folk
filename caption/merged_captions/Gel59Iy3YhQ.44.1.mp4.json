  "merged_caption": "The video features a wide shot with a side-view perspective, smoothly tracking a pixelated character as it runs rightward across a dark purple, metallic-looking bridge that extends horizontally across the frame's mid-section. The character, clad in a yellow-green garment and red pants, with a face featuring a yellow cross-shaped design, is consistently positioned in the center of the frame. As it moves, a blue vertical beam of light appears from beneath its feet, and a bat-shaped bird flies upwards out of this beam. Simultaneously, a blue, glowing potion in a clear, round-bottomed flask on a platform to the left gradually disappears, while a table with chemistry lab equipment materializes on the right side of the screen. The background showcases a large, luminous full moon in the top left and a bright, nebula-like formation from the center to the top right, set against a teal and purple, star-speckled night sky. Below the bridge, dark, indistinct structures and hanging vines are present. Overlay elements include a heads-up display at the bottom of the screen showing ability icons: a bomb symbol, a blue jagged lightning bolt, a blue wind-shaped tail with a red wind pattern, a stylized brown-and-white owl head, a red-and-black bullet-shaped icon, and a purple crossbow symbol. A green health bar, numerical resource counters, and a larger health bar (2879/6427) are visible in the bottom center. The bottom right displays icons for a green key, a brown block, a blue gem (103), and an orange coin (327), along with a timer (around 40m 04s), a number 5, and a mini-map depicting a red room.",

    "Camera": "The camera smoothly tracks a character from the side as it moves rightward across the screen.",
    "Subject": "A pixelated character, moving towards the right side of the frame, features a face with a yellow cross-shaped design, likely representing its eye. The upper body is clad in a yellow-green garment, possibly armor, while the lower body wears red pants. As the character runs, two red and yellow striped ribbons trail behind from the neck area. As it crosses a bridge, a blue vertical beam of light emerges from beneath its feet, from which a bat-shaped bird flies out. On the left side of the frame, a blue, glowing potion in a clear, round-bottomed flask gradually disappears. Meanwhile, on the right side, a table with a set of chemistry lab equipment appears. In the lower-left corner of the screen, several square icons are displayed: the first icon on the left is a bomb symbol; the second is a blue jagged lightning bolt; the third is a blue wind-shaped tail with a red wind pattern; the fourth is a stylized brown-and-white owl head; the fifth is a red-and-black bullet-shaped icon; and the sixth is a purple crossbow symbol.",
    "Motion": "The pixelated character runs to the right across a bridge. As it moves, a blue vertical beam of light appears from beneath its feet, and a bird flies upwards out of this beam. Simultaneously, a blue potion in a flask on a platform to the left exits the frame, while a table with chemistry lab equipment appears on the right side of the screen.",
    "Scene": "A gaming video with a side-view perspective of the character shows an outdoor scene at night. A large, luminous full moon dominates the teal and purple, star-speckled sky, which also features a distant, bright, nebula-like formation. The foreground features a dark purple, metallic-looking bridge or walkway with a simple railing, upon which a small, pixelated character in red pants and a top is running. Below the bridge, dark, indistinct structures and hanging vines are present. To the left, on a platform, sits a glowing blue potion. Overlay elements include a heads-up display at the bottom of the screen showing ability icons (a blue arrow-shaped element, an owl, a purple crossbow), a green health bar, and numerical resource counters. In the bottom center is a larger health bar (2879/6427). The bottom right displays icons for a green key, a brown block, a blue gem (103), and an orange coin (327), along with a timer (around 40m 04s), a number 5, and a mini-map depicting a red room.",
    "Spatial": "The video features a wide shot with a side-view perspective. A pixelated character is consistently positioned in the center of the frame, moving rightwards along a dark purple, metallic-looking bridge that extends horizontally across the frame's mid-section. As the character progresses, a blue potion on a platform on the left gradually disappears, while chemistry lab equipment on a table materializes on the right. Concurrently, a blue vertical beam of light emanates from beneath the character on the bridge, with a bird ascending upwards from it. The background showcases a large, luminous moon in the top left, and a bright, nebula-like formation from the center to the top right. Dark, indistinct structures and hanging vines are present below the bridge. User interface elements, including ability icons, health bars, and resource counters, are overlaid at the bottom left and bottom center, while a mini-map, timer, and other icons are at the bottom right of the screen."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
