  "merged_caption": "This is an extreme wide shot of a nighttime cityscape scenery, capturing a scenic night view of the River Seine in Paris. The Seine River flows from the foreground through the center of the frame, leading toward the iconic Notre Dame Cathedral, which is positioned in the center background and illuminated against the dark sky. The river is flanked by illuminated multi-story traditional buildings with glowing windows on the left and right sides, extending from the foreground into the middle ground, and bordered by light-colored stone embankments. A bridge spans the river in the middle ground, in front of the cathedral. The city lights from the buildings and street lamps cast a beautiful, shimmering reflection on the dark surface of the river. A series of five brightly lit tour boats, decorated with blue lights, travels consecutively along the river from the bottom right foreground toward the center, passing under the bridge and creating a motion blur with their movement. The video appears to be a time-lapse, as the boats create a motion-blurred streak of blue light, adding dynamism to the scene rather than being its primary focus. The camera is captured from a steady, level-angle position above the water, utilizing a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. It smoothly moves rightward at bridge level, parallel to the scene, enhancing the collective visual experience and mood of the location. A text overlay in the bottom right corner reads \"MATHIEU STANIĆ CINEMATOGRAPHER\".",

    "Subject": "The video presents a nighttime cityscape scenery shot, focusing on capturing the overall environment, atmosphere, and scale of the Parisian scene along the River Seine at night. The composition encompasses the river reflecting numerous lights, bordered by illuminated stone embankments and multi-story traditional buildings with glowing windows. In the distance, the iconic Notre Dame Cathedral is prominently featured, illuminated against the dark sky near a bridge. Five brightly lit tour boats with blue decorative lights travel consecutively along the water, passing under the bridge and adding dynamism to the scene rather than being its primary focus. The emphasis is on the collective visual experience and mood of the location rather than highlighting one specific element.",

    "Scene": "This nighttime scene captures the Seine River in Paris, with the illuminated Notre Dame Cathedral visible in the distance beyond a stone arch bridge. The river flows between light-colored stone embankments, which are lined with multi-story buildings featuring lit windows and yellow streetlights. Five long tour boats, decorated with blue lights, travel consecutively along the water, passing under the bridge and creating a blur with their movement. The various city lights cast shimmering reflections on the dark surface of the river. A text overlay in the bottom right corner reads \"MATHIEU STANIĆ CINEMATOGRAPHER\".",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
