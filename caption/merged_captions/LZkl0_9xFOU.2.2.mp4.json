  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a full shot of a small, black, boxy monitor in the right foreground, displaying the green-tinted original Xbox dashboard with options like \"MEMORY,\" \"MUSIC,\" \"XBOX LIVE,\" and \"SETTINGS\" surrounding a large, translucent green Xbox logo. In the left background, a black Xbox console and a large, black original Xbox controller are visible but out of focus. The scene is set in a dimly lit indoor environment dominated by a green color scheme, with black elements created by shadows. The camera begins with a static, level-angle shot focused on the monitor, then moves left and gently forward, performing a rack focus to shift the focus from the monitor to the now-floating Xbox \"Duke\" controller in the midground. Approximately two seconds into the video, the controller and the console, to which it appears to be connected, lift off the ground and begin to float. The controller, now in sharp focus in the left midground, features a prominent, glowing yellow and green \"XBOX\" logo at its center. Meanwhile, the monitor transitions to being out of focus in the right foreground, and the console remains blurred in the left background. The camera maintains a smooth, level-angle shot with a shallow depth of field throughout the sequence, capturing the dynamic shift in focus and movement of the controller and console.",

    "Camera": "This is a smooth, level-angle shot with a shallow depth of field. The video begins with a static camera focused on a small CRT monitor in the foreground displaying the original Xbox dashboard. The camera then begins to move left and gently forward, simultaneously performing a rack focus to shift the focus from the monitor to the original Xbox \"Duke\" controller in the midground.",
    "Subject": "The video opens with a focused view of a small, black, boxy monitor displaying the green-tinted original Xbox dashboard. The menu, featuring options like \"MEMORY,\" \"MUSIC,\" \"XBOX LIVE,\" and \"SETTINGS,\" surrounds a large, translucent green Xbox logo. In the blurred background, a black Xbox console is partially visible. The focus then smoothly shifts from the monitor to a large, black original Xbox controller, which appears to float in the midground. The controller has a prominent, glowing yellow and green \"XBOX\" logo at its center, while the monitor in front of it goes out of focus and the console remains out of focus throughout the video.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a static shot focused on a small monitor, positioned in front of a controller and a console, all resting on the same surface. Approximately two seconds into the video, the controller and the console, to which it appears to be connected, lift off the ground and begin to float. As the camera moves to the left and slightly forward, the focus smoothly shifts from the monitor to the now-floating controller, leaving the monitor and console in the background out of focus.",
    "Scene": "In a dimly lit indoor setting, the scene is dominated by a green color scheme, with black elements created by shadows. An original Xbox console and controller are displayed. In the foreground, a small, boxy monitor with a green-tinted screen shows the classic Xbox dashboard menu, featuring a large, translucent green logo and options for \"MEMORY,\" \"MUSIC,\" \"XBOX LIVE,\" and \"SETTINGS.\" To the left, the black console and a large, black original Xbox controller are visible, with the controller's central logo illuminated.",
    "Spatial": "The video opens with a full shot of a small monitor in the right foreground, which is in focus. In the left background, an Xbox console and controller are visible but out of focus. The camera's focus then smoothly shifts from the foreground monitor to the controller. The shot becomes a full shot of the Xbox controller, now in sharp focus in the left midground. The monitor transitions to being out of focus in the right foreground, while the console remains blurred in the left background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout the sequence."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
