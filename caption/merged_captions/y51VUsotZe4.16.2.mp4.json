  "merged_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot, with a woman with dark, shoulder-length hair positioned in the right foreground, her profile facing her left as she actively eats noodles, some of which are visible in her mouth. She wears a dark purple, patterned top and has wide eyes. The camera is positioned at eye level, employing a high angle with a shallow depth of field, focusing on the woman eating. The camera remains fixed but exhibits slight shaking at the subject's level throughout the shot, with mild barrel distortion. A small, white-topped table is visible in the center-left middle ground, with a stool in the middle ground. In the left background, two men are seated at a table; one wears a dark collared shirt, and the other a dark jacket over a dark shirt. Further to their right, in the center background, two more men are seated at another table; one in a dark-colored shirt and the other in a reddish-brown collared shirt. A fifth person, likely male, in a dark top is visible in the more distant center-left background. The scene unfolds indoors within a small restaurant, characterized by a pervasive, strong green artificial light that casts a dark ambiance over the setting. The floor is tiled with a geometric pattern, and the space is furnished with small, white-topped tables on dark legs, accompanied by simple stools. Simple white sofas are located on the left side of the scene. In the background, other patrons are visible at their tables, and the wall features shelves stocked with items. A counter area with shelves occupies the top-left to top-center background, while a tiled floor extends from the bottom of the frame into the background. The clock is positioned on the signboard. The woman in the foreground chews noodles, her mouth moving as she eats, while the men in the background remain seated and largely still.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
