  "merged_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of the Colosseum's interior, focusing on the architectural scenery rather than any specific subject. From a level-angle, aerial perspective, the camera captures the vast ruins, with the exposed, vegetated crypt occupying the lower part of the frame, extending from the foreground to the midground. A modern wooden platform, positioned near the lower center, extends inward above the exposed crypt, visually connecting the lower and middle parts of the scene. Multi-layered arched walls and arcades encircle the frame, occupying the upper center, forming an arc-shaped boundary, with a hint of sky visible above. The camera performs a slightly unsteady counterclockwise arc movement with a slight tightening of the framing, with the visual center transitioning smoothly from right to left, slightly expanding the field of view while maintaining a generally stable height and proportion. This greatly accelerated time-lapse video is captured from an aerial, level-angle perspective. Using a deep focus that keeps the entire structure sharp, the camera performs a slightly unsteady counterclockwise arc around the interior of the Colosseum. The weathered, tan-colored stone structure features multiple tiers of arched openings and seating areas, with the upper walls showing rectangular windows against the gray sky. The overcast sky casts a soft, even light over the weathered brown and grey stone, enhancing the monument's ancient and timeworn atmosphere. Tourists, appearing small in comparison to the massive stone walls, can be seen walking along the remaining pathways and gathered on a modern wooden platform that extends over a portion of the exposed lower level. The soft, diffused daylight filtering through the clouds gradually shifts the scene's tone from warm to cool as the video progresses.",

    "Subject": "This video presents an architectural scenery shot, offering a sweeping view of the interior of the Colosseum in Rome. There is no single main subject, as the focus is on conveying the immense scale and historical grandeur of the ancient amphitheater. The camera moves in a counterclockwise arc inside the vast, ruined structure, revealing its elliptical shape and multiple tiers of arched corridors. Much of the original arena floor is missing, exposing the intricate network of subterranean tunnels and chambers of the hypogeum below, now overgrown with patches of green grass. Tourists, appearing small in comparison to the massive stone walls, can be seen walking along the remaining pathways and gathered on a modern wooden platform that extends over a portion of the exposed lower level. The overcast sky casts a soft, even light over the weathered brown and grey stone, enhancing the monument's ancient and timeworn atmosphere.",
    "Motion": "This scenery shot captures a sweeping view of the interior of the Colosseum in Rome. The camera moves in a counterclockwise arc inside the vast, ruined amphitheater, showcasing its multiple levels and the tourists scattered throughout. There is no primary subject motion, as the focus is on the grand, historic architecture.",
    "Scene": "An expansive view from within the Colosseum in Rome reveals the ancient amphitheater's ruined interior under an overcast sky. The weathered, tan-colored stone structure features multiple tiers of arched openings and seating areas, with the upper walls showing rectangular windows against the gray sky. A modern, light-colored wooden platform reconstructs a section of the arena floor, standing over the exposed hypogeum—a complex network of stone-lined underground chambers where green vegetation grows. Numerous small figures of tourists can be seen walking on the platform and along the upper-level walkways. The soft, diffused daylight filtering through the clouds gradually shifts the scene's tone from warm to cool as the video progresses.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
