  "merged_caption": "A close-up shot centers on a man in a gray suit with a white shirt and a patterned tie, identified as Robert Kardashian, who occupies the foreground. He has medium-length dark hair with a small patch of gray at the front and a focused expression, suggesting he is engaged in a serious activity. Initially, he is looking down while speaking, then raises his head slightly and looks forward. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, focusing on him using a shallow depth of field and remains completely static throughout the shot. To his left and slightly behind him in the middle ground, another man is partially visible, dressed in a light blue collared shirt. On the right side of the frame, also in the middle ground, a man with a beard and long hair, wearing a white cap backwards and a casual white shirt, raises a camera into a shooting position, indicating a press or public event. The background is a well-lit indoor setting with a light-colored wall, contributing to a neutral atmosphere, suggesting a formal or professional gathering likely during the daytime. The main subject's demeanor and attire contrast with the more casual appearance of the secondary subjects, highlighting his central role. A non-diegetic text overlay displaying the name \"Robert Kardashian\" in white letters on a black background is located in the bottom right of the frame.",

    "Subject": "The video features a man in a gray suit with a white shirt and a patterned tie, who appears to be the main subject. He has medium-length dark hair with a small patch of gray at the front and a focused expression, suggesting he is engaged in a serious activity, possibly speaking or reading. To his left, a man with a beard and long hair, wearing a white cap backwards and a casual white shirt, holds a camera, indicating he is capturing the event. Another man, partially visible, stands behind the main subject, dressed in a light blue collared shirt, adding to the sense of a public or press event. The main subject's demeanor and attire contrast with the more casual appearance of the secondary subjects, highlighting his central role.",
    "Motion": "The video shows a man in a gray suit with a white shirt and a patterned tie, identified as Robert Kardashian, speaking while looking down. He then raises his head slightly and looks forward. The background is a well-lit indoor setting with other individuals present, including a man in a white cap and a camera, indicating a press or public event.",
    "Scene": "The video captures a formal or professional gathering, likely indoors, as suggested by the well-lit scene that indicates daytime. The background features a light-colored wall, contributing to a neutral atmosphere. A person in a gray suit is prominently positioned in the foreground, indicating a central focus. The suit is complemented by a patterned tie, adding a touch of color. In the middle ground, other individuals are present, one of whom holds a camera, suggesting a press or media event. The video includes overlay text displaying the name \"Robert Kardashian\" in white letters on a black background at the bottom right, which is not part of the scene itself.",
    "Spatial": "A close-up shot centers on a man in a gray suit who occupies the foreground. To his left and slightly behind him in the middle ground, another man is partially visible. On the right side of the frame, also in the middle ground, a man in a white cap raises a camera into a shooting position. As this happens, the main subject, who was initially looking down, lifts his head to look forward. The camera remains static at the subjects' eye level throughout the shot. A non-diegetic text overlay is located in the bottom right of the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
