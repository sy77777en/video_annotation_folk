  "merged_caption": "In a close-up, slow-motion shot, an illuminated incandescent light bulb in a black socket is fixed in the center foreground. A pointed tool descends from the top center of the frame, penetrating the bulb. Upon impact, the bulb shatters, sending shards of glass and sparks exploding outward from the center, occupying the foreground and middle ground. The camera remains stationary and is positioned at the subject's level, employing a shallow depth of field to keep the light bulb in sharp focus. This video features a speed ramp effect, transitioning from slow motion to regular speed. As the glass fragments disperse, sparks fly from the exposed, glowing filament. In the middle ground, the upper body of a person is visible directly behind the central action, with their chest and lower face partially visible, wearing a white t-shirt and their mouth slightly agape. The background is extremely blurry, with indistinct patches of green, blue, and beige, making specific elements indiscernible. The clear, lit incandescent light bulb is shown at the moment of impact, shattering in slow motion. The bulb, screwed into a black socket, has a brightly glowing orange filament at its center. Two knives are seen penetrating the top of the glass, causing the bulb to explode into a cloud of flying glass shards and small particles. As the glass breaks apart, sparks fly from the exposed, still-glowing filament. The filament flashes brightly and then breaks as the glass disintegrates.",

    "Motion": "In slow motion, a sharp object descends and strikes the top of a lit incandescent light bulb. Upon impact, the glass bulb shatters, sending shards flying outwards. As the glass fragments disperse, sparks fly from the exposed, glowing filament.",
    "Scene": "In a close-up, slow-motion sequence, an illuminated incandescent light bulb seated in a black socket is pierced from above by a pointed metal tool. The clear glass bulb, glowing with a warm orange light from its filament, shatters violently. Shards of glass and fine particles are sent flying outward, suspended in mid-air. The filament flashes brightly and then breaks as the glass disintegrates. In the out-of-focus background, a person wearing a white shirt is partially visible.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
