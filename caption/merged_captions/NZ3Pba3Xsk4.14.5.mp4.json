  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a small rectangular window positioned in the left-center of the frame, with a small red panda with reddish-brown fur and a bushy ringed tail visible behind the glass in the middle ground, slightly above the camera’s initial height. The camera is angled upward from below the window frame. The red panda moves downward within its enclosure, visible through the window. As the camera, positioned at eye level, starts moving forward, it continuously pans left to explore the zoo view, with slightly unsteady movement and some shaking. The shot transitions to a wide shot that reveals the landscaped zoo enclosure, bordered by a textured, light brown wall with a large window reflecting trees and wooden structures. In this wider view, the window moves out of frame to the right, and the scene opens to show the garden area occupying most of the frame, with a well-maintained grassy lawn, scattered rocks, small trees, and shrubs in the middle ground. The black metal staircase with wooden steps appears in the center-right within the middle ground. The beige fence with horizontal slats and a sign featuring a photo of a red panda, alongside signs with yellow, black, and blue backgrounds, as well as a QR code, is visible in the middle ground, spanning the upper left and center of the frame. Numerous residential buildings are beyond the brown fence in the background. Two adults, dressed in casual clothing of various colors and styles, appear standing near the bottom in the middle ground, at eye level with the camera, looking down at something in their hands and not interacting with the red panda or each other. Towards the end, a yellow sign hanging on the distant wall becomes visible. The environment is bright, indicating daytime, and the sky is clear, allowing sunlight to illuminate the greenery and cast soft shadows across the scene. Deep focus is used, keeping all elements in the scene sharp.",

    "Camera": "The handheld camera is positioned at eye level, beginning with a static shot at a level angle. The camera starts moving forward, continuously panning left to explore the zoo view, with slightly unsteady movement and some shaking. Deep focus is used, keeping all elements in the scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "A small red panda with reddish-brown fur and a bushy ringed tail is visible through a rectangular window, though its features are somewhat obscured by the glass and reflections. As the view shifts, two adults appear, dressed in casual clothing of various colors and styles, both standing and looking down at something in their hands. The red panda is visible from inside a room, separated from the adults by the window.",
    "Motion": "The red panda moves downward within its enclosure, visible through the window. The two adults stand outside the enclosure, looking down at something in their hands and not interacting with the red panda or each other.",
    "Scene": "The video takes place outdoors in a landscaped garden area bordered by a textured, light brown wall with a large window reflecting trees and wooden structures. The setting features a well-maintained grassy lawn with scattered rocks, small trees, and shrubs, as well as a black metal staircase with wooden steps leading upward. A beige fence with horizontal slats encloses the area, and as the camera moves, a sign featuring a photo of a red panda can be seen on the fence, alongside signs with yellow, black, and blue backgrounds, as well as a QR code. Towards the end, a yellow sign hanging on the distant wall becomes visible. The environment is bright, indicating daytime, and the sky is clear, allowing sunlight to illuminate the greenery and cast soft shadows across the scene.",

The camera’s height transitions from below the window to a level angle, eye-level position as it completes the pan, with slight unsteadiness and some shaking, providing a dynamic perspective on the enclosure and its elements."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
