  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot of an interior space, captured from an eye-level perspective. The shot begins in a storage room, with a white shelving unit in the left foreground and another in the right foreground. A window, positioned in the middle ground, shows a green landscape in the background. The camera, filmed from a smooth, eye-level perspective with a level angle, focuses on the foreground and middleground, keeping the entire room sharp while the background, like the forest outside the window, is blurred. The camera then moves steadily down and to the right, smoothly transitioning the view into an adjoining bedroom. Overlay text appears in the bottom left corner of the frame. In the final framing, a wooden bed occupies the left middle ground, while a wooden desk and chair are positioned in the right middle ground. The window is now located at the top center of the frame in the middle ground, above the bed. This video showcases a digitally rendered room with wood-paneled walls, empty white shelving units, and a simple bedroom setup featuring a single bed and a desk. A window reveals a green, tree-lined landscape that shifts to the left of the frame, suggesting the room is inside a train carriage moving to the right. The first room is a storage area containing four white metal shelving units with wooden shelves, with two units on both the left and right walls. A window on the back wall provides a view of a green, grassy area with several trees. The camera then moves to reveal a bedroom, which includes a single wooden bed with white bedding and a matching wooden desk and chair. A window is positioned above and to the right of the bed, centered on the wall, showing the same outdoor view of the trees and green landscape.",

    "Subject": "This video presents an interior scenery shot, moving through a series of simply furnished rooms. The camera glides from a storage area, featuring white-framed shelves with wooden surfaces against wood-paneled walls, into an adjoining bedroom. This second room contains a simple wooden bed with white linens and a matching wooden desk and chair. A small window offers a view of green trees against a grassy landscape. The shot lacks a main subject, as the focus is placed on the overall environment, showcasing the minimalist and utilitarian design of the wood-paneled interior.",

    "Scene": "The video presents two different interior rooms, both featuring wood-paneled walls and a grey floor. The first room is a storage area containing four white metal shelving units with wooden shelves, with two units on both the left and right walls. A window on the back wall provides a view of a green, grassy area with several trees. The camera then moves to reveal a bedroom, which includes a single wooden bed with white bedding and a matching wooden desk and chair.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
