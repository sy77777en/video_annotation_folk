  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a dynamic shot where the camera moves backward, tilts upward, pans left, and shifts right. A red, featureless human figure is positioned in the left-center of the frame and in the middle ground of a parking lot. The figure, with a male build, stands next to a row of older-model sedans, holding its right arm with its left hand in a self-hugging gesture. The camera, in a slow-motion, eye-level shot, features a smooth, slow movement, starting from a high angle and tilting up to a level angle while moving backward, to the right, and panning left, leading the red figure through the parking lot. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. To the figure's left, a row of cars is arranged diagonally, receding from the foreground to the background. A black car and a portion of a white car occupy the right foreground, with the white sedan's headlights illuminated and shining brightly. A light green car is in the center middle ground beside the figure, and two other dark cars are visible further back in the left middle ground and background. The parking lot is marked with white lines on dark asphalt, and the late afternoon sunlight creates long shadows and casts a bright glare on the glossy surfaces of the cars. The red figure subtly shifts its weight between its feet while walking forward. An overlay of white text is present at the bottom left of the screen, reading \"[2,3].\"",

    "Subject": "In a parking lot, a solid red, featureless human figure with a male build stands next to a row of older-model sedans. The figure is entirely monochromatic red, obscuring any clothing or facial details. It is positioned with its body slightly turned, holding its right arm with its left hand in a self-hugging gesture. To the figure's left, in the foreground, is the front of a white sedan with its headlights illuminated and shining brightly. Behind the white car is a dark black vehicle, and behind that is the pale green sedan.and two other dark-colored sedans are visible parked further down the row.",

    "Scene": "In an outdoor parking lot during late afternoon, a row of vintage sedans is parked on dark asphalt marked with white lines. The sunlight creates long shadows and casts a bright glare on the glossy surfaces of the cars, which include a black vehicle and a portion of a white car in the foreground, with a light blue-green one behind them. A solid red, human-like figure stands between two of the cars. An overlay of white text is present at the bottom left of the screen, reading \"[2,3].\"",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
