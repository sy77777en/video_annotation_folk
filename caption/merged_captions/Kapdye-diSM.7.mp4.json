  "merged_caption": "This wide shot is captured from a moving vehicle, providing a dynamic view of a city street. Initially, the rear of a blue car is visible in the bottom right foreground. In the middle ground, a white van, a dark sedan, and a white SUV are parked in a line from right to center along the right side of the road. Tall, ornate buildings are present on both the right and left sides of the frame, as well as in the background. As the camera advances, the blue car in the bottom-right foreground moves out of the frame, replaced by a different black SUV in the bottom left foreground. Throughout the shot, the buildings scroll past on both sides, and a text overlay remains fixed in the bottom right corner. The unsteady, eye-level video is filmed from a high angle that levels out as the camera tilts slightly upward. The camera then moves forward and pans left, capturing the street scene. A deep focus is maintained throughout, keeping the cars and buildings in the background sharp. The perspective moves slowly down a city street during the day, flanked by tall, ornate buildings constructed from light-colored stone, featuring numerous windows and black flags hanging from poles. The paved street is marked with white lines for parking, where several vehicles, including a dark sedan, a black SUV, a white van, a white convertible, and a white SUV, are parked along the street on either side. Green trees are interspersed along the sidewalk. The scene captures a typical urban environment with a mix of modern and classic architecture, and the cars are the primary subjects, showcasing a variety of colors and styles. The scene is presented with a red and white text overlay in the bottom right corner that reads \"the STRADMAN\".",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
