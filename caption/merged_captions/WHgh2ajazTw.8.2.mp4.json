  "merged_caption": "This video features a medium shot of a plus-size woman with light skin and dark, wet, curly hair pulled back in a ponytail, positioned in the center of the frame and in the foreground. She is shown from the chest up, wearing a white bikini top, and appears out of breath with a flushed face and a focused, strained expression. The setting is an unpaved dirt path during the daytime, flanked by dense green trees and foliage. Sunlight filters through the leaves, casting a soft light on the scene, which has a muted, warm color palette, giving it a slightly faded appearance. The woman is on the path, visible at the bottom of the frame, which is flanked by trees and foliage in the background on the left and right. Breathing heavily, she fumbles with a light-colored, short-sleeved t-shirt before lifting it and struggling to pull it over her head. She leans forward and down, continuing to pull the shirt down over her torso, on top of her bikini top, with strained effort. Throughout the clip, the woman remains centrally framed as the camera maintains a stable, eye-level perspective with a slight handheld shake, keeping her as the consistent focal point. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the focus on the woman in the foreground.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
