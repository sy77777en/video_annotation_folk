  "merged_caption": "In a static medium close-up shot, a middle-aged man with a bald head and light skin, wearing a light blue button-up shirt, is centered in the frame, visible from the chest up. He is seated on a brown leather couch that extends across the bottom of the screen, positioned in the foreground of a rustic, well-lit room with wooden walls. The camera is at eye level with a level angle, effectively using a shallow depth of field to highlight the man and draw the viewer's attention to him. The man is looking to his right and speaking, with slight movements of his head and shoulders, suggesting he is engaged in a conversation or listening intently. The background features a mix of vintage and modern elements, including a wooden counter and a small table with a green bottle to the left. Directly behind the man in the top left-center, an opening shows another room with a window, while to the right, the background includes a counter with a sink and a small birdhouse on a surface. The setting suggests an indoor environment during the daytime, with natural lighting filtering through windows and casting soft shadows, contributing to a cozy, lived-in atmosphere. The overall color palette is warm, with earthy tones and soft greens, creating a welcoming ambiance.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
