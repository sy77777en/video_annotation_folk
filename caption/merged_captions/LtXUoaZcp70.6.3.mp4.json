  "merged_caption": "In a wide, top-down shot, a long, black rectangular table is positioned horizontally across the center of the frame in the middle ground. A single red figure stands near the center of the table, with numerous orange figures surrounding the table's top, bottom, and right sides, all in the middle ground. On the table, a white grid is located in the center, and a glowing red object in a box is to its left. In the top left quadrant, a few orange figures stand in the middle ground, while a single blue figure is stationary in a walking position in the doorway in the top left background. From a high-angle, top-down view over the table, the camera steadily and smoothly ascends, moving from an overhead to an aerial level to reveal more of the scene. Towards the end of the ascent, it performs a subtle clockwise roll. The entire scene is kept in sharp focus with a large depth of field. In a top-down animated view, a blue figure walks out of a doorway at the top of the screen. A red figure is positioned at the center of a long table, surrounded by numerous orange figures. All figures, including the blue, red, and orange ones, remain mostly stationary throughout the scene. A dark, minimalist room with a grainy, textured floor is revealed, with a single, bright red figure positioned at the top-center of the table, in front of a white grid pattern on the table's surface. To the left of the grid is a small, translucent box containing a glowing red object. In the upper left of the room, a blue figure walks through a doorway, while a few other orange figures stand nearby, separate from the group at the table.",

    "Subject": "In a dark, top-down view, a group of abstract, monochrome human figures are gathered. A single red figure stands at the head of a long, black rectangular table, leaning over a white grid-like object on its surface. Surrounding the table are numerous orange figures, all oriented towards the red figure. To the left of the table, a few other orange figures stand apart from the main group. In the upper left corner, a single blue figure walks through a doorway. Beneath the table on the left is a translucent box containing a glowing red object.",

    "Scene": "A top-down view reveals a dark, minimalist room with a grainy, textured floor. At the center, a long, black rectangular table is surrounded by numerous stylized, orange-colored figures. A single, bright red figure is positioned at the top-center of the table, in front of a white grid pattern on the table's surface. To the left of the grid is a small, translucent box containing a glowing red object. In the upper left of the room, a blue figure walks through a doorway, while a few other orange figures stand nearby, separate from the group at the table.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
