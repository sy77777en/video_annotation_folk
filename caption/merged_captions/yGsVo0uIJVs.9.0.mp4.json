  "merged_caption": "The video features a medium full shot of a low-poly, faceted human figure with a geometric design, resembling a man, shown from the shoulders down, positioned slightly to the left of the center in the foreground, moving towards the left side of the frame. The figure, depicted in shades of gray, giving it a monochromatic appearance, occupies the lower half of the frame vertically and holds a book or folder in its left hand and a briefcase in its right hand. Although the figure appears to be walking, it is actually stationary. The camera is positioned at eye level with a high angle, looking down, using deep focus with a large depth of field. It moves slowly forward, panning from right to left, and tilting down smoothly without shaking. As the camera moves, the figure is positioned in front of a wooden desk with metal legs, situated in the middle ground, slightly to the right. The desk is organized with a blue pen holder, a classic black desk lamp, and scattered papers. Behind the desk, a standard black, mobile office chair is visible, positioned in the middle ground, slightly to the right. In the background, a wooden chair is located in the corner of the office, and a painting adorns the wall at the center top. A row of folders is placed on top of the filing cabinet in the upper right corner of the frame. The scene is set indoors in a dimly lit office with a minimalist design and monochromatic color scheme. The environment is illuminated by light streaming through a window on the left, casting distinct shadows on the smooth floor. Overlay text \"[14]\" is present in the lower left corner of the frame.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
