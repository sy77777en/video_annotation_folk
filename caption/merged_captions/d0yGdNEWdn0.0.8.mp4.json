  "merged_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of a middle-aged man with light skin, short dark brown hair that is thinning on top, and a full, short, dark brown beard and mustache with some gray, positioned in the center foreground. He is wearing a light blue, long-sleeved, button-up collared shirt and a red lanyard with a name badge around his neck. A thin black wire, likely for a microphone, is visible near his collar. In the background, a dark red wall section is visible on the left, with a light-colored wooden cabinet positioned underneath it. A large white projection screen occupies the right background. The man, holding a clicker in his right hand, gestures actively with both hands, primarily in front of his chest. He gestures with his left hand, moving it up and then out to his left. He then brings both hands up in front of his chest, palms facing each other, and moves them slightly apart and together. He brings both hands up again, palms facing each other, and moves them apart and together. Throughout the video, he is speaking. The camera is at eye-level, maintaining a level angle. It uses a deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping the speaker in the foreground and the background relatively sharp. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady. The scene is set indoors, likely a presentation room or lecture hall, with artificial lighting illuminating the space evenly.",

    "Subject": "A middle-aged man with light skin, short dark brown hair that is thinning on top, and a full, short, dark brown beard and mustache with some gray, stands and speaks. He is wearing a light blue, long-sleeved, button-up collared shirt. Around his neck is a red lanyard with a name badge. A thin black wire, likely for a microphone, is visible near his collar. He gestures with both hands as he talks, holding a clicker in his right hand.",

    "Scene": "The scene is set indoors, likely a presentation room or lecture hall. A man stands in the foreground, but the background features a prominent dark red wall section to the left. Adjacent to this, a light-colored wooden cabinet or lectern with a dark rectangular opening is visible. To the right, a large, bright white projection screen occupies a significant portion of the view. The lighting appears to be artificial, illuminating the space evenly.",
    "Spatial": "The video presents a medium shot of a man positioned in the center foreground. In the background, a dark red wall section is visible on the left, with a light-colored wooden cabinet positioned underneath it. A large white projection screen occupies the right background. The man, holding a clicker in his right hand, gestures actively with both hands, primarily in front of his chest. The camera remains stationary at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
