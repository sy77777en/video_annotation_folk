  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a close-up shot of a man's back, prominently centered in the foreground. He has short, dark, wavy hair and is wearing a dark, structured jacket with a light-colored dust or powder scattered across his shoulders and upper back. The camera follows him from behind at his level in an unsteady, eye-level tracking shot, maintaining a shallow depth of field to keep him in focus. As he walks away from the camera down a dimly lit, green-hued corridor, he forcefully pulls at both sides of his collar, shaking the dust off his jacket. The corridor's walls appear to be made of concrete or brick, and multiple light sources illuminate the scene: a single lamp casts a green hue, while natural light streams in from both sides at the far end of the corridor. The man maintains a strong presence as he moves forward at a steady pace, gradually transitioning from a close-up to a medium shot. As he continues down the long corridor, his figure becomes a silhouette against the light at the far end, becoming smaller in the frame. Initially, some dust or debris is visible on the back of the jacket, which then falls away. The camera maintains its focus on the man as he moves away, capturing the dynamic interplay of light and shadow that defines the scene.",

    "Camera": "This is an unsteady, eye-level tracking shot that moves forward, following a man from behind. The camera maintains a shallow depth of field, keeping the man in the foreground in focus as he moves away and becomes smaller in the frame.",
    "Subject": "A man with short, dark, wavy hair is seen from behind, wearing a dark, structured jacket. A light-colored dust or powder is scattered across his shoulders and upper back. He walks away from the camera down a dimly lit, green-hued corridor, his figure becoming a silhouette against the light at the far end.",
    "Motion": "A man, seen from behind, forcefully pulls at both sides of his collar, shaking the dust off his jacket. He walks forward at a steady pace, moving away from the camera down a long, dimly lit, green-hued corridor, his figure becoming a silhouette as he approaches the light at the far end.",
    "Scene": "From a perspective following from behind, a person in a dark jacket walks down a dimly lit, hazy indoor corridor. The walls appear to be made of concrete or brick. Multiple light sources illuminate the scene: a single lamp casts a green hue, while natural light streams in from both sides at the far end of the corridor, creating a silhouette of the person as they move forward. Initially, some dust or debris is visible on the back of the jacket, which then falls away.",
    "Spatial": "The video opens with a close-up shot of a man's back, prominently centered in the foreground. He walks away from the camera down a corridor, maintaining a strong presence as he moves. The camera follows him from behind at his level, transitioning to a medium shot. The man remains a dominant figure in the frame, gradually becoming a silhouette against the light at the far end of the corridor."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
