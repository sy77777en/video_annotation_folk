  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot captured from a low-angle perspective, featuring a moving, low-angle shot of the Chicago Cultural Center. The grand, classical-style building, constructed from light-colored stone, extends from the middle ground to the right foreground and features a series of large, arched windows. A blue-green banner with white text and a geometric design is fixed next to one of the upper-story windows. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp as it slowly moves forward and to the left, viewed from the street level. In the background, a taller, light-colored skyscraper rises into the sky to the left of the center, against a sky featuring hues of yellow and green. The middle ground contains the top of a street lamp and the bare branches of a tree, both located in the bottom-left corner. The scene is bathed in a blue sky, which appears somber due to a filter applied, creating an imposing atmosphere. The structure is identified by a banner as the Chicago Cultural Center, and the focus is on establishing a sense of place and conveying the monumental scale of the urban architecture rather than highlighting a specific person or object.",

    "Camera": "From a low, eye-level perspective, this very smooth shot looks up at a large stone building. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp as it slowly moves forward and to the left.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a low-angle cityscape scenery shot, capturing the grand facade of a classical-style stone building. The structure, identified by a banner as the Chicago Cultural Center, features a series of large, arched windows and ornate stonework, with a taller, more modern skyscraper visible in the distance behind it. The scene is bathed in a blue sky, which appears somber due to a filter applied, creating an imposing atmosphere. There is no main subject, as the focus is on establishing a sense of place and conveying the monumental scale of the urban architecture rather than highlighting a specific person or object.",
    "Motion": "This scenery video features a moving, low-angle shot of the Chicago Cultural Center. The grand, classical-style building, with its stone facade and large arched windows, is viewed from the street level. A taller skyscraper can be seen in the background against the sky.",
    "Scene": "A low-angle, outdoor view captures the facade of the Chicago Cultural Center under a pale greenish-yellow sky. The large, classical building is constructed from light-colored stone and features a series of prominent arched windows. A blue-green banner with white text and a geometric design is fixed next to one of the upper-story windows. In the background, a taller, light-colored skyscraper rises into the sky. The bare branches of a tree and a street lamp are visible in the lower-left corner of the scene.",
    "Spatial": "This video presents a wide scenery shot captured from a low-angle perspective.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
