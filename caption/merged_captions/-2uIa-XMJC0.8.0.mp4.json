  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of a dimly lit room filled with screens, creating a futuristic ambiance. Initially, there is no primary subject, and the focus remains on the abstract, neon-colored elements in the background. The scene is characterized by a variety of glowing, neon-colored elements that create a surreal atmosphere, with lighting primarily in blue and purple, casting an otherworldly glow. The camera, positioned at eye level with a level angle, simulates an FPV view and features mild barrel distortion, causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward. It maintains a deep focus and large depth of field, continuously panning and tilting to explore the surroundings. The video begins with a blurred, dark room filled with multiple screens displaying various images and data, including brain scans and other data visualizations. As the camera moves, a man appears in the background, walking towards the camera from the left side, moving slightly right of center in the middle ground. He is a white man wearing black pants, a gray hoodie, a necklace, and has short hair. As he approaches, the shot transitions from a full shot of the man to a medium shot, and his face becomes clearer, showing a focused expression. The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking, intensifying toward the end as the man interacts with the camera by punching it, with the screens still visible in the background. The neon elements persist, reinforcing the high-tech atmosphere. After the interaction, the shot returns to a full shot of the man, maintaining the room's immersive and surreal environment. The video concludes with the camera shaking intensely, enhancing the dynamic interplay of light and shadow.",

    "Camera": "The video features mild barrel distortion, causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, maintaining a deep focus and large depth of field. It simulates an FPV view within a room, continuously panning and tilting to explore the surroundings. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking, intensifying toward the end as the camera shakes intensely when a person punches toward the viewer.",
    "Subject": "The video shows a white man in a room filled with screens. He is wearing black pants, a gray hoodie, a necklace, and has short hair. The focus is on his interaction with the camera.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a blurred, dark room filled with multiple screens displaying various images and data. As the camera moves, the screens continue to show different, colorful displays, including brain scans and other data visualizations. A man appears in the background, walking towards the camera. He gets closer, and his face becomes clearer, showing a focused expression. The video concludes with the man punching the camera, with the screens still visible in the background.",
    "Scene": "The video presents a first-person POV shot set in a dimly lit indoor environment, characterized by a futuristic and abstract aesthetic. The scene is dominated by a variety of glowing, neon-colored elements that create a surreal atmosphere. The lighting is primarily blue and purple, casting an otherworldly glow over the surroundings. The setting appears to be filled with digital or holographic displays, contributing to a high-tech ambiance. The overall mood is enhanced by the dynamic interplay of light and shadow, with the neon elements providing the primary source of illumination. The scene transitions smoothly, maintaining a consistent color scheme and visual style throughout.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a wide shot of a dimly lit room filled with screens, creating a futuristic ambiance.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
