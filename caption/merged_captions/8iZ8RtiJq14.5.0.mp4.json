  "merged_caption": "This medium close-up shot is framed from an over-the-shoulder perspective, with the back of a figure's head occupying the right foreground. The main subject, a silver, featureless humanoid figure, is positioned in the center-left middle ground, standing in front of a wooden counter. The figure wears a light blue, collared button-down shirt and a light gray tie, with its smooth, reflective, silver head devoid of any facial features. Its hands, which are also silver and metallic, are held up with the palms facing upward in a presentational gesture. To the left of this central figure is a display of chocolate, while to the right are shelves holding candy and other items, all located in the middle ground. The scene is set inside a small, artificially lit shop, with a brick wall and additional shelving visible in the background. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level and slightly moves forward, using a deep focus to keep the entire store scene sharp. The silver humanoid figure remains completely still, holding its hands up in a fixed gesture. The second figure, positioned on the right side of the frame and viewed from behind, is only partially visible, showing just the back of the head and neck, and is also motionless. The shot is captured from an eye-level, level angle, with the slightly unsteady camera moving slowly forward toward the silver, faceless figure. The background features various product displays, including a turquoise shelf holding boxes of chocolate labeled \"Cacao\" and another display on the right containing colorful boxes of candy. An overlay at the bottom-left of the screen displays a white text caption \"[4].\"",

    "Subject": "A humanoid figure with a smooth, reflective, silver head devoid of any facial features is shown from the chest up. The figure wears a light blue, collared button-down shirt and a light gray tie. Its hands, which are also silver and metallic, are held up with the palms facing upward in a presentational gesture.

    "Scene": "From an over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned in front of one character and behind another, showing the first one's upper body, the second one's back of the head and neck, and the scene ahead, the scene is set inside a small, artificially lit shop. A figure with a featureless, metallic silver head and hands stands behind a wooden counter, wearing a light blue shirt and a white tie. The background features a brick wall and various product displays. On the counter, there are two smaller displays: a turquoise shelf holding boxes of chocolate labeled \"Cacao\" and another display on the right containing colorful boxes of candy. Behind the counter, there are larger displays. An overlay at the bottom-left of the screen displays a white text caption \"[4].\"",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
