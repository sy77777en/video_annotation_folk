  "merged_caption": "The video features a wide shot of an elephant moving through a forested area. Initially, the elephant is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. As it walks, it shifts slightly to the left, maintaining its position in the middle ground. The forest, with its tall, slender trees, forms a natural frame around the elephant. These trees are positioned in the foreground and background, creating depth and emphasizing the elephant's path through the scene. The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, using deep focus to keep all elements sharp. It smoothly pans left to track the elephant moving through the forest, ensuring minimal shaking during the movement. The elephant is large, with a gray, wrinkled hide and prominent tusks curving outward. Its ears are large and flap slightly as it moves steadily, navigating through the trees with ease. The setting suggests a natural habitat, emphasizing the elephant's presence in the wild. The forest is dense with tall, slender trees that have light-colored bark, and the ground is covered with sparse grass and patches of earth. The setting is during the day, with natural light filtering through the tree canopy, creating a serene atmosphere. The elephant's large, gray body and tusks contrast with the lighter tree trunks. The environment is calm, with no visible weather disturbances, and the scene remains consistent throughout, focusing on the natural interaction between the elephant and its surroundings. The spatial composition remains consistent, with the elephant navigating between the trees, which are evenly distributed across the frame.",

The elephant moves steadily, with its ears flapping slightly as it progresses. The background remains consistent with the forest environment, featuring numerous trees and a natural, undisturbed landscape.",
    "Scene": "The video captures an outdoor scene in a forested area with numerous tall, slender trees featuring pale, smooth bark. The setting is during the day, with natural light filtering through the tree canopy, creating a serene atmosphere. The ground is covered with sparse grass and patches of earth. An elephant is present, moving through the trees, its large, gray body and tusks contrasting with the lighter tree trunks.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
