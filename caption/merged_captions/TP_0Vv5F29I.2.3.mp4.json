  "merged_caption": "In a level shot, a man wearing a blue helmet, a black long-sleeved shirt, and bright orange pants is positioned on a black mountain bike atop a moving freight train that travels from right to left across the lower half of the frame. Initially, the man is on a blue ramp featuring a Red Bull logo in the lower center, with a mature cornfield in the middle ground to the left and a parked green combine harvester in the middle ground to the right. A railroad crossing sign, complete with a red octagonal \"STOP\" sign, occupies the foreground at the center-left. The camera executes a smooth counterclockwise arc around the biker, maintaining an eye-level perspective and getting slightly closer to the subject. As the man rides up the ramp, he launches into the air and executes a front flip, landing on a large blue shipping container marked with a wide red stripe bearing the word \"PRADA\" in white capital letters, which becomes the central element. He then rides from left to right across the top of this container. As he reaches a set of light wood stairs at the container's right end, he performs a backflip, moving from the top-center left to the center-left to land on another flatbed car. The camera continues to arc around and lowers to the subject's level, keeping the man centered as he rides on the final car. The scene unfolds in a rural landscape at dusk, with the silhouette of a small town and a church steeple visible against the pale sky in the distance. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the biker, the train, and the rural background sharp and clear.",

    "Camera": "This is a smooth tracking shot that follows a biker performing stunts on a moving train. The camera executes a counterclockwise arc around the biker, maintaining an eye-level perspective throughout. As it moves, the camera also gets slightly closer to the subject. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the biker, the train, and the rural background sharp and clear.",
    "Subject": "A man wearing a blue helmet, a black long-sleeved shirt, and bright orange pants performs stunts on a black mountain bike atop a moving freight train. He ascends a blue ramp featuring a Red Bull logo, executes a front flip in mid-air, and lands on a large blue shipping container marked with a wide red stripe bearing the word \"PRADA\" in white capital letters. The man then performs a backflip over a staircase at the end of the container, which appears to be light wood in color, before landing on another flatbed car.",
    "Motion": "A man on a mountain bike rides up a ramp on a moving flatbed train car, launches into the air, and executes a frontflip. He lands on top of a blue shipping container on the next car and rides along its length. Upon reaching the end of the container, he rides off a set of stairs and performs a backflip, landing on another flatbed car and continuing to ride forward as the train moves along the tracks.",
    "Scene": "In a rural landscape at dusk, a long freight train travels along tracks that bisect a vast expanse of farmland. On the left side of the tracks, a mature cornfield stands tall, while on the right lies a tilled, empty field where a green combine harvester is parked. In the distance, the silhouette of a small town with a church steeple is visible against the pale sky. The train itself is composed of flatbed cars, some of which have been modified with unique structures: a blue and red ramp bearing a \"Red Bull\" logo, a large blue shipping container with a horizontal red stripe and the word \"PRADA\" in white, and a light wood staircase. A railroad crossing sign, complete with a red octagonal \"STOP\" sign, stands in the foreground next to the moving train.",
    "Spatial": "In a level shot, a man on a bicycle is positioned on a train that moves from right to left across the lower half of the frame. Initially, the man is on a ramp in the lower center, with a cornfield in the middle ground to the left and a combine harvester in the middle ground to the right. A railroad crossing sign occupies the foreground at the center-left. The camera arcs around the man as he rides up the ramp and performs a flip, landing on a large container that becomes the central element. He then rides from left to right across the top of this container. As he reaches a set of stairs at the container's right end, he performs another flip, moving from the top-center left to the center-left to land on a subsequent flatbed car. The camera continues to arc around and lowers to the subject's level, keeping the man centered as he rides on the final car."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
