  "merged_caption": "This full shot captures a mixed gray-brown squirrel with a white underside and a large, bushy tail in the top-left foreground, positioned on top of a rough, bark-covered wooden post. The camera is static, positioned at the squirrel's level with a level angle, and uses a shallow depth of field to keep the focus on the squirrel. Initially, the squirrel sits upright with its front paws held together near its chest. In a daytime outdoor setting, the background, which is out of focus, features a weathered wooden fence with vertical slats and a dense thicket of bare tree branches. The squirrel leans forward, looks down, and turns back, beginning to climb headfirst down the side of the post. As it descends, it grips the bark with its claws while its tail curls over the top, surrounding the opposite side of the trunk. The squirrel then bites into a protruding portion of the trunk's bark. Its body moves lower in the frame while its tail remains curled over the top. The camera and framing remain static throughout the video.",

    "Camera": "This is a static, eye-level shot with a level angle. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the focus on the squirrel perched on the tree stump in the foreground.",

    "Scene": "In a daytime outdoor setting, a grey squirrel is positioned atop a rough, bark-covered tree stump. The background, which is out of focus, features a weathered wooden fence with vertical slats and a dense thicket of bare tree branches. The squirrel, initially sitting upright with its paws held together, proceeds to move headfirst down the side of the stump, clinging to the bark and gnawing on the wood.",
    "Spatial": "This full shot captures a grey squirrel in the top-left foreground, positioned on top of a wooden post. A wooden fence extends across the middle ground, with out-of-focus trees filling the background. The camera is positioned at the squirrel's level. Initially, the squirrel sits upright on the post. It then leans forward and begins to climb headfirst down the side of the post, its body moving lower in the frame while its tail remains curled over the top. The camera and framing remain static throughout the video."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
