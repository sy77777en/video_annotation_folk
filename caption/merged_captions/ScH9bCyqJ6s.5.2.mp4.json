  "merged_caption": "An extreme close-up shot, filmed from directly above, centers on a pair of light-skinned hands in the foreground holding a small, intricate electronic component. The component, consisting of two metal plates connected by a black plastic frame, is held in the middle of the frame against a blurred background of other disassembled parts. The first metal plate features a grid of circular perforations and an etched, square-shaped QR code. Through cutouts in the second metal plate, a small blue square component and a silver-colored square component with a white center are visible. The right thumb, initially positioned on the right side of the component, moves slightly to the left, partially covering about half of the perforated section, and then slides slightly to the right, revealing the grid of circular perforations on the metal plate. The component is raised closer to the camera and then lowered, with the hands holding it steady between their thumbs and index fingers. The static, bird's-eye view shot employs an extremely shallow depth of field, with the focus fixed on the small electronic component held in the foreground.",

    "Camera": "This is a static, bird's-eye view shot with an extremely shallow depth of field. The focus is fixed on the small electronic component held in the foreground.",
    "Subject": "A pair of light-skinned hands holds a small, intricate electronic component. The component consists of two metal plates connected by a black plastic frame. One metal plate has a small, etched QR code and a grid of circular perforations on one side. Through cutouts in the second metal plate, a small blue square component and a silver-colored square component with a white center are visible. The hands are holding the object between their thumbs and index fingers, with the right thumb partially covering the perforated section of the first metal plate.",
    "Motion": "A pair of hands holds a small electronic component steady. Initially, the right thumb is not covering the perforations. It then moves to the left, partially covering about half of the component, which is raised closer to the camera and then lowered. Simultaneously, the right thumb slides slightly to the right, revealing the grid of circular perforations on the metal plate.",
    "Scene": "An overhead POV shot shows a pair of hands holding a small, rectangular electronic component against a blurred background of other disassembled parts. The component consists of two metal plates secured by a black frame. The first plate has a grid of circular perforations on one side and an etched, square-shaped code on the other. A small, bright blue square is visible on the second metal plate. The hands hold the object steady, with a thumb resting near the perforated section.",
    "Spatial": "An extreme close-up shot, filmed from directly above, centers on a pair of hands in the foreground holding a small electronic component. The component is held in the middle of the frame, with a blurred background of other disassembled parts. The right thumb, positioned on the right side of the component, moves slightly to reveal a grid of perforations on a metal plate."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
