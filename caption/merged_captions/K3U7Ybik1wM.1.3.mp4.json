  "merged_caption": "From a bird's eye top-down angle, first-person perspective, the shot initially looks down at a bare foot with red-painted toenails in the bottom-center middle ground, along with the hem of blue pants. The camera, from a shaky, first-person, bird's-eye view at eye level, looks down at the ground while arcing clockwise as the person turns. It then moves forward, revealing a carpeted staircase descending from the foreground into the background, occupying the center of the frame. Wooden banisters on the left and right sides frame the staircase, also receding into the background. The stairs are covered in a neutral-toned carpet, flanked by wooden banisters with vertical spindles, and the surrounding walls are a light color. A small, white-and-black object, possibly a stuffed animal or a small pet, is positioned in the background at the top-center of the frame at the bottom of the stairs. The person begins to descend the stairs, and the entire scene is rendered with a wavy, distorting visual effect that ripples across the frame, particularly noticeable on the wooden railing to the left, while the camera remains at a bird's eye top-down angle, positioned at the top of the stairs looking down. The entire video is distorted by a post-edited, trippy ripple effect, making the camera's focus unclear.",

The entire video is distorted by a post-edited, trippy ripple effect, making the camera's focus unclear.",
    "Subject": "From a first-person perspective, the video shows a person with fair skin looking down while walking. Their bare foot, with red-painted toenails, is visible at the bottom of the frame, along with the hem of their blue pants. Then, the subject walks toward a carpeted staircase with wooden banisters on either side. At the bottom of the stairs, a small, white-and-black object, possibly a stuffed animal or a small pet, is sitting. A wavy, distorting visual effect is applied to the scene.",
    "Motion": "From a first-person perspective, a person walks forward toward a carpeted staircase, their bare foot briefly visible at the bottom of the frame. They begin to descend the stairs.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a view from the top of a dimly lit, carpeted staircase inside a house. The camera initially looks down at bare feet with red-painted toenails. The stairs are covered in a neutral-toned carpet, flanked by wooden banisters with vertical spindles. The surrounding walls are a light color. A prominent visual distortion creates a wavy, rippling effect across the scene, particularly noticeable on the wooden railing to the left.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
