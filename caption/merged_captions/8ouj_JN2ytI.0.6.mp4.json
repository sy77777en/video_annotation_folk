  "merged_caption": "In a medium close-up shot filmed at the subjects' level, a line of football players and a coach are positioned in the foreground. Initially, a player in a number 7 jersey is on the far left, a coach is left of center, and a player in a number 91 jersey is in the center of the frame. A large crowd of spectators fills the background. The camera, from a level angle and eye-level perspective, smoothly moves rightward, capturing the team of football players. The shot uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the players in the foreground in sharp focus. As the camera moves to the right, the player with number 7 gradually moves out of the frame on the left. Consequently, the coach shifts to the far left, the player with number 91 moves to the left of center, and another player wearing number 99 becomes fully visible, occupying the right side of the frame. The men remain mostly stationary, with a slight swaying of their bodies, while the two individuals in the center stand with their hands placed over their hearts. The player in the number 91 jersey is a white man with short dark hair, a light goatee, and black eye paint under his eyes, wearing a yellow, black, and grey jersey with \"GOTHAM\" printed in black on the front. To the left of him, the coach, a man with a light brown skin tone and a bald head, stands wearing a black jacket over a yellow shirt with a \"GOTHAM\" team logo on the chest. To the right of the first player is another white man with a full brown beard, short brown hair, and black eye paint, wearing a matching \"GOTHAM\" jersey with the number \"99\". All the men have serious expressions.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
