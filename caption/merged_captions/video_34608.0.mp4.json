  "merged_caption": "This video is an extreme wide scenery shot with no main subject, focusing on a mountainous landscape. Initially, a large, green, conical mountain peak is positioned in the center-left of the frame, occupying the middle ground. Thick white clouds are in the foreground, middle ground, and background, swirling around the base and sides of this peak, particularly on the right side of the frame. In the background, the tips of two other distant peaks are visible in the top-center, emerging from the sea of clouds under an overcast sky that fills the top of the frame. The camera, from a smooth, high-angle aerial perspective, moves steadily forward, maintaining a deep focus to keep the entire landscape sharp. As it advances, the main peak shifts towards the left of the frame, and the camera flies alongside its slope, eventually moving into the dense clouds which increasingly fill the frame from the right and bottom, obscuring the view. The summit ridge of the prominent peak is visible above the thick layer of white clouds, and the camera continues to glide alongside the mountain, capturing the serene and ethereal \"sea of clouds\" effect. In the distance, other bluish-gray peaks emerge from the fog, adding to the grand scale and atmospheric mood of the environment. The focus is on capturing the vastness of nature rather than a specific object or entity, emphasizing the majestic, conical mountain peak covered in a dense, lush green forest. The overcast sky provides a bright backdrop, enhancing the contrast between the vibrant greenery and the swirling white clouds.",

    "Camera": "From a smooth, high-angle aerial perspective, the camera moves forward toward a green mountain peak that is partially obscured by thick, white clouds. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire landscape sharp.",
    "Subject": "This video is an aerial landscape scenery shot that glides alongside a majestic, conical mountain peak covered in a dense, lush green forest. Thick, white clouds and fog swirl around the mountain's base and sides, creating a serene and ethereal \"sea of clouds\" effect, with the tips of other distant peaks visible in the background under a bright, overcast sky. There is no main subject because the focus is on capturing the grand scale and atmospheric mood of the environment, emphasizing the vastness of nature rather than a specific object or entity.",
    "Motion": "This is an aerial scenery shot of a lush, green mountain peak surrounded by a sea of thick, white clouds. The camera slowly moves forward, flying along the misty ridgeline. In the distance, other mountain peaks are visible poking through the cloud layer under an overcast sky.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone provides an aerial perspective of a mountain range on an overcast day. A prominent, conical peak covered in dense green forest occupies the center of the view, its summit ridge visible above a thick layer of white clouds. The clouds swirl around the mountain's base and sides, obscuring the landscape below. In the distance, other bluish-gray peaks emerge from the sea of fog. The camera moves slowly forward, flying alongside the main peak and into the enveloping clouds.",
    "Spatial": "This video is an extreme wide scenery shot with no main subject, focusing on a mountainous landscape. Initially, a large, green, conical mountain peak is positioned in the center-left of the frame, occupying the middle ground. Thick white clouds are in the foreground, middle ground, and background, swirling around the base and sides of this peak, particularly on the right side of the frame. In the background, the tips of two other distant peaks are visible in the top-center, emerging from the sea of clouds under an overcast sky that fills the top of the frame. The camera, positioned at a high aerial height level with the upper part of the main peak, moves steadily forward. As it advances, the main peak shifts towards the left of the frame, and the camera flies alongside its slope, eventually moving into the dense clouds which increasingly fill the frame from the right and bottom, obscuring the view."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
