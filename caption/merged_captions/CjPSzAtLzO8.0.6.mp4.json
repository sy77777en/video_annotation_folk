  "merged_caption": "The video commences with a wide shot, where two motocross riders expertly navigate a left curve on an asphalt track set in a yellow sand field, showcasing their impressive skills as they drift their motorcycles at high speeds. The track extends from the bottom right foreground, curving towards the top left and into the middle ground. A white, elevated, open-sided structure is situated in the top left, within the middle ground, on the sandy expanse. Hazy mountains are visible across the top background under a clear, pale blue sky, suggesting a daytime setting. As the motorcyclists, riding closely together, proceed along the curve, leaning into the turn and speeding around the bend, they move towards the center-left of the frame and further into the middle ground. The camera, positioned at an overhead level approximately second-floor height, employs a Dutch angle that varies due to a slight clockwise roll as it moves backward, revealing more of the race. The focus is deep, keeping a large depth of field sharp. The camera pulls back, transitioning to an extreme wide shot. In this wider view, the motorcyclists appear smaller, located in the center-left middle ground, while the track and the surrounding desert landscape occupy a larger portion of the foreground and middle ground, with the mountains remaining in the distant background. The camera maintains a position above the subjects, emphasizing the dynamic movements and forward momentum of the riders as they maneuver through the challenging terrain. The overall scene captures the thrilling dynamics of the race, with the smooth camera movement enhancing the visual experience.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at an overhead level, approximately second-floor height, providing a high-angle view of a motorcycle on a racetrack. The camera employs a Dutch angle that varies due to a slight clockwise roll as it moves backward, revealing more of the race. The focus is deep, keeping a large depth of field sharp. The camera movement is very smooth.",
    "Subject": "Two motocross riders expertly navigate a track set in a yellow sand field, showcasing their impressive skills as they drift their motorcycles at high speeds along the curves. The video emphasizes the dynamic movements and forward momentum of the riders as they maneuver through the challenging terrain.",
    "Motion": "Two motocross riders race closely together on their motorcycles, riding side by side as they approach a left-hand curve on a paved track in a sandy environment, leaning into the turn and speeding around the bend.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone shows two motorcyclists navigating a sharp left turn on an asphalt racetrack, riding closely together. The track, marked with a black and yellow checkered curb, curves through a vast, sandy desert landscape under a clear, pale blue sky. In the background, hazy mountains are visible on the horizon. A small, white, elevated, open-sided structure stands on the sandy area to the left of the track. The overall scene suggests a daytime setting.",
    "Spatial": "The video commences with a wide shot, where two motorcyclists are positioned in the middle ground as they navigate a left curve on an asphalt track.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
