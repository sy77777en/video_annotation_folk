  "merged_caption": "The video begins with an inverted medium-full shot, positioning two grappling individuals in the center of the frame. One person, with a light skin tone, is wearing a white short-sleeved t-shirt that has ridden up to expose their midriff, and dark-colored pants, while the other is wearing light gray or white pants. Both are holding onto a piece of red fabric wrapped between them. A dark vertical pole effect is situated in the center of the scene, with the checkered floor visible at the top of the frame in the background, and framed pictures hanging on the background walls. Animated, glowing orange light streaks swirl in both the foreground and middle ground, encircling the central action. The scene is presented with a grainy, vintage quality and framed by black overlay bars on the left and right. The camera starts from an unsteady, shaky, upside-down, eye-level, level-angle perspective, capturing the static individuals. It then cranes up in an arc, transitioning to a ground-level, upside-down low angle, before shifting to a normal worm’s-eye view, looking up at the subjects who remain centrally framed. The camera maintains deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The checkered floor and blue-green ceiling, along with the light-colored walls, provide a distinct indoor environment. The camera movement creates the illusion of a change in the subjects' position, enhancing the dynamic visual experience. The animated light streaks continue to swirl and move dynamically around the central pole, adding to the visual complexity of the scene.",

    "Subject": "The video features two people grappling with each other, entangled with a piece of red fabric. Both individuals are seen from the thighs up, with one person, who has a light skin tone, wearing a white short-sleeved t-shirt that has ridden up to expose their midriff, and dark-colored pants. The other person is wearing light gray or white pants. Both are standing upright, but the camera angle shifts from an upside-down perspective, creating the illusion of a change in their position during the video. They are both holding onto the red fabric, which is wrapped between them during their struggle.",
    "Motion": "From an upside-down perspective, two people are seen holding a piece of red fabric between them. Both individuals remain static, while the camera transitions from an upside-down view to a worm's-eye view, capturing the scene from different angles.",
    "Scene": "This indoor scene, presented with a grainy, vintage quality and framed by black overlay bars on the left and right, is set in a room with a black-and-white checkered floor and a blue-green ceiling. A dark vertical pole, appearing as a video effect, stands in the center of the space, with a long piece of red fabric wrapped around two figures. In the background, light-colored walls are decorated with framed pictures. The scene features animated, glowing orange light streaks, which are video effects that swirl and move dynamically around the central pole.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with an inverted medium-full shot, positioning two grappling individuals in the center of the frame. A dark vertical pole effect is situated in the center of the scene, with a piece of red fabric wrapped around the central subjects. Due to the inverted framing, the checkered floor is visible at the top of the frame in the background, while framed pictures hang on the background walls. Animated, glowing orange light streaks swirl in both the foreground and middle ground, encircling the central action. The camera then performs a 90-degree upward crane movement, transitioning the shot into a worm's-eye view, looking up at the subjects who remain centrally framed."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
