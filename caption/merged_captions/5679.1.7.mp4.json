  "merged_caption": "This wide shot, captured from the subjects' level, frames a very large, off-white poodle with shaggy, curly fur and a blue collar in the center of the frame and a person near the center-right. The poodle sits on its haunches on a manicured green lawn, looking down at the person, who is wearing a blue hooded sweatshirt with the hood up, light-wash blue jeans, and dark shoes. The person stands with their arms raised and bent, hands near their head, in a pose that suggests dancing to a beat. In the background, a single-story house with a dark, shingled roof is visible on the right, surrounded by dense woods with some trees showing autumn colors like red and orange. A low, stacked stone retaining wall extends from the bottom left corner into the middle ground. The camera is static and positioned at eye level, using a deep focus to keep the entire scene, from the house and trees in the background to the giant poodle in the middle ground, sharp and clear. The lighting is diffused, suggesting an overcast day.",

    "Camera": "This is a static, eye-level shot with a level angle. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the entire scene, from the house and trees in the background to the giant poodle in the middle ground, sharp and clear.",
    "Subject": "An extraordinarily large, off-white poodle with shaggy, curly fur sits on its haunches on a grassy lawn. The dog wears a blue collar and has its head turned toward the right side of the frame. Beside the dog is a person wearing a blue hooded sweatshirt with the hood up, light-wash blue jeans, and dark shoes. The person is standing with their arms raised and bent, hands near their head, in a pose that suggests dancing.",
    "Motion": "The large poodle is seated on the lawn, looking down at the person, who is moving his arms in a manner that suggests he is dancing to a beat.",
    "Scene": "An outdoor scene is set on a manicured green lawn in a residential area, surrounded by dense woods. In the background, a single-story house with a dark, shingled roof is visible among the trees, some of which show autumn colors like red and orange. A low, stacked stone retaining wall lines the edge of the grassy yard. The most prominent feature is an exceptionally large, cream-colored poodle with textured, curly fur and a blue collar, sitting calmly on the lawn. A person wearing a blue hooded sweatshirt and jeans stands nearby, dwarfed by the animal's size. The lighting is diffused, suggesting an overcast day.",
    "Spatial": "This wide shot, captured from the subjects' level, frames a very large poodle in the center of the frame and a person near the center-right. In the background, a house is visible on the right, with dense trees filling the top portion of the frame. A low stone wall extends from the bottom left corner into the middle ground."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
