  "merged_caption": "In a wide shot, two masked men in dark suits run through a long hall of an institutional building during the day. Each man wears a white clown mask with painted details, such as red smiles or blue accents around the eyes. The hall is defined by high ceilings, large light-colored stone pillars on both sides, and dark wooden teller counters on the right. Sunlight streams through tall windows on the left, casting bright patches and long shadows across a polished, light-colored tiled floor. A row of rectangular, lantern-style light fixtures hangs from the ceiling. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level, capturing an eye-level, slightly unsteady shot that moves backward to follow the two men. The man on the right foreground, holding a black handgun, runs ahead and takes cover behind a cash register, while the second man, also holding a gun, runs from the left middle ground toward the right, ahead of the counter. As the shot progresses, both men reach the middle ground, with one positioned in the center of the frame and the other on the right side of the frame. In the background, another masked figure is hitting people at another counter further down the hall. The camera trucks slightly to the right in the latter part of the clip, using a shallow depth of field, but the rapid movement of both the camera and the subjects causes them to frequently shift in and out of focus. The scene suggests a robbery, with several figures wearing suits and masks sprinting through the space.",

    "Subject": "A group of men, all dressed in dark suits, are running. Each man wears a white clown mask with painted details, such as red smiles or blue accents around the eyes. One man is holding a black handgun, while another is carrying a large bag.",
    "Motion": "Two men in suits and clown masks run through a long hall. The man on the right, holding a handgun, runs ahead and takes cover behind a cash register. The man on the left, also holding a gun, follows, running ahead of the counter. In the background, another masked figure is hitting people at another counter further down the hall.",
    "Scene": "The scene unfolds during the day inside a long, grand hallway of an institutional building, characterized by high ceilings and large, light-colored stone pillars. Sunlight streams through tall windows on the left, casting bright patches and long shadows across a polished, light-colored tiled floor. A row of rectangular, lantern-style light fixtures hangs from the ceiling, supplementing the natural light. Along the right side of the hall are dark wooden teller counters and desks. Several figures wearing suits and masks are sprinting through the space, suggesting they might be involved in a robbery.",
    "Spatial": "In a wide shot, two masked men run through a long hall. One man starts in the right foreground, moving toward the right, while a second man runs from the left middle ground toward the right. Other masked figures are visible in the background. As the shot progresses, both men reach the middle ground, with one positioned in the center of the frame and the other on the right side of the frame. The hall is defined by pillars on both sides and counters on the right, with sunlight from the left casting long shadows across the floor. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
