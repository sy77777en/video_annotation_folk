  "merged_caption": "This video is an extreme wide shot of a cityscape construction site at sunset, captured from a high-angle, first-person perspective by a drone with a noticeable fisheye lens. The scene opens with red construction elements in the foreground and a large red crane lattice in the middle ground. The active construction site occupies the bottom and center of the frame, with a modern high-rise building positioned in the right middle ground. Other buildings and cranes are visible in the background against a vibrant sky filled with turquoise, pink, and orange clouds. The camera maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping the entire cityscape sharp. It first glides forward, then ascends and turns left, initiating a counterclockwise roll. This motion shifts the perspective from a slightly rotated level angle to a 90-degree rotated view, causing the cityscape and cranes to rotate around the frame. The camera executes a rapid, disorienting rotational movement, tilting upwards and spinning, which shifts the perspective from looking down at the ground to looking up at the sky. The right element moves out of the frame and appears inverted and sideways by the end of the shot. The view is dominated by massive red construction cranes and towering, modern high-rise buildings, emphasizing the vast scale of the urban environment and the energetic atmosphere of development. The drone performs rapid rotations and a roll during the latter part of the video, offering sweeping, disorienting views of the cityscape, looking down on the active construction zone with its concrete foundations and up towards the towering structures. The camera's acrobatic movement emphasizes the feeling of height and the expansive nature of the city rather than any specific object.",

    "Camera": "This aerial drone footage, captured with a noticeable fisheye lens, presents a dusk view of a city under construction. The camera maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping the entire cityscape sharp. It first glides forward, then ascends and turns left as it initiates a counterclockwise roll, thereby shifting the perspective from a slightly rotated level angle to a 90-degree rotated view.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a dynamic cityscape scenery shot, captured from a high-angle, first-person perspective that flies above a large urban construction site. The view is dominated by massive red construction cranes and towering, modern high-rise buildings, all set against a dramatic sunset sky filled with vibrant turquoise, pink, and orange clouds. There is no single main subject, as the focus is intentionally placed on the vast scale of the urban environment and the energetic atmosphere of development. The camera's acrobatic movement emphasizes the feeling of height and the expansive nature of the city rather than any specific object.",
    "Motion": "This video offers a dynamic, wide-angle aerial view of a city construction site at sunset. The scene is characterized by towering cranes and high-rise buildings set against a vibrant sky of pink and turquoise. The camera moves rapidly, providing sweeping and disorienting views of the urban landscape.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures a dynamic flight through a dense urban construction site at sunset. The sky is a vibrant mix of turquoise, pink, and orange hues, backdropping numerous modern high-rise buildings and several large construction cranes. One prominent crane, painted red with a lattice structure, is visible alongside other cranes and buildings in various stages of completion. The drone performs rapid rotations and a roll during the latter part of the video, offering sweeping, disorienting views of the cityscape, looking down on the active construction zone with its concrete foundations and up towards the towering structures.",
    "Spatial": "This video is an extreme wide shot of a cityscape construction site. The scene opens from a high-angle perspective, with red construction elements in the foreground and a large red crane lattice in the middle ground. The active construction site occupies the bottom and center of the frame. A modern high-rise building is positioned in the right middle ground, with other buildings and cranes visible in the background against a colorful sunset sky at the top. The camera then executes a rapid, disorienting rotational movement, tilting upwards and spinning. This motion shifts the perspective from looking down at the ground to looking up at the sky, causing the cityscape and cranes to rotate around the frame, with the right element moving out of the frame and appearing inverted and sideways by the end of the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
