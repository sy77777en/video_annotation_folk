  "merged_caption": "This close-up shot frames a middle-aged or older man with light skin and visible wrinkles, particularly around his eyes, primarily in the left and center foreground. He has a short, graying beard and wears a dark fedora-style hat, the brim of which initially casts a shadow over the top part of his face but still reveals his eyes looking towards the viewer. He also wears a scarf with a houndstooth or similar checkered pattern around his neck. The plain sky serves as the background, occupying the right and top right areas of the frame. The camera, positioned at eye level, uses an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing sharply on the man in the foreground. Initially, the man looks towards the camera, but he then gradually lowers his head, causing the brim of the hat to obscure his left eye while his right eye remains visible, casting more of his face into shadow. His position within the frame remains largely unchanged. The camera executes a smooth, minor downward tilt, maintaining a position level with the subject. The black-and-white video presents this scene outdoors against a plain, light sky, with the man first looking towards the camera before lowering his head, bringing the hat brim further down over his face.",

    "Subject": "In the black-and-white video, a close-up focuses on a middle-aged or older man with light skin and visible wrinkles, particularly around his eyes. He has a short, graying beard and wears a dark fedora-style hat, the brim of which initially casts a shadow over the top part of his face but still reveals his eyes looking towards the viewer.

During the video, the man lowers his head, causing the brim of the hat to obscure his left eye while his right eye remains visible, casting more of his face into shadow.",
    "Motion": "The video features a close-up of a man wearing a hat and a checkered scarf against a plain background. The man initially looks towards the viewer, then gradually lowers his head, causing the brim of the hat to obscure his forehead while most of his face remains visible.",
    "Scene": "The black and white video presents a close-up view of a man outdoors against a plain, light sky. He is wearing a dark hat, the brim of which initially casts a shadow over the upper part of his face, and a patterned scarf around his neck. The man first looks towards the camera before lowering his head, bringing the hat brim further down over his face.",
    "Spatial": "This close-up shot frames a man primarily in the left and center foreground. His hat occupies the top left and center, while his scarf is visible at the bottom left and center. The plain sky serves as the background, occupying the right and top right areas of the frame. The camera maintains a position level with the subject. Initially, the man looks towards the camera, but he then lowers his head, causing the hat's brim to cover more of his face, especially his left eye, while his position within the frame remains largely unchanged."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
