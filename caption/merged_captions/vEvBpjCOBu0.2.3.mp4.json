  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot of an industrial complex, with no primary subject. The camera is positioned at a low angle, looking up at the structures. A large, multi-story factory building dominates the center of the frame in the middle ground, with a tall smokestack rising behind it on the left. To the right, intricate piping and another building extend into the background. The bottom of the frame is occupied by the tops of containers in the foreground. The camera executes a slow dolly movement forward and to the left, causing the foreground elements to drift across the screen and gradually revealing more of the industrial architecture on the left side of the scene. The video begins with a view of an industrial building, featuring a large structure with multiple levels and various mechanical components attached to it. The building has a modern design with large windows and metal frameworks, and there are several pipes and structures extending from it. As the camera moves to the left, more of the building's facade and surrounding structures come into view, including a tall chimney and additional industrial equipment. The sky in the background is partly cloudy, adding to the industrial atmosphere. The camera continues to move forward and leftward, revealing more details of the building's exterior and the surrounding area, including additional buildings and equipment. The scene is outdoors, featuring several buildings with corrugated metal siding and large glass windows. The architecture includes tall chimneys and complex piping systems, suggesting heavy industry. The time of day appears to be late afternoon, as the sunlight casts long shadows and highlights the metallic surfaces with a warm glow. The sky is overcast, adding a muted tone to the environment. The structures are characterized by their geometric shapes and industrial materials, such as steel and glass, with visible textures like rivets and paneling.",

    "Camera": "The video features a camera at eye level with a low angle, looking up. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera moves forward and to the left, with slight unsteadiness and some shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video is an industrial cityscape scenery shot. It focuses on the environment and atmosphere, highlighting the scale and complexity of industrial structures. The scene features large, metallic buildings with intricate piping and machinery, reflecting a utilitarian design. The lighting casts dramatic shadows, emphasizing the textures and geometric forms of the architecture. The absence of a main subject directs attention to the overall industrial landscape, creating a sense of vastness and functionality.",

    "Scene": "The video shows an industrial setting with large, metallic structures and machinery, likely a factory or power plant. The scene is outdoors, featuring several buildings with corrugated metal siding and large glass windows. The architecture includes tall chimneys and complex piping systems, suggesting heavy industry. The time of day appears to be late afternoon, as the sunlight casts long shadows and highlights the metallic surfaces with a warm glow. The sky is overcast, adding a muted tone to the environment. The structures are characterized by their geometric shapes and industrial materials, such as steel and glass, with visible textures like rivets and paneling. Overlay text in the bottom left corner reads \"[14] ; DW News - Luther and the Chemicals Industry (2013)\" but is not integrated into the scene and does not provide additional context.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
