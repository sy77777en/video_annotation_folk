  "merged_caption": "The video presents a consistent close-up shot of a middle-aged man with fair skin and dark brown, neatly styled hair parted on his left, whose head and shoulders are centrally positioned in the foreground of the frame. He is wearing a dark suit jacket over a white collared shirt and a dark patterned tie, with a blue lanyard and badge visible around his neck. The light blue-grey metallic elevator walls occupy the background, surrounding the man. The camera is at eye level, looking straight ahead, with a shallow depth of field focusing on the man in the foreground. It creates a \"dolly zoom\" effect by moving backward while simultaneously zooming in on the man, with the movement being very smooth. The man remains largely still, facing directly towards the camera. He blinks a few times throughout the video, initially with his mouth slightly open, then closing it briefly. His expression transitions from fear to calmness. The elevator walls reflect a soft, even light. The man has dark eyes and some stubble on his chin and upper lip. His facial expression is largely neutral, with his mouth slightly open at times, and he blinks during the sequence. There are no changes in shot size or the man's position within the frame throughout the clip.",

    "Scene": "The video shows a close-up of a man in a dark suit and white shirt, wearing a blue lanyard, standing in an elevator. The elevator walls are a plain, light blue-grey metallic material, reflecting a soft, even light. The man blinks slowly.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
