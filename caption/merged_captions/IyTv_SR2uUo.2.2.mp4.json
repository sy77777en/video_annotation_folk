  "merged_caption": "A wide shot frames a kayaker from a third-person perspective, positioned in the center foreground. The camera is mounted behind the subject, looking over their shoulders and the bow of their bright pink kayak, which occupies the bottom center of the frame. The kayaker, wearing red and yellow kayaking attire and a silver helmet with a Red Bull logo and a small camera mounted on top, paddles forward with a paddle that has a black shaft and black blades with a yellow pattern through whitewater, flanked by the tree-lined, rocky walls of a gorge that extend from the middle ground to the background on the left and right. The steep walls of the gorge are dark and shadowed, with dense green trees and foliage lining the sunlit banks above. As the kayaker goes over a waterfall, their position in the frame remains centered, but they move rapidly downward. The camera, locked in position behind them, tilts down, following the descent and shifting the view from a forward perspective to one looking directly down into the churning water at the base of the falls. The kayak plunges vertically down into a narrow, rocky gorge, and the kayaker raises their paddle as they fall. The camera, exhibiting mild barrel distortion, moves forward through a winding river. Initially at a level angle at water level, the camera plunges downward as the kayaker goes over a waterfall, shifting to a high angle. The movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking and a varying Dutch angle due to camera rolling. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp. The gorge walls appear to rise up on either side as the kayaker drops deeper into the canyon, culminating in a drop over a waterfall into the frothing water below.",

    "Camera": "This third-person video, which features a speed ramp effect, follows a kayaker from behind. The camera, exhibiting mild barrel distortion, moves forward through a winding river. Initially at a level angle at water level, the camera plunges downward as the kayaker goes over a waterfall, shifting to a high angle. The movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking and a varying Dutch angle due to camera rolling. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "A person is shown from a first-person perspective, kayaking down a narrow, rocky waterfall. The kayaker wears red and yellow kayaking attire. On their head is a silver helmet with a Red Bull logo on the side and a small camera mounted on top. They are actively paddling with a paddle that has a black shaft and black blades with a yellow pattern. The kayak they are in is bright pink with various logos visible on the front.",
    "Motion": "A kayaker paddles through whitewater and goes over the edge of a waterfall. The kayak plunges vertically down into a narrow, rocky gorge, and the kayaker raises their paddle as they fall.",
    "Scene": "From a locked-on POV shot fixed to the subject, the perspective is of a descent down a turbulent river confined within a narrow, rocky gorge. The steep walls of the gorge are dark and shadowed, with dense green trees and foliage lining the sunlit banks above. The view looks over the bow of a pink kayak as it navigates through churning whitewater, culminating in a drop over a waterfall into the frothing water below.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
