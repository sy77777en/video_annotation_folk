  "merged_caption": "The video is presented from a first-person perspective, with the weapon and gloved hands consistently occupying the lower center and foreground of the frame. The camera is at eye level, maintaining a level angle and deep focus, keeping all elements in the scene sharp. The video begins in a bright hallway featuring patterned floors, carpet, and decorative wallpaper. A large, gold-framed portrait of a uniformed figure is positioned on the left side of the frame and middle ground, mounted on the wall above a bench, while a bright room with sofas and a wood-paneled door appears on the right side and extends into the background. The individual moves forward through the hallway while holding a black assault rifle, passing the large portrait on the wall. The camera initially trucks slightly to the right, then midway gently pans left to adjust its facing. Movement is slightly unsteady, with some shaking, reflecting the handheld or in-game viewpoint. As the individual continues advancing, the camera transitions directly into a dimly lit corridor with checkered flooring, which occupies the middle ground and leads deeper into the background. This corridor connects to a dimly lit room resembling a kitchen or storage area, containing shelves on the right, cabinets in the center, and various items scattered across the countertops and floor. The camera remains at the subject’s eye level, maintaining a consistent height relative to the weapon and hands. Overlay elements, such as a compass and direction indicator at the top, mission instructions below, a white location icon beneath that, and weapon status information in the lower right corner, are fixed at the top and bottom of the frame and do not interact with the physical space. The mission objective text overlay reads “Escape through the north-side tunnel.” The spatial framing emphasizes forward movement through connected interior spaces.",

    "Camera": "The video is presented from an eye-level, first-person perspective typical of an FPS game, with the camera at a level angle looking straight ahead. The camera maintains deep focus, keeping all elements in the scene sharp. The camera moves forward throughout the video, initially trucking slightly to the right, and midway gently panning left to adjust its facing. Movement is slightly unsteady, with some shaking, reflecting the handheld or in-game viewpoint. The camera’s focus remains on the player's path and immediate environment as they navigate through interior spaces.",
    "Subject": "The video shows a first-person perspective of an individual holding a black assault rifle with a visible ammunition counter, moving through an indoor environment. The person’s hands, covered by tactical gloves, grip the weapon. A large, framed portrait of a man in a military uniform with a mustache and medals is prominently displayed on a wall. In another area, a dimly lit corridor with checkered flooring is visible, and an on-screen objective text instructs to \"Escape through the north-side tunnel.\" No other people or animals are clearly visible, and the focus remains on the weapon, the portrait, and the interior spaces navigated by the armed individual.",
    "Motion": "The individual moves forward through a hallway while holding a black assault rifle, passing a large portrait on the wall. The person continues advancing into a dimly lit corridor with checkered flooring, maintaining a steady grip on the weapon and navigating the indoor environment without visible interaction with other people or animals.",
    "Scene": "The video begins in a bright hallway featuring patterned floors, carpet, and decorative wallpaper. A large, gold-framed portrait of a uniformed figure is prominently displayed on the left wall. To the right, a brighter area with several sofas and a wood-paneled door is visible. A narrow, dimly lit hallway connects these spaces, leading the character into a dimly lit room that resembles a kitchen or storage area. This room contains shelves on the right, cabinets in the center, and various items scattered across the countertops and floor. Overlay elements include a compass and direction indicator at the top, mission instructions below, a white location icon beneath that, and weapon status information in the lower right corner. The mission objective text overlay reads “Escape through the north-side tunnel.” These overlays are superimposed on the video for informational purposes and are not part of the physical environment.",
    "Spatial": "The video is presented from a first-person perspective, with the weapon and gloved hands consistently occupying the lower center and foreground of the frame. In the initial scene, a large, gold-framed portrait is positioned on the left side of the frame and middle ground, mounted on the wall above a bench, while a bright room with sofas and a door appears on the right side and extends into the background. The patterned floor and decorative wallpaper are visible throughout the foreground and middle ground. As the individual moves forward, the camera transitions directly into a dimly lit corridor with checkered flooring, which occupies the middle ground and leads deeper into the background. The camera remains at the subject’s eye level, maintaining a consistent height relative to the weapon and hands.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
