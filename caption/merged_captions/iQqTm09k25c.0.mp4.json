  "merged_caption": "This wide shot, captured from a static, subject-level camera position, frames a padel match from behind one team's side of the court. The camera is positioned at eye level, looking straight ahead, and employs deep focus, ensuring all elements on the court are sharp and clear. In the foreground, two players are positioned on the bottom left and bottom right of the frame. The team closer to the camera features a player in a dark blue outfit with a cap and their partner in black with white accents. In the middle ground, their two opponents are positioned on the opposite side of a central net. The opposing team consists of a man in a red shirt and black shorts, standing near the net, and his partner in a white and gray patterned shirt and shorts, captured mid-jump, swinging his racket. The court occupies the lower half of the frame, enclosed by glass walls on the sides and in the background. Behind the far wall, a series of banners with text in Spanish, including 'RIO GALLEGOS - ARGENTINA,' and empty tiered spectator seating are visible. Throughout the sequence, all four players move dynamically forward and backward between the net and the rear of the court, as well as laterally within their respective sides, to engage in a continuous rally. The man in the red shirt is seen jumping and swinging his racket to return the ball, while his teammate is positioned to support. The players closer to the camera are also in motion, with the player in the dark blue outfit moving to intercept the ball. The environment is well-lit, suggesting an indoor arena with artificial lighting, and the overall atmosphere is energetic, with the focus on the sporting action within the enclosed court.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
