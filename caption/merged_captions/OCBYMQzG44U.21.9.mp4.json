  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a wide shot, looking down from a high angle. A white spiral staircase occupies the center and left middle ground, descending towards a pool of light green water that fills the lower middle ground and background. A metal railing is in the immediate foreground at the bottom of the frame, with another railing following the staircase. White columns with dark green bases are positioned in the background around the pool, and a small, blurred yellow rubber duck toy is visible in the water at the bottom center middle ground. The camera exhibits mild barrel distortion and starts with a static, high-angle view, then quickly pans left 180 degrees to a rear view, incorporating a slight upward tilt that transitions the view to a level angle. The movement is very smooth and rapid. As the camera pans left and tilts upward, the scene transitions to another area with white tiled floors and walls, the latter featuring a band of dark grey textured material and several tall, narrow, rounded windows emitting bright light. The camera maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field throughout. In this new view, a white tiled floor extends from the bottom foreground to the background, while white tiled walls extend from the foreground to the background. A dark grey textured band runs horizontally across these walls, and several tall, narrow, rounded windows emitting bright light are situated on the right background wall. The wall appears curved due to barrel distortion, not its actual shape. The small orange object, possibly a rubber duck, is later seen on the tiled floor of this room. There is no main subject because the focus is on the overall architectural design, the sterile yet intriguing atmosphere, and the interplay of light and shadow within these spaces, rather than on any particular entity or object.",

    "Subject": "This video presents an interior architectural scenery shot, characterized by its clean, minimalist, and somewhat surreal aesthetic. It depicts a white, tiled environment, initially showing a spiral staircase with a metal railing descending into a pool of light green water, surrounded by white columns with dark green bases. A blurred yellow rubber duck toy is located in the pool at the bottom of the frame. As the camera pans left and tilts upward, the scene transitions to another area with white tiled floors and walls, the latter featuring a band of dark grey textured material and several tall, narrow, rounded windows emitting bright light.

    "Motion": "The video shows a white tiled room with a spiral staircase leading down into a pool of water. The camera then pans to another area of the room, revealing more white tiles and some dark grey sections on the wall. There is no subject motion in this brief clip.",
    "Scene": "The video captures an indoor, tiled environment. Initially, the view is from above a white spiral staircase with a metal railing, which descends around a large central pillar into light teal water where a small orange object, possibly a rubber duck, floats. White cylindrical pillars with dark green bases line the perimeter. The camera is positioned next to the railing on the second floor, looking down. It then pans left and tilts upward to reveal the scene on the second floor after ascending the staircase, primarily showcasing the white tiled floor, walls, and the glowing elements on the walls, which could be either light fixtures or windows. The wall appears curved due to barrel distortion, not its actual shape. The small orange object is later seen on the tiled floor of this room.",

The camera then pans left and tilts upward, shifting to a wide shot of an interior space. In this new view, a white tiled floor extends from the bottom foreground to the background, while white tiled walls extend from the foreground to the background. A dark grey textured band runs horizontally across these walls, and several tall, narrow, rounded windows emitting bright light are situated on the right background wall."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
