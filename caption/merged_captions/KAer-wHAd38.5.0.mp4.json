  "merged_caption": "The video captures a rural landscape with a wide shot, featuring a paved road that occupies the center and lower part of the frame. The road extends from the foreground into the middle ground, curving gently in both directions. On the right side of the frame in the middle ground, a low stone wall, a white metal gate, and a cross-shaped metal structure are visible, with a yellow triangular road sign positioned near the wall and adjacent to other dilapidated buildings. The left side of the frame showcases green grass and low vegetation in the foreground and middle ground, with a pond and trees further back. In the background, several houses with red roofs are visible, mostly toward the center and right of the frame, surrounded by trees and shrubs. The sky, filled with large white clouds, dominates the upper half of the frame and forms the background. A black car appears in the middle ground, approaching the camera from a distance, turning left at the intersection, and then moving from left to right across the frame. The camera is positioned at approximately road level, matching the height of the road and the car, and remains stationary throughout the scene. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, using deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. Likely mounted on a smoothly moving vehicle, the camera moves forward along the road with minimal shaking, maintaining a clear view of the road and the approaching intersection. The video is a rural landscape scenery shot, capturing a quiet, sunlit country road that gently curves through a verdant area under a vast, partly cloudy sky. The scene features lush greenery along the roadside, a few scattered houses, and a tranquil atmosphere enhanced by the expansive blue sky filled with billowing white clouds.",

    "Subject": "The video is a rural landscape scenery shot, capturing a quiet, sunlit country road that gently curves through a verdant area under a vast, partly cloudy sky. The scene features lush greenery along the roadside, a few scattered houses, and a tranquil atmosphere enhanced by the expansive blue sky filled with billowing white clouds. The focus is on the environment and the sense of open space, emphasizing the peacefulness and scale of the rural setting rather than highlighting any specific object or individual, which is why there is no main subject in the video.",
    "Motion": "In the beginning, a car is visible driving towards the intersection before it turns left, moving to the right side of the frame. The images capture a peaceful rural road under a bright blue sky with scattered clouds, featuring greenery and a few houses. The video likely showcases a calm, scenic drive or walk through this countryside area.",
    "Scene": "The video takes place outdoors on a rural road under a bright blue sky scattered with large, white clouds. The road is paved and curves gently, bordered by patches of green grass and low vegetation on both sides. On the right, a low stone wall and a white metal gate mark the entrance to a property with a small building, while a cross-shaped metal structure rises above the wall. Further along, a yellow triangular road sign with a red border and a black cross mark in the middle is mounted on a post near the wall. In the distance, a few houses with red roofs are visible, surrounded by trees and shrubs. The scene includes a black car moving across an intersection where the road splits, with the car’s dark, glossy surface reflecting sunlight. The overall environment is quiet and open, with no overlays or text present in the video.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
