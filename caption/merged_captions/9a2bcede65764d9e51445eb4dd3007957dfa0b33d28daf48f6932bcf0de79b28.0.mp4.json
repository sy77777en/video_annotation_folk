  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot of Independence Hall in Philadelphia. Initially, a green lawn occupies the foreground at the bottom of the frame. The red-brick Independence Hall, designed in the Georgian style, is centered in the middle ground, featuring numerous white-trimmed windows, a white balustrade along the roofline, and a prominent central clock tower topped with a steeple. A statue on a stone pedestal is positioned centrally in front of it, and an American flag on a tall flagpole is located in the top left middle ground. Trees flank the building on both the left and right. In the background, modern glass and stone skyscrapers are visible behind the historic structure, with the sky at the top of the frame. The camera, from an eye-level perspective with a deep focus, initially positioned at a level angle, smoothly tilts upward, causing the lawn to move out of the bottom of the frame while revealing more of the building's iconic clock tower and the skyscrapers rising behind it. The view transitions to a low angle, gradually revealing the full height of the clock tower against the pale sky. The scene is framed by a lush green lawn in the foreground and trees on either side, with the historical architecture contrasting with the modern skyline. The manicured green lawn and symmetrical arcades flanking the main structure contribute to the sense of place and historical significance. The shot captures the overall environment and atmosphere, emphasizing the scale of the landmark and its place within the urban landscape, rather than a specific object or individual. The scene is captured at either dawn or dusk, adding to the ambiance of the setting.",

The central focus is the large, two-story red-brick building, designed in the Georgian style, featuring numerous white-trimmed windows, a white balustrade along the roofline, and a prominent central clock tower topped with a steeple. The main building is flanked by lower, matching brick wings with open, arched colonnades. In the foreground, a manicured green lawn is separated from a paved plaza by a low fence with brown posts and chains. A bronze statue of a figure stands on a stone pedestal in the center of the plaza. To the left, an American flag is raised on a tall flagpole. In the background, the historical architecture contrasts with modern glass and stone skyscrapers and is framed by lush green trees.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
