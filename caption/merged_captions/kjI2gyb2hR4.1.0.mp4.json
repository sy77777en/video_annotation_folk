  "merged_caption": "This close-up shot captures a person's foot and sneaker positioned in the foreground, initially in the center of the frame. The lower part of their black pants occupies the top center of the frame. Below the foot, a multi-colored court with grey, blue, and red sections is visible in the middle ground and background, filling the bottom half of the frame. A blurred beige wall is situated in the background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level. Throughout the clip, the foot, wearing a low-top Nike Air Jordan 1 sneaker with a red toe box, white side panels, a black Nike swoosh, a black textured heel counter, a small gold accent on the heel tab, an off-white midsole, and a red outsole, moves forward towards the left side of the frame, starting in the center and later shifting to a position slightly above the center. This slow-motion, ground-level video smoothly tracks the shoe from the side by moving left. The camera, which is at a level angle, simultaneously rolls clockwise and moves forward, causing the shoe to grow larger in the frame and creating a varying Dutch angle. A shallow depth of field keeps the focus locked on the shoe in the foreground. The indoor setting features a court painted in sections of grey, blue, and red, with white lines separating the colors, and a beige wall visible in the blurred background.",

    "Subject": "A close-up shot focuses on a person's foot and lower leg suspended in mid-air. The person wears wide-leg black pants and a low-top Nike Air Jordan 1 sneaker. The shoe features a red toe box, white side panels, and a black Nike swoosh. The heel counter is made of a black, textured material, and a small gold accent is visible on the heel tab. The shoe has an off-white midsole and a red outsole.",
    "Motion": "A person's foot, wearing a sneaker, is moving forward in mid-air above a multi-colored court.",
    "Scene": "In an indoor setting, a person's foot is captured in motion, moving forward above a multi-colored court. The person wears black pants and a low-top sneaker with a red toe, a white mid-panel, a black swoosh, and a textured black heel. The shoe features an off-white midsole and a red outsole. The court below is painted in sections of grey, blue, and red, with white lines separating the colors. A beige wall is visible in the blurred background.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
