  "merged_caption": "This video is presented in a split-screen format. The left panel contains a full shot of a young woman with fair skin and dark hair with bangs in a dark blue police uniform, occupying most of the frame with her body, while her torso and head are positioned in the center-left. She is seated with her feet propped up on a desk in the foreground, holding a red rotary phone to her ear while speaking. Her police hat rests on her lap, also in the foreground. In the middle ground to the right, a desk lamp provides focused light on the area, with a filing cabinet in the background. The camera is positioned at a hip-level, level angle, employing a shallow focus to keep the police officer in the middle ground sharp while the background is blurred. On the right half of the split screen, a high-angle shot of a vintage-style bathroom shows a middle-aged man with short brown hair in a yellow argyle sweater over a collared shirt and tie, standing in the right foreground, talking on a light blue corded phone with a distressed expression. To his left, in the middle ground, three other people are gathered around a pink sink: a woman in a bathrobe with a pink towel wrapped around her head, another woman with blonde hair in a blue checkered dress and slippers, and a child with brown hair wearing a red hat. The two women appear anxious and seem to be supporting the child, with their hands clasped together on the counter as if in prayer. In the center background, a striped shower curtain is initially closed but is then pulled back to reveal another person's head peeking out from the shower area. The camera is positioned at eye-level, filming from a high angle, using deep focus to ensure all the people in the bathroom are clearly visible.",

    "Subject": "This video is presented in a split-screen format, displaying two distinct scenes simultaneously. On the left, a young woman with fair skin and dark hair with bangs is shown in a dark blue police uniform, complete with an American flag patch on her sleeve. She is sitting back in a chair with her feet propped up on a desk, holding a red rotary telephone to her ear while speaking. Her police hat rests on her lap. On the right, a scene unfolds in a bathroom where a middle-aged man with short brown hair, wearing a yellow argyle sweater over a collared shirt and tie, stands while talking on a light blue telephone with a distressed expression. To the left of the man, three people are present: a woman on the far left wearing a bathrobe with a pink towel wrapped around her head, revealing some dark hair; another woman with blonde hair in a blue checkered dress and slippers, positioned between the first woman and the man; and a child with brown hair wearing a red hat. The two women appear anxious and seem to be supporting the child, with their hands clasped together on the counter as if in prayer. In the background, a person with dark hair peeks out from behind a striped shower curtain, wearing a white collared dress shirt and a black tie, looking at the group.",
    "Motion": "On the left, a woman in a police uniform sits back in a chair with her feet on a desk, speaking into a red telephone. On the right, a man in a yellow sweater stands and gestures with one hand while speaking into a blue telephone. Beside the sink, a woman in a checkered dress leans over a child, while another woman in a bathrobe moves anxiously behind them. A person's head emerges from behind a shower curtain in the background to observe the scene.",
    "Scene": "The scene is presented in a split-screen format, displaying two distinct indoor locations. The left panel shows a dimly lit office where a person in a police uniform is seated with their feet on a desk, speaking into a red rotary phone. A desk lamp provides focused light on the area, and a filing cabinet is visible in the background. The right panel offers a high-angle view of a vintage-style bathroom with an off-white sink and a pink countertop. A man in a yellow sweater is on a light blue corded phone. The bathroom also contains a striped shower curtain, white blinds, and other individuals gathered near the sink.",
    "Spatial": "This video is presented in a split-screen format.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
