  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a man with short black hair and a darker complexion, wearing a red zip-up jacket with a white logo featuring different patterns on each side on the right chest, positioned in the center of the frame, standing on a reddish-brown athletics track with white lane markings in the middle ground. The camera, from a high, overhead angle, maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field and starts with a slight pan to the right. As the man in the red jacket looks downward and steps forward, ascending onto a platform, a second man with short black hair, wearing a light blue jacket with \"MYANMAR\" written in white capital letters across the back, enters from the bottom right, moving into the foreground. The camera follows with a quick downward tilt to frame the two men, causing the framing to tighten to a medium close-up. The first man is now positioned in the center of the middle ground, while the second man occupies the bottom right foreground. The man in blue extends his arms toward the center of the frame to place a medal attached to a red ribbon around the neck of the man in red, who bows his head to receive it. The camera then remains stationary for the rest of the video, exhibiting noticeable but not extreme shakiness throughout. The scene is captured from a slightly elevated, static viewpoint during the day, with the man in the blue jacket placing the medal around the neck of the man in the red jacket, who bows his head as the medal is presented.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
