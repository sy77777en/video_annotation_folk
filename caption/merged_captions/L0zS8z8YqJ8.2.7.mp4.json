  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of a grey train's observation car, initially positioned in the right foreground and moving towards the right through a green, hilly landscape with trees during the day. The camera, at a level angle, matches the train's pace to keep its position constant in the frame. The camera moves alongside the exterior of the grey train car, then quickly moves backward while simultaneously shifting right and panning left, smoothly entering the train's cabin through a window. Inside, the scene features a wide shot with numerous identical mannequins seated in rows of dark, high-backed chairs. These humanoid figures have a smooth, reflective, chrome-like surface and lack any discernible facial features. A mannequin in a chair occupies the left foreground, while a large pillar stands in the center of the frame, flanked by rows of seated mannequins on both sides, creating depth leading to the back of the car. The background showcases the passing landscape through large panoramic windows lining the car's sides. The camera slowly pans from right to left until the train interior is symmetrically centered in the frame, revealing the mannequins posed sitting upright, looking out the large panoramic windows at the passing scenery. While the train continues to move forward, as seen through the passing scenery in the windows, the mannequins remain completely motionless in their seats. The interior shot includes a subtle, continuous pan to the left, enhancing the sense of movement. A deep focus is maintained throughout the shot, keeping the entire scene sharp. The dimly lit car features a central pillar in the middle, and an overlay at the bottom left corner of the frame displays the text \"[2].\"",

    "Camera": "This video features a dynamic and smooth camera movement. The shot begins from an overhead-level,  level angle perspective outside the train. The camera then moves quickly backward while simultaneously shifting right and panning left, smoothly entering the train's cabin. As it moves inside, the camera's perspective remains level, capturing the interior from the front. A deep focus is maintained throughout the shot, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "The video features a grey train observation car, shown from both the exterior and interior. Inside the dimly lit car, numerous identical mannequins are seated in rows of dark, high-backed chairs. These humanoid figures have a smooth, reflective, chrome-like surface and lack any discernible facial features. All the mannequins are posed sitting upright, looking out the large panoramic windows.",
    "Motion": "The camera moves alongside the exterior of a grey train car as it travels along a track. The view then transitions to the interior, where the camera slowly pans from right to left until the train interior is symmetrically centered in the frame, revealing numerous seated mannequins. While the train continues to move forward, as seen through the passing scenery in the windows, the mannequins remain completely motionless in their seats.",
    "Scene": "The video shows a grey train car with a dark stripe traveling on tracks through a green, hilly landscape with trees during the day. The scene transitions from an exterior view to the interior of an observation car, which is dimly lit and features large, panoramic windows. Inside, rows of high-backed chairs are occupied by metallic, humanoid figures looking out at the passing scenery. A central pillar stands in the middle of the car. An overlay at the bottom left corner of the frame displays the text \"[2].\"",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a wide shot of a train's observation car, initially positioned in the right foreground and moving towards the right. The camera, at a level angle, matches the train's pace to keep its position constant in the frame. As the camera moves right, it smoothly pans left, transitioning from the exterior to the interior of the train through a window. Inside, the scene features a wide shot with the seated figures. A mannequin in a chair occupies the left foreground, while a large pillar stands in the center of the frame, flanked by rows of seated mannequins on both sides, creating depth leading to the back of the car.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
