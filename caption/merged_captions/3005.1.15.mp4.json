  "merged_caption": "This medium shot, filmed at the subjects' level and played in reverse, frames a man in the foreground on the left who appears to be lowering himself onto a bench. A gray duffel bag rests on the bench next to him in the center foreground. In the middle ground, another man is seated on a bench to the right of the center, leaning forward to tie the laces of his white sneakers. In the background on the far right, a third man is walking backward toward a doorway, facing the right side of the frame but moving from right to left in reverse. The video is captured from a static, hip-level camera with a level angle, using a shallow depth of field that keeps the person in the foreground in focus while blurring the background. The scene is set within a dimly lit locker room, characterized by rows of tall, gray metal lockers along the left side. Simple benches with wooden slat tops and black metal frames are positioned in the space. The environment is illuminated by a strong, directional light likely shining through windows on the background wall, creating a stark contrast with the deep shadows and highlighting dust motes in the air. The overall color palette is cool, dominated by blues and grays. In the background, an open doorway offers a glimpse into an adjacent area. Several people in dark athletic attire are scattered throughout the room, with one sitting on a bench and another walking in the distance. The man in the foreground wears a dark blue long-sleeved shirt and dark blue pants, while the man tying his shoelaces is also dressed in a dark blue long-sleeved shirt and dark pants. The third man in the background wears a dark top and light-colored bottoms.",

    "Camera": "This time-reversed video is captured from a static, hip-level camera with a level angle. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the person in the foreground in focus while blurring the background.",
    "Subject": "In a locker room, a man in the foreground transitions from standing to sitting, wearing a dark blue long-sleeved shirt and dark blue pants. To his right, another man with dark hair sits on a bench, leaning forward to tie the laces of his white sneakers; he is also dressed in a dark blue long-sleeved shirt and dark pants. In the background, a third man moves throughout the video, wearing a dark top and light-colored bottoms, facing towards the right side of the frame with his side to the camera. Due to the video being played in reverse, he moves from right to left.",
    "Motion": "A man in the foreground lowers himself to sit on a bench. In the mid-ground, another man remains seated and leans forward, tying his shoelaces. In the background, a third man moves backward from the right side toward an open doorway in the middle-right, as the video is played in reverse.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
