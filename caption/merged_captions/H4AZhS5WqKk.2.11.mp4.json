  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a medium, slightly high-angle shot of a green glass champagne bottle with a gold and white label standing upright near the upper center of the frame on a textured, light green blanket made up of tightly packed, hexagonal, cushion-like shapes in muted green tones. The camera is positioned directly on the bed at a moderately high angle, looking slightly downward, and is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement. It uses a shallow depth of field, focusing on the midground where the bottle is located, while the foreground and background remain out of focus, with soft, out-of-focus elements suggesting bedding or fabric in pale colors. As the bottle begins to tip forward toward the camera, its neck angles slightly to the lower right, moving to the center-right area of the frame. At this moment, Jerry, a small brown mouse with large pink ears, a tan face and belly, and a thin tail, dynamically enters the scene from the upper right middle ground. He nimbly leaps diagonally downward over the path of the falling bottle, showcasing his agility, and lands on the left side of the frame. Jerry opens his arms in a showmanship gesture, smiling at the bottle. The bottle comes to rest on its side on the blanket, and liquid starts to leak out. The spatial dynamic is highlighted by the bottle's movement toward the camera and Jerry's jump, resulting in both subjects sharing the middle ground but occupying opposite sides of the frame by the end of the shot. The lighting is soft and even, indicating daytime or well-lit indoor conditions, and the overall setting combines realistic and animated elements, with the animated character seamlessly integrated into the environment.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned directly on the bed at a moderately high angle, looking slightly downward. It is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, focusing on the midground—specifically, the area where the bottle and Jerry (the animated mouse) are located—while the foreground and background remain out of focus.",
    "Subject": "The video begins with a green glass champagne bottle with a gold and white label standing upright on a textured, light green blanket. The bottle tips over, falling towards the camera. At this moment, the cartoon character Jerry, a small brown mouse with large pink ears, a tan face and belly, and a thin tail, appears from the upper right corner. Jerry nimbly jumps under the falling bottle and lands on the left side of the frame. He opens his arms in a showmanship gesture, smiling at the bottle. As the bottle comes to rest on its side on the blanket, liquid begins to leak out.",
    "Motion": "The champagne bottle stands upright on the blanket, then begins to tip over toward the camera. As it does, Jerry dynamically enters the scene from the upper right corner. He skillfully jumps beneath the falling bottle to the left side of the frame, showcasing his agility with a showmanship gesture while facing the bottle. The bottle comes to rest on its side, and liquid starts to leak out onto the blanket.",
    "Scene": "The video takes place indoors on a textured surface made up of tightly packed, hexagonal, cushion-like shapes in muted green tones. A green-glass bottle with a gold and white label falls onto the surface, with some liquid spilling out. As the bottle falls, Jerry, an animated mouse character with brown fur, large pink ears, and a light-colored belly, appears from the upper right corner and nimbly leaps under the bottle, moving to the left side of the frame. In the background, there are soft, out-of-focus elements suggesting bedding or fabric in pale colors. The lighting is soft and even, indicating daytime or well-lit indoor conditions. The overall setting combines realistic and animated elements, with the animated character seamlessly integrated into the environment.",
    "Spatial": "The video starts with a medium, slightly high-angle shot of a green glass champagne bottle standing upright near the upper center of the frame on a textured, light green blanket. As the bottle tips forward toward the camera, its neck angles slightly to the lower right, moving to the center-right area of the frame. At the same time, Jerry, the cartoon mouse, appears from the upper right middle ground, leaping diagonally downward over the path of the falling bottle and landing on the left side of the frame. The camera maintains a slightly high angle, capturing both the bottle and Jerry against the textured blanket in the foreground and out-of-focus bedding or fabric elements in the background. The spatial dynamic is highlighted by the bottle's movement toward the camera and Jerry's jump, resulting in both subjects sharing the middle ground but occupying opposite sides of the frame by the end of the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
