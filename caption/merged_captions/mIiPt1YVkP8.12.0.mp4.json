  "merged_caption": "In an extreme wide shot taken from a high angle, a white passenger airplane is positioned in the center-left of the frame, slowly moving from left to right on a taxiway in the middle ground. The airport's runways and taxiways extend from the foreground to the middle ground, interspersed with sections of brown grass. A body of water occupies the background, with a faint city skyline visible at the top of the frame in the far background. The camera, from a high, aerial perspective, maintains a deep focus on the airport scene, smoothly panning right and tilting down, gradually zooming in to follow the white airplane as it slowly moves to the right on the runway. The airport features a complex layout of light brown runways and taxiways, marked with white and yellow lines, set against brown, grassy terrain. In the hazy, orange-tinted background, suggesting either dawn or dusk, a body of water separates the airport from a distant city skyline.",

    "Scene": "From a high-angle perspective, an airport is depicted under a hazy, orange-tinted sky, suggesting either dawn or dusk. A single white passenger airplane is positioned on a taxiway at the intersection with a long, light brown runway marked with white lines. The runway and surrounding light brown taxiways, detailed with yellow lines, are set within expanses of brown grass. In the background, a faint city skyline is visible across a body of water.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
