  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot of a young Black man with short, black, twisted hair, seated in the middle ground playing a black electronic keyboard positioned in the foreground against a large, textured wall with a mottled, light-grey and beige finish that resembles concrete or plaster. He is wearing a short-sleeved, dark blue button-up shirt over a grey t-shirt, paired with light brown pants, and a black beaded bracelet on his right wrist. Initially, he occupies the lower two-thirds of the frame, focusing on a sheet of paper positioned above the piano. As he plays, his attention shifts to the piano keys, and his fingers press them while his hands move along the instrument. He sways his upper body slightly while playing. The camera, capturing the scene from an eye-level, level angle, maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp as it smoothly and slowly dollies backward, gradually revealing more of the keyboard and the man. As the camera pulls back, transitioning to a full shot, the man shifts to occupy the lower half of the frame, seated on a simple wooden stool. Throughout this movement, the keyboard remains in the bottom foreground, and the man's position adjusts from the center to the bottom-center of the frame. By the end, his focus returns to the sheet music on the stand. The environment is evenly lit, creating a neutral and minimalist setting, and the camera maintains a level angle with the subject, ensuring a clear view of the entire scene as it unfolds.",

    "Camera": "This slow-motion video captures a young man playing the piano from an eye-level, level angle. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp as it smoothly and slowly dollies backward, moving away from the musician.",
    "Subject": "A young Black man with short, black, twisted hair is seated and playing a black electronic keyboard. He is wearing a short-sleeved, dark blue button-up shirt over a grey t-shirt, paired with light brown pants. On his right wrist, he wears a black beaded bracelet. His focus alternates between looking at a sheet of paper positioned above the piano and looking down at his hands as they move across the piano keys.",

    "Scene": "The scene is set indoors against a large, textured wall with a mottled, light-grey and beige finish that resembles concrete or plaster. In the middle ground, a young man is seated on a simple wooden stool, playing a black electronic keyboard. The environment is evenly lit, creating a neutral and minimalist setting. Throughout the shot, the camera slowly pulls back, gradually widening the view to include more of the keyboard and the simple surroundings.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
