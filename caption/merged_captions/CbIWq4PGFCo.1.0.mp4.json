  "merged_caption": "A close-up shot frames a young, fair-skinned man with short, curly brown hair in the center foreground. He wears a dark-colored t-shirt, and his face has some dirt on it, with red-rimmed, watery eyes. He looks downward with a somber expression as his face is partially lit from the side. The scene is set in a desolate, outdoor landscape under warm, directional light, with the ground being an uneven, sandy surface of a light brown color. In the out-of-focus background, dark, irregular mounds of earth or rock are cast in deep shadow. The camera, filmed from a level, eye-level perspective, slowly and smoothly arcs counterclockwise around him, capturing his head and shoulders. It maintains an extremely shallow depth of field, keeping the focus on the man in the foreground. The man remains completely still throughout the video, looking downward with a fixed expression. A strong light source from the side illuminates the foreground, creating a high-contrast environment where the young man is seated. There are no changes in the shot size or the subject's position throughout the video.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
