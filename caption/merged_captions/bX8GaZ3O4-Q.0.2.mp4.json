  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a close-up on a fluted metal rod, which is angled diagonally from the bottom left to the top right of the frame. A small, slender tree frog with bright, light-green skin and a distinct reddish-brown stripe running from its large, coppery eye down the side of its body enters from the bottom left middle ground and climbs up the rod, moving toward the center. The frog's limbs are also green, and its visible toe pads are a light reddish-pink color. As it moves, the framing adjusts to a full shot of the frog, which then pauses in the middle ground, positioned centrally on the rod. The frog pulls its body forward with its limbs, and after pausing its ascent, it rests its head on its right forelimb. It then lifts its head and looks to its right. A white plastic fitting is visible at the top right, attached to the end of the rod, while the background is composed of out-of-focus green foliage. The scene is set in a sunlit outdoor environment, with bright light creating a slight haze and reflecting off the pole's surface as the frog makes its way upward. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the shot, using an extremely shallow depth of field to focus on the frog in the midground and blur the surrounding foliage. This is a fixed, slightly unsteady shot filmed from a level angle.",

    "Subject": "A small, slender tree frog with bright, light-green skin is shown climbing a fluted, silver-colored metal rod. The frog has a distinct reddish-brown stripe running from its large, coppery eye down the side of its body. Its limbs are also green, and its visible toe pads are a light reddish-pink color. The frog moves up the rod, its body pressed against the surface, before pausing. The rod it is climbing has a white plastic fitting attached to its top end.",
    "Motion": "A small green tree frog climbs up a fluted metal rod, pulling its body forward with its limbs. After pausing its ascent, the frog rests its head on its right forelimb. It then lifts its head and looks to its right.",
    "Scene": "In a sunlit outdoor setting, a small green frog climbs a fluted, metallic-looking pole. The pole, which has a white, ringed fitting at its top, is positioned against a soft-focus background of lush green foliage. The bright light creates a slight haze and reflects off the pole's surface as the frog makes its way upward.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
