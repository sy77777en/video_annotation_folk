  "merged_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a landscape scene. The composition is layered, with a body of water in the foreground at the bottom of the frame, reflecting the sky. A vast, green field occupies the middle ground, stretching across the horizontal center. In the background, the horizon is positioned in the lower half of the frame, with the sun setting near the center and distant trees silhouetted against the sky. The sky itself fills the upper half of the frame. As the time-lapse progresses, the sun moves downward toward the horizon, and the clouds drift slowly across the sky, ranging from dark and brooding to light and ethereal. The overall scene darkens into twilight, causing the field and foreground elements to become silhouettes, while the reflection in the water mirrors the dynamic changes in the sky. The camera is positioned at a level angle, close to the water's edge, maintaining a deep focus to keep the entire landscape sharp. The shot features a very smooth zoom-out, gradually widening the view of the dramatic sky and its reflection in the water. The ambient light fades, casting the lush landscape and distant trees into dark silhouettes against the colorful sky. The shot intentionally lacks a main subject, instead emphasizing the immersive atmosphere and the grand scale of the natural scene, allowing the viewer to be captivated by the dynamic beauty of the changing light and the cloud-filled sky.",

    "Camera": "This time-lapse video is captured from a level angle, eye-level perspective. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire landscape sharp. The shot features a very smooth zoom-out, gradually widening the view of the dramatic sky and its reflection in the water.",
    "Subject": "The video presents a time-lapse landscape scenery shot of a dramatic sunset over a vast, verdant field. The sky is a canvas of swirling clouds, ranging from dark and brooding to light and ethereal, all set against the warm, golden-yellow light of the sun sinking below the horizon. A still body of water in the foreground acts as a perfect mirror, reflecting the entire celestial display with stunning clarity. As the time-lapse progresses, the ambient light fades, casting the lush landscape and distant trees into dark silhouettes against the colorful sky. The shot intentionally lacks a main subject, instead emphasizing the immersive atmosphere and the grand scale of the natural scene, allowing the viewer to be captivated by the dynamic beauty of the changing light and the cloud-filled sky.",
    "Motion": "This is a time-lapse video of a dramatic sunset over a lush, green field. The clouds drift slowly across the sky as the sun sets on the horizon, causing the entire scene to darken. The beautiful, cloudy sky is reflected in the still water in the foreground.",
    "Scene": "A time-lapse captures a sunset over a vast, green field. In the foreground, a body of still water reflects the dramatic sky, which is filled with a mix of dark, heavy clouds and lighter, wispy formations. As the video progresses, the golden sun sinks toward the horizon, and the overall scene darkens into twilight, with the clouds continuing to move across the sky. Distant trees and structures are silhouetted against the fading light on the horizon.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
