  "merged_caption": "This video presents a wide shot of the magnificent Siena Cathedral in Italy, captured from a low angle with a fisheye distortion. Initially, the cathedral's ornate Gothic facade, constructed from white and dark-striped marble, is centered in the frame, occupying the middle ground. The facade features three large arched portals, numerous spires, and intricate sculptures, with a large, plain circular glass window in the center below a triangular gable adorned with a golden mosaic. The foreground consists of a road at the bottom of the frame, while buildings on the left and right frame the central structure. The sky, a brilliant blue filled with fluffy white clouds, occupies the background at the top of the frame. The camera performs a slightly unsteady counterclockwise arc around the cathedral, utilizing deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. This movement reveals more of the plaza in the foreground and a tall, matching striped bell tower in the background to the right of the cathedral. Throughout the shot, the cathedral remains the central element, though it becomes smaller within the frame as more of the surrounding environment is included. The time-lapse effect causes the clouds to drift rapidly across the frame, while people move as blurs across the expansive stone plaza. The video is a scenery shot, with the focus on the grandeur of the environment and the passage of time within it, rather than on any specific object or person. The cathedral is situated in a large, open plaza flanked by multi-story buildings, where a few pedestrians can be seen walking.",

    "Camera": "This is a time-lapse video of a cathedral, captured with a noticeable fisheye lens distortion that curves the architecture. The shot is framed from a low, eye-level angle, utilizing deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. The camera performs a slightly unsteady counterclockwise arc around the cathedral.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a wide-angle, time-lapse cityscape scenery shot centered on a magnificent cathedral square. The primary structure is an immense Gothic cathedral with an incredibly ornate facade made of white and dark-striped marble, featuring three large arched portals, numerous sculptures, and spires reaching toward the sky. A large, mirrored window sits prominently above the central entrance, and a tall, striped bell tower becomes visible as the camera arcs counterclockwise. The sky is a brilliant blue, filled with fluffy white clouds that drift rapidly across the frame, while people move as blurs across the expansive stone plaza. There is no single main subject, as the fisheye perspective and time-lapse technique are used to capture the overwhelming scale and dynamic atmosphere of the entire architectural ensemble. The focus is on the grandeur of the environment and the passage of time within it, rather than on any specific object or person.",
    "Motion": "This is a wide-angle, time-lapse video of the magnificent Siena Cathedral in Italy. The camera performs a slightly unsteady counterclockwise arc around the cathedral, revealing the full, ornate Gothic facade and the adjacent striped bell tower against a bright blue sky. The time-lapse effect causes the clouds and people in the piazza to move quickly across the frame.",
    "Scene": "A wide-angle, time-lapse shot captures the ornate facade of the Siena Cathedral in Italy under a bright blue sky with fast-moving white clouds. The Gothic cathedral is constructed from white and dark striped marble and features a highly decorated front with three large arched portals, numerous spires, and intricate sculptures. A large, plain circular glass window sits in the center, below a triangular gable adorned with a golden mosaic. As the camera arcs counterclockwise, a tall, matching striped bell tower is revealed to the side of the main structure. The cathedral is situated in a large, open plaza flanked by multi-story buildings, where a few pedestrians can be seen walking.",
    "Spatial": "This video presents a wide shot of a cathedral, captured from a low angle with a fisheye distortion. Initially, the cathedral's facade is centered in the frame, occupying the middle ground. The foreground consists of a road at the bottom of the frame, while buildings on the left and right frame the central structure. The sky occupies the background at the top of the frame. The camera then arcs counterclockwise, widening the view. This movement reveals more of the plaza in the foreground and a tall bell tower in the background to the right of the cathedral. Throughout the shot, the cathedral remains the central element, though it becomes smaller within the frame as more of the surrounding environment is included. The video is a scenery shot, with blurred people moving quickly across the plaza due to a time-lapse effect."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
