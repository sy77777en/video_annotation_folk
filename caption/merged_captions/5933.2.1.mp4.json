  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot focusing on tall, dry grass in the foreground, occupying most of the frame. The grass is centrally positioned in the 2D space and in the foreground in 3D, partially obscuring the view. The camera is at ground level, capturing a high angle view of the grass with a shallow depth of field, initially focusing on it. As the camera moves forward and tilts up, transitioning to a level angle, the focus shifts slightly to the midground, where a person’s legs and boots become visible, revealing them walking through a shallow body of water. This focus change is achieved through a rack focus. The person is wearing dark, knee-high rubber boots and light-colored pants. The boots create ripples in the water as they move, indicating the person's slow, deliberate pace. The boots appear in the lower part of the frame, near the bottom center in 2D and in the middle ground in 3D. The water extends from the middle ground into the background, reflecting the sky. In the far background, grass is visible once more. The camera maintains a level position relative to the subject, capturing the boots and the water as the primary elements. The grass continues to occupy the upper portion of the frame, gradually becoming less prominent as the boots and water become more central. The transition from the initial focus on the grass to the boots and water is smooth, emphasizing the interaction between the person and the environment. The scene captures an outdoor setting in a natural environment, likely a marsh or wetland area, with tall, dry grasses and a body of water reflecting the sky, suggesting a calm atmosphere. The camera movement is unsteady, with noticeable shaking throughout.",

    "Camera": "The video begins with the camera at ground level, capturing a high angle view of grass in the foreground. It uses a shallow depth of field, initially focusing on the grass. The camera then moves forward and tilts up, transitioning to a level angle as it shifts focus to the midground, where a person’s legs are visible. This focus change is achieved through a rack focus. The camera movement is unsteady, with noticeable shaking throughout.",
    "Subject": "The video begins with a close-up of tall, dry grass, revealing a person walking through a shallow body of water. The person is wearing dark, knee-high rubber boots and light-colored pants. The boots create ripples in the water as they move, indicating the person's slow, deliberate pace. The grass initially obscures the view, but as the scene progresses, the focus shifts to the boots and the water, highlighting the interaction between the person and the natural environment.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a close-up of tall, dry grass, with a blurred background of a body of water. As the camera moves forward and tilts up, the person's legs and boots become visible, revealing them walking through the shallow water. The person is wearing dark, knee-high rubber boots and light-colored pants. The boots create ripples in the water as they move, indicating the person's slow, deliberate pace. The background remains consistent, showing a calm, natural setting with the water reflecting the sky.",
    "Scene": "The video captures an outdoor setting in a natural environment, likely a marsh or wetland area. The scene features tall, dry grasses with a golden-brown hue, their slender, textured stalks swaying gently. In the background, a body of water reflects the sky, suggesting a calm atmosphere. The time of day appears to be daytime, with clear skies and natural light illuminating the scene. The ground is wet, with visible water puddles, indicating recent rain or a naturally damp area. The presence of boots suggests human activity, with individuals walking through the shallow water, creating ripples. The overall scene conveys a serene, untouched landscape with subtle human interaction.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a close-up shot focusing on tall, dry grass in the foreground, occupying most of the frame. The grass is centrally positioned in the 2D space and in the foreground in 3D, partially obscuring the view. As the scene progresses, the shot size remains a close-up, but the focus shifts slightly. A person wearing dark, knee-high rubber boots and light-colored pants enters the frame from the top, moving downward into the water. The boots appear in the lower part of the frame, near the bottom center in 2D and in the middle ground in 3D. The water extends from the middle ground into the background, reflecting the sky. In the far background, grass is visible once more. The camera maintains a level position relative to the subject, capturing the boots and the water as the primary elements. The grass continues to occupy the upper portion of the frame, gradually becoming less prominent as the boots and water become more central. The transition from the initial focus on the grass to the boots and water is smooth, emphasizing the interaction between the person and the environment."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
