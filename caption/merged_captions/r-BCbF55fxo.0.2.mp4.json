  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot framed from behind the top of a dark vehicle that occupies the left foreground. In the middle ground, slightly right of center, a group of police officers in lighter khaki uniforms with darker brown pants escorts a white man in a gray shirt with a black jacket toward a white and green police car. The camera, slightly unsteady and at eye level, moves left, tracking the officers as they push the man down onto the vehicle's hood. The scene is set at night, with police cars flashing blue and red lights in the middle ground, and a \"7P\" sign visible in the top right. In the background, rows of stadium-like red seats and large tents illuminated with warm lights add depth to the setting. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, initially focusing on the police activity in the middleground. It then executes a rack focus, shifting the composition to a close-up shot, bringing the back of a man with short, dark, curly hair in a tan police uniform sharply into focus in the right foreground. This man stands beside another vehicle, observing the arrest scene, which becomes a blurred element in the background with out-of-focus police lights. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the shot, capturing the dynamics of the unfolding events.",

    "Camera": "This slightly unsteady, eye-level shot moves left, tracking a group of running police officers escorting a suspect from the side. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, initially focusing on the police activity in the middleground before executing a rack focus to bring the back of a police officer's head in the foreground sharply into focus.",
    "Subject": "In the midground, a group of men in lighter khaki police uniforms on top with darker brown pants escort a white man in a gray shirt with a black jacket, pressing him against the hood of a white and green police car. The focus then shifts to the foreground, revealing the back of a man with short, dark, curly hair. This man, wearing a tan police uniform, is positioned beside a vehicle, observing the arrest taking place outside.",
    "Motion": "A group of police officers moves around a white and green police car, pushing a man down onto the vehicle's hood in the middleground. The camera's focus then shifts from this activity to the foreground, settling on the back of a man's head as he stands next to another vehicle and watches the scene unfold. The man in the foreground remains still.",
    "Scene": "The video begins with a shot from behind a damaged car at night, capturing the scene as police officers escort a man to the hood of a police vehicle. The camera follows the officers, eventually settling over the left shoulder of a police officer in the foreground, providing a view of the unfolding events. In the immediate foreground, the front of the damaged vehicle and the back of the man being escorted are clearly visible. Police cars with flashing blue and red lights are present in the middle ground, along with a sign marked \"7P\" visible in the air. In the background, rows of stadium-like red seats and large tents illuminated with warm lights can be seen, adding depth to the nighttime setting.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a wide shot framed from behind the top of a dark vehicle that occupies the left foreground. In the middle ground, slightly right of center, a group of police officers escorts a man toward a white and green police car. In the background, red stadium seats are visible on the left, and a \"7P\" sign is positioned in the top right. The camera then moves to the left while executing a rack focus, shifting the composition to a close-up shot. In this final framing, the back of a man's head and shoulders occupies the right foreground, while the arrest scene becomes a blurred element in the background, with out-of-focus police lights. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
