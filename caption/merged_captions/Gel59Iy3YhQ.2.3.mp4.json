  "merged_caption": "This wide shot presents a scene with distinct depth. The bottom of the frame is a solid black silhouette of the foreground. A small, silhouetted figure, appearing as a completely black shape with a round head and a small body, is positioned slightly to the right of center, pushing a rectangular box from left to right. The only visible features on this character are two large, bright, white, glowing circles for eyes. To the far left, another box-like object stands, marked with two white, upward-pointing arrows. A large, indistinct, spiky structure occupies the background, shrouded in fog, with thin, vine-like shapes hanging from the top of the frame. In a side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene in profile, a silhouetted landscape is presented in a monochromatic black-and-white style with a heavy vignette effect. The outdoor setting features a dark, grassy hill under a foggy, hazy sky, with beams of light cutting through the gloom. The small, silhouetted figure with glowing white eyes pushes the box steadily in a crouched position from left to right across the dark, silhouetted landscape. From a level angle, the camera smoothly tracks the small, silhouetted character from the side, moving rightward through the foggy, dark landscape, following its side-scrolling movement.",

    "Subject": "A small, silhouetted figure, appearing as a completely black shape with a round head and a small body, is positioned in the scene. The only visible features on this character are two large, bright, white, glowing circles for eyes. The figure is crouched behind a black, rectangular box. To the left of this figure is another, similar black box, distinguished by two white arrows pointing upwards on its side.",
    "Motion": "A small, silhouetted figure with glowing white eyes pushes the box steadily in a crouched position from left to right across the dark, silhouetted landscape, while the camera moves rightward to follow its motion.",
    "Scene": "In a side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene in profile, a silhouetted landscape is presented in a monochromatic black-and-white style with a heavy vignette effect. The outdoor setting features a dark, grassy hill under a foggy, hazy sky, with beams of light cutting through the gloom. In the blurry background, a large, indistinct, and spiky structure looms, while thin, vine-like shapes hang from above. The foreground is a solid black silhouette, where a small character with glowing white eyes pushes a dark, rectangular box. To the left, another box-like object stands, marked with two white, upward-pointing arrows.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
