  "merged_caption": "This is a close-up shot filmed at the subject's level, capturing a static, high-angle view from eye level. Initially, a man's right hand, adorned with a silver ring and positioned with the back facing upward, is centered in the frame, holding a white egg inside a black frying pan on a wooden table. The man's torso is visible in the middle ground, while the darkness serves as the background. On the right of the pan, a grey cardboard egg carton containing several more white eggs is placed, and on the left, a clear plastic container filled with a white granular substance sits on a folded blue cloth, with a yellow-capped spice shaker partially visible behind it. These items are in the foreground, filling the bottom half of the frame. As the hand in the center suddenly opens, the egg immediately cracks apart, with pieces of white shell and fragments of yellow yolk bursting outward. This scattering action transitions to slow motion, with the fragments splattering onto and above the frying pan. The video uses a speed ramp effect, shifting between fast and slow motion, effectively maintaining focus on the man's hands, the frying pan, and the eggs in the foreground. When the shot freezes, the goo and fragments remain suspended in the air. The man's open hand continues to hover above the broken egg in the center of the frame.",

    "Camera": "This static, high-angle shot is filmed from eye level. The video uses a speed ramp effect, shifting between fast and slow motion. A shallow depth of field effectively maintains focus on the man's hands, the frying pan, and the eggs in the foreground.",
    "Subject": "A light-skinned man, visible from the chest up and wearing a patterned t-shirt, holds a white egg inside a black frying pan on a wooden table. His right hand, adorned with a silver ring, is initially clenched with the back facing upward, hovering above the egg. In slow motion, his hand suddenly opens, causing the egg to crack apart and pieces of white shell and yellow yolk to splatter both inside and outside the pan. To the right of the pan is a grey cardboard egg carton containing several more white eggs. To the left, a clear plastic container filled with a white granular substance sits on a folded blue cloth, with a yellow-capped spice shaker partially visible behind it.",
    "Motion": "A man's right hand, adorned with a silver ring and positioned with the back facing upward, hovers above a white egg inside a frying pan. As his hand swiftly opens, captured in slow motion, the egg shatters, sending white shell fragments and yellow yolk splattering both inside the pan and onto the surrounding surface.",
    "Scene": "An indoor scene is set at a wooden table against a dark background. On the table sits a black frying pan, a cardboard carton of white eggs, a clear jar filled with a white granular substance resting on a blue cloth, and a spice shaker with a yellow cap. A person's right hand, adorned with a silver ring, is positioned above the eggs with the back of the hand facing upward. In a swift motion, the hand opens, causing a single white egg to crack open. The egg shatters in slow motion, scattering white shell fragments and yellow yolk both inside and outside the pan.",
    "Spatial": "This is a close-up shot filmed at the subject's level. Initially, a man's hand is positioned in the center of the frame, holding a white egg inside a black frying pan. The man's torso is visible in the middle ground, while the darkness serves as the background. On the right of the pan, an egg carton is placed, and on the left, a transparent jar containing a white substance sits on a piece of blue fabric, with a seasoning bottle with a yellow cap behind it. These items are in the foreground, set on a wooden table that fills the bottom half of the frame. As the hand in the center suddenly opens, the egg immediately cracks apart, with pieces of white shell and fragments of yellow yolk bursting outward. This scattering action transitions to slow motion, with the fragments splattering onto and above the frying pan. When the shot freezes, the goo and fragments remain suspended in the air. The man's open hand continues to hover above the broken egg in the center of the frame."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
