  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a low-angle full shot of a large, muscular, green-skinned humanoid figure with dark, shaggy hair, shirtless and wearing only dark, torn pants, descending from the top of the frame against a cloudy sky. The camera starts at a low, eye-level angle, tracking the figure as he jumps by moving slowly backward and tilting up. As he descends through the air with arms outstretched, he passes over some metal fencing, with a large, institutional-style building constructed from grey stone with arched windows visible in the background. The sky is completely overcast with dense, grey clouds, creating dim, diffused daylight. As the figure moves downward toward the camera, the shot transitions to a medium shot at the subject's level. The camera uses a speed ramp effect to transition smoothly between slow motion and regular speed, enhancing the dynamic movement of the scene. He lands forcefully on a manicured green lawn, coming to rest on his hands and knees in a crouched, powerful pose in the center of the frame. The camera quickly tilts down and pans left, transitioning to a level, ground-level perspective to continue following him. The entire scene is captured with a deep focus, keeping all elements sharp, with the large stone building positioned in the background.",

    "Subject": "A large, muscular, green-skinned humanoid figure with dark, shaggy hair is depicted. He is shirtless, wearing only a pair of dark, torn pants, and is barefoot. The figure is shown in mid-air with his arms outstretched, and then lands on a grassy area on his hands and knees in a crouched, powerful pose.",
    "Motion": "A large, green figure descends through the air with arms outstretched. He lands forcefully on a grassy lawn, coming to rest on his hands and knees in a crouched position.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set outdoors on a manicured green lawn in front of a large, institutional-style building constructed from grey stone with arched windows. The sky is completely overcast with dense, grey clouds, creating dim, diffused daylight. A large, green-skinned figure descends from the sky, passing over some metal fencing before landing forcefully on the grass in a crouched position.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a low-angle full shot of a green figure in the center of the frame, descending from the top against a cloudy sky, with metal fencing in the background. As the figure moves downward toward the camera, the shot transitions to a medium shot at the subject's level. He lands in the center of the frame, crouched in the foreground on a grassy lawn, with a large stone building positioned in the background."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
