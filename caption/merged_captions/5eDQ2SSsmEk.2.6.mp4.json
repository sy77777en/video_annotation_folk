  "merged_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of a man with a medium skin tone, short dark hair, and facial stubble, seated inside a vehicle. He is wearing a dark jacket over a collared shirt and occupies the left side of the frame, positioned in the foreground, while the vehicle's interior elements such as the steering wheel and dashboard are situated towards the right, also in the foreground. The man's face and upper body are visible, with his left hand holding a takeout container and his right hand using chopsticks to eat food from it. The camera begins at eye level, focused on the man eating in a car, using a shallow depth of field to concentrate on the midground. Initially, the camera is at a level angle, looking straight ahead. The man continues to eat, occasionally lifting the chopsticks to his mouth. The interior of the vehicle is dimly lit, with the window beside him streaked with raindrops, suggesting a rainy setting outside. The rain-streaked window is in the background, occupying the upper right portion of the frame, contributing to the dimly lit ambiance. The coiled cord hangs near the window, slightly to the right. The camera then transitions to a low angle as it zooms out and tilts up, with the movement slightly unsteady and some shaking. The man pauses, holding the chopsticks in the air, and looks to his right. The vehicle's dashboard and steering wheel are visible, with a coiled cord hanging nearby, adding to the confined, personal atmosphere. The overall color palette is muted, with dark tones and subtle highlights from the exterior lights filtering through the rain-streaked glass, creating a moody, contemplative ambiance. There are no significant changes in shot size or camera height; the focus remains consistently on the man and his actions within the confined space of the car.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
