  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot, a young, light-skinned woman with long, dark brown hair stands in the center of the frame and in the foreground, wearing a yellow, floral-print top with short, puffy sleeves. She holds a silver-colored pneumatic tool in her right hand, located in the lower center of the frame, and a gold-colored balloon in her left hand, located in the center-right. The scene takes place outdoors during the day, with a chain-link fence visible in the middle ground directly behind her, and dense green trees filling the background. The video is filmed with a speed ramp effect, beginning in slow motion, transitioning to an even slower motion, and then reverting to slow motion at the end. The camera is positioned at a smooth, eye-level height and maintains a level angle, performing a minor, smooth pan from right to left. A shallow depth of field is used to keep the focus on the woman in the foreground. The woman stands mostly still, subtly moving her right arm to position the pneumatic tool closer to the inflated gold balloon in her other hand. This movement causes the balloon to pop, releasing a fine mist of water that erupts from its position, expanding outward primarily towards the right side of the frame. The balloon, initially intact, pops in slow motion, and a spray of water erupts, creating a mist of fine droplets in the air. The camera remains stationary and at the woman's level throughout the shot, capturing the dynamic change as the balloon bursts and the water disperses.",

    "Subject": "A young, light-skinned woman with long, dark brown hair stands facing forward with a neutral expression. She wears a yellow, floral-print top with short, puffy sleeves. In her left hand, she holds a gold-colored balloon, which is initially inflated and then pops, spraying water. In her right hand, she holds a silver-colored pneumatic tool, its nozzle pressed against the balloon.",
    "Motion": "A woman stands mostly still, subtly moving her right arm to position a pneumatic tool closer to an inflated gold balloon in her other hand. This movement causes the balloon to pop, releasing a fine mist of water.",
    "Scene": "The scene takes place outdoors during the day, with a chain-link fence positioned in front of a background of dense green trees. In the foreground, a woman in a yellow floral top holds a gold-colored balloon and a silver air tool. The balloon, initially inflated, is popped, causing a spray of water to erupt in slow motion, creating a mist of fine droplets in the air.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
