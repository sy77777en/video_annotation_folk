  "merged_caption": "This is a close-up shot from ground level and at a level angle, focusing on a person's lower legs and feet, which are positioned in the center middle ground on a patch of manicured green grass. The person is wearing light-colored, loose-fitting trousers and dark blue suede sneakers with white laces and a brown gum sole. A yellow golf ball rolls into the frame from the bottom left and settles in the foreground, left of center. Following this, a silver golf club head enters from the left and positions itself in the foreground, to the left and behind the ball. The person's right foot moves one step forward and then steps back. The camera, positioned at ground level, focuses on the person's shoes in the midground with a shallow depth of field, while the slightly unsteady camera tilts down, bringing a blurred golf ball and club into the foreground. The background is softly blurred, showing trees and foliage under daylight conditions. To the top left, a portion of a red and black object, consistent with a golf bag, is partially visible.",

    "Camera": "The camera, positioned at ground level, focuses on a person's shoes in the midground with a shallow depth of field, while the slightly unsteady camera tilts down, bringing a blurred golf ball and club into the foreground.",
    "Subject": "A person, seen from ground level with a straight angle, showing their lower legs and feet, standing on a patch of green grass. They are wearing light-colored, loose-fitting trousers and dark blue suede sneakers with a white stripe on the side, white laces, and a brown gum sole. The silver golf club and the yellow golf ball enter from the left. The silver-colored iron golf club positions the yellow golf ball in front of the person's feet, then positions itself behind the ball, poised to be swung.",
    "Motion": "From ground level and at a level angle, a yellow golf ball rolls into the frame from the left and stops on the grass. A silver golf club is then lowered into view and placed on the ground to the left and behind the ball, while the person's feet make slight forward movements and stop.",
    "Scene": "From a ground-level perspective on a manicured green lawn, a person stands wearing light-colored trousers and dark blue suede sneakers with white laces and a brown gum sole. In the middle ground, the person's feet are positioned standing. A yellow golf ball rests on the grass in the foreground, with the head of a silver metal golf club positioned to the left and behind it. The background is softly blurred, showing trees and foliage under daylight conditions. To the top left, a portion of a red and black object, consistent with a golf bag, is partially visible.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
