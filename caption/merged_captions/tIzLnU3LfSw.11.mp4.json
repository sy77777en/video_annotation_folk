  "merged_caption": "This shot begins with five male ice hockey players celebrating in a group in the middle ground, initially positioned on the center-right of the frame near the rink boards. The players wear matching uniforms consisting of dark blue helmets with visors, jerseys that are white at the top of the shoulders and dark blue on the sides, with the chest area also being dark blue. The jerseys feature red at the bottom, which refers to their hockey pants extending from the waist to the top of the knee. The players also wear long socks on their shins that match the red, white, and blue color scheme. Their gloves are a combination of red, white, and blue. White numbers, including 27, 9, 4, 25, and 28, are visible on their sleeves and backs. Initially, it is a medium full shot, with the players visible from the middle of the shin and upwards. Spectators are visible in the background behind a glass barrier, including a woman with blonde hair wearing a white vest and a person in a grey sweatshirt with the word \"PENGUINS\" on the front. The players, holding hockey sticks, initially gather in a celebratory huddle against the boards, patting each other on the back and head. They then break from the huddle and skate together as a group across the ice, moving away from the boards and toward the center of the rink. As they skate in a loose formation towards the right, the camera, from a high, overhead angle, captures the scene with a deep focus, keeping the entire ice rink and the players in focus. The camera pans to follow their movement, keeping them relatively centered, and zooms out to create a full shot. They pass a red-framed goal net on the left and continue across the ice. The rink boards and advertisements, including a \"mccann\" logo in green and blue text on a white background and a large \"Jeep\" logo next to a graphic of a red vehicle, occupy the background upper part of the frame, while the spectators remain in the background throughout the shot.",

    "Camera": "From a high, overhead angle, the camera captures the scene with a deep focus, keeping the entire ice rink and the players in focus. Initially stationary, the camera then performs a smooth pan to the right, combined with a slight zoom out, to track a group of hockey players as they skate across the ice.",

    "Scene": "An indoor ice hockey rink features a group of players skating on a white ice surface. The rink is enclosed by white boards marked with blue and red lines and various advertisements, including a \"mccann\" logo in green and blue text on a white background and a large \"Jeep\" logo next to a graphic of a red vehicle. In the background, spectators watch the scene from tiered seating behind a clear glass barrier. The players, wearing dark blue, white, and red uniforms with matching helmets, celebrate together near the boards before skating away as a group towards the center of the rink, passing in front of a red-framed goal net.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
