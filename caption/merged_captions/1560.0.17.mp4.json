  "merged_caption": "The video presents a wide shot capturing a young man with light skin and short hair, wearing a brown jacket over a light-colored shirt, blue jeans, brown shoes, and dark gloves, walking through a snowy park. He carries a black backpack with both straps and holds a camera in his right hand. Initially, the man is positioned in the midground, slightly off-center to the left, moving towards the right side of the frame. As he progresses, the camera, positioned at eye level with a level angle, moves forward smoothly while panning right to keep him prominently positioned within the frame, ensuring steady and fluid motion. The camera continuously moves closer to the subject, making him appear larger in the frame, yet the overall shot remains a wide shot, maintaining a stable spatial composition focused on the man's movement across the snowy path. The foreground includes a small section of hedges on the left, which move out of the frame as the camera shifts. The row of hedges and leafless trees lining the path extends from the midground to the background. Two individuals dressed in dark clothing are seated on a bench located in the middle ground, positioned towards the right side of the frame, appearing to look at the ground. The background features light brown multi-story buildings with numerous arched doorways on the ground floor, spanning the width of the scene. The setting is serene, with snow covering the ground and the branches of the trees, and the sky is overcast in daytime, with diffused lighting creating a soft, muted atmosphere. The man continues to walk steadily, passing by the hedge and trees, while the two people on the bench remain seated, seemingly engaged in conversation or quiet activities.",

    "Motion": "A man in a brown jacket and blue jeans is walking forward through a snowy park, remaining on the left side of the frame throughout the video. The background features a large building with arched windows and a courtyard, surrounded by snow-covered trees and bushes. The man continues to walk steadily, passing by the hedge and trees. The two people on the bench remain seated, seemingly engaged in conversation or quiet activities.",
    "Scene": "The video captures an outdoor winter scene in a park-like setting, featuring snow-covered ground and bare trees with a light dusting of snow on their branches. The environment includes a row of hedges and light brown multi-story buildings in the background, with numerous arched doorways on the ground floor. The sky is overcast in daytime, with diffused lighting creating a soft, muted atmosphere. A few benches are placed along a path, and the snow adds a uniform white layer across the landscape. The scene is calm, with minimal movement, as one individual walks along the path, dressed in winter clothing.",
    "Spatial": "The video presents a wide shot capturing a young man walking through a snowy park. Initially, the man is positioned in the midground, slightly off-center to the left, moving towards the right side of the frame. As he progresses, the camera moves as well, keeping him on the right side and bringing him into the foreground. At the start, the foreground includes a small section of hedges on the left, which move out of the frame as the camera shifts. The row of hedges and leafless trees lining the path extends from the midground to the background. Two individuals dressed in dark clothing are seated on a bench located in the middle ground, positioned towards the right side of the frame. The buildings with arched doorways are situated in the background, spanning the width of the scene. The camera continuously moves closer to the subject, making him appear larger in the frame, yet the overall shot remains a wide shot, maintaining a stable spatial composition focused on the man's movement across the snowy path."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
