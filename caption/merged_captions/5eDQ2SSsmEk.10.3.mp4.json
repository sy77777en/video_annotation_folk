  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a medium full shot of a man in a dark leather jacket, positioned in the center-left of the frame and in the middle ground. He is seen from the back in a dimly lit, dark environment, mostly in shadow, making his other features not discernible. To his right, a simple, wall-mounted sink with tarnished faucets is visible in the foreground, while a graffiti-covered wall is on the far left in the middle ground. The scene is set within a dark, grimy, and confined indoor space, resembling a dilapidated public restroom. A single, cool-toned light source from an overhead vent casts harsh shadows, illuminating dirty walls covered in dark graffiti. In the background, the word \"RELAX\" is painted in black letters on the top-center wall. The man walks away from the camera and towards the background, entering a narrow, dark bathroom stall on the left. As he does so, the video transitions to a full shot. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. From a hip-level perspective with a fixed Dutch angle, the camera moves smoothly and slowly, centering the zoom on the middle of the frame as the man enters the bathroom stall. The space is divided by dark partitions, enhancing the confined feel of the environment.",

    "Subject": "A man, seen from the back, is shown in a dimly lit, dark environment. He is wearing a dark leather jacket. His figure is mostly in shadow as he walks away from the viewer and into a narrow, dark bathroom stall. Due to the low lighting and the camera angle, his other features are not discernible.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
