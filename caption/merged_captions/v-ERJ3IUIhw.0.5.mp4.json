  "merged_caption": "A blue-lined circle, divided into segments, initially occupies the center against a white background. Within this circle, a smaller concentric circle and a central flower-like pattern materialize, followed by additional concentric circles and smaller peripheral circles, all remaining in the center. The entire circular design then shrinks and shifts slightly upwards, while lines extend downwards from its sides, forming the top edges of two rectangular structures that appear at the bottom left and bottom right. This stop-motion animation is created frame by frame, showcasing a unique and creative storytelling technique. The video begins with a stylized spiral shape drawn in blue lines, which gradually transforms into a circular wheel. From this wheel, a flower and concentric circles emerge outward, connecting to additional circles. These elements then shrink into a building logo. The transition continues seamlessly into a sketch of a building facade, featuring a symmetrical design with multiple windows and a prominent circular feature at the top center. Finally, the shrinking circular design resolves into a detailed circular window or logo at the top center of a building facade sketch, which now fills the frame, viewed from a low angle looking upwards. The building features multiple symmetrical rectangular windows on both sides, aligned in height. The video presents a minimalist, animated scene with a clean, white background. Initially, a dynamic, abstract form resembling a spiral or shell unfolds, characterized by smooth, flowing lines and a monochromatic blue hue. This shape suggests movement and transformation, with a sense of fluidity and elegance. As the scene progresses, the abstract form transforms into a circular pattern similar to a clock, gradually reducing in size to become a central feature of a stylized architectural structure. The overall aesthetic is clean and geometric, emphasizing simplicity and symmetry in design.",

    "Subject": "The video begins with a stylized, spiral shape resembling a shell or fan, drawn in blue lines. This shape gradually transforms into a circular wheel, from which a flower and concentric circles emerge outward. These elements connect to additional circles, eventually shrinking into a building logo. This seamless transition leads to a sketch of a building facade, characterized by a symmetrical design with multiple windows and a prominent circular feature at the top center, resembling a stained glass window or decorative element. The building is depicted with simple, clean lines, maintaining the blue color scheme, and the overall style is minimalist and architectural.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
