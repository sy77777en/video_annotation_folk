  "merged_caption": "This video uses a medium close-up shot, focusing on a man with a deep brown skin tone, wearing a dark jacket with bold white text 'JE SUIS' and 'VEN' and a light-colored shirt underneath, positioned in the center foreground. He has a closely shaved head and a slight mustache, and he is looking directly at the camera with a neutral expression. The static camera is positioned at a low angle, looking up, employing a shallow depth of field that keeps the man in focus while the background remains blurred. The man raises his right hand and gestures in the direction of the camera while speaking, moving his hand closer to the camera and maintaining his gesturing motion. He then lowers his hand slightly but continues to look at the camera. Behind and above him, a group of silhouetted figures occupies the top center background, standing on an elevated platform or bridge, silhouetted against the overcast sky, suggesting a cool or transitional season. Bare tree branches are visible in the top left background, contributing to the outdoor urban setting. The individuals in the group are not clearly distinguishable due to the lighting and distance, and they are dressed in casual attire. The scene is captured from a low angle, emphasizing the height of the platform and the people silhouetted against the sky. The man leans slightly forward and gestures near his face during the shot, while the background shows a consistent scene of the group standing above, silhouetted against the sky, conveying a sense of urban architecture.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
