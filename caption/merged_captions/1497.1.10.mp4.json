  "merged_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of a light-skinned man with short, dark, wavy hair combed back from his forehead, wearing a dark-colored suit jacket. Initially positioned in the center foreground with his left profile visible, his left side faces the camera, and his gaze is directed off-screen to the left. The setting is ambiguous, with a dark, possibly deep green, backdrop that could be a curtain or wall. A piece of furniture with a pattern of dark green and light green fabric is partially visible in the middle ground to the right. A \"MOVIECLIPS.COM\" watermark is overlaid in the bottom left corner. The camera is positioned at the subject's eye level and maintains a level angle, using a shallow depth of field to keep the man in focus. As the video progresses, the camera exhibits minor, very smooth movement as it pans from right to left, following the man. Concurrently, the man turns his upper body to his right, away from the camera, causing his right shoulder and back to become more prominent in the frame. His head remains relatively central, turning to show more of its rear aspects. Throughout the shot, his lips remain closed.",

    "Subject": "A light-skinned man is shown in a close-up profile view, facing towards the left. He has short, dark, wavy hair combed back from his forehead. He wears a dark-colored suit jacket, with his left side initially facing the camera. As the video progresses, his body gradually shifts, and his right shoulder and back turn towards the viewer. His lips remain closed, and his gaze is directed off-screen to the left.",
    "Motion": "The man, initially shown in a left profile view, turns his upper body to his right, away from the camera, so that his right shoulder and back become more prominent in the frame.",
    "Scene": "The setting is ambiguous, with a dark, possibly deep green, backdrop that could be a curtain or wall. In the background, a piece of furniture with a pattern of dark green and light green fabric is partially visible. A \"MOVIECLIPS.COM\" watermark is present as an overlay in the bottom left corner.",
    "Spatial": "The video presents a close-up shot of a man, initially positioned in the center foreground with his left profile visible. A piece of patterned furniture is partially visible in the middle ground to the right, and a \"MOVIECLIPS.COM\" watermark is overlaid in the bottom left corner. Throughout the shot, the man rotates his upper body, causing his right shoulder and back to turn towards the viewer and occupy the center foreground, while his head, remaining relatively central, turns to show more of its rear aspects. The camera is positioned at the subject's level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
