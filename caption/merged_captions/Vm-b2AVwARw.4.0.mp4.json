  "merged_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide, high-angle shot of a futuristic cityscape at night. The camera, from a high, aerial perspective, smoothly arcs counterclockwise around a tall, curvilinear skyscraper, gradually moving closer to it. This skyscraper, positioned in the foreground as the scene's primary focus, features a dark facade adorned with a grid of glowing white, three-pointed star patterns, while its sides are illuminated by bright vertical cyan lights. The shot uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the building in sharp focus. Surrounding this central tower, the dark silhouettes of other buildings are visible in the background, filling the left, right, and bottom portions of the frame. A network of glowing white lines, representing roads or a digital network, is situated in the middle ground and background, weaving between the structures. The surrounding city is dark, with these glowing lines tracing paths like roads or energy grids around other silhouetted buildings, creating a dark, sleek, and technologically advanced atmosphere. An overlay in the top right corner displays the text, \"Animations are for illustrative purposes only. The final build...\" The camera maintains its high-angle perspective looking down on the city, capturing the futuristic, stylized cityscape as it moves in an arc towards the skyscraper, emphasizing the dynamic and advanced environment.",

    "Subject": "This video showcases a futuristic cityscape at night, with a focus on a towering, curvilinear skyscraper as the central subject. The skyscraper's dark facade is adorned with a repeating pattern of glowing white, three-pointed star-like shapes. Bright, cyan light traces the vertical edges of this central building, making it stand out against the dark surroundings. The rest of the city features silhouetted skyscrapers and smaller structures, all interconnected by a glowing white network of concentric and intersecting lines that suggest advanced roadways or energy grids, creating a dark, sleek, and technologically advanced atmosphere.",
    "Motion": "This is a nighttime, high-angle shot of a futuristic, stylized cityscape. The central focus is a tall, sleek skyscraper with a curved design, illuminated by bright blue lights along its edges and a pattern of glowing white triangles on its facade. The surrounding city is dark, with glowing white lines tracing paths like roads or a digital network around other silhouetted buildings.",
    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures a futuristic cityscape at night, centered on a tall, curvilinear skyscraper. The building's dark facade is covered in a grid of glowing white, three-pointed star patterns, while its sides are illuminated by bright vertical cyan lights. Surrounding the central tower are the dark silhouettes of other buildings and a network of glowing white lines that form roads in concentric circles.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
