  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot from behind a woman with shoulder-length brown hair, featuring lighter highlights and bangs, positioned in the center of the frame. She is wearing a striped shirt and large, black over-ear headphones with the \"Sennheiser\" brand name visible on the left earcup, which also has a letter \"R\" on it. Her expression is focused and serious as she looks forward, seemingly concentrating on something off-screen. The scene is set in a dimly lit room with cool-toned lighting. In the background, a dark shelving unit filled with what appear to be CD or DVD cases is visible, with a piece of audio equipment with a small, illuminated blue screen in the background to the left of the woman. Positioned at an eye-level, level angle, the camera uses a shallow depth of field to focus on the woman in the foreground. The camera slowly arcs clockwise around her, capturing her profile while keeping her centered in the frame. Her head remains motionless, and she only occasionally blinks, her gaze intently focused on something beyond the frame. As the camera moves, a framed picture with a light, abstract image on the neutral-colored wall enters the frame in the right background. The shot remains a close-up at the subject's level throughout the arc, smoothly transitioning to a view of her left profile.",

    "Scene": "The scene is set in a dimly lit room with cool-toned lighting. A woman with shoulder-length brown hair is seen wearing a pair of black over-ear headphones. The camera smoothly arcs clockwise gradually revealing her profile. In the background, a dark shelving unit is densely packed with what appear to be CD or DVD cases. To the left, a piece of audio equipment with a small, illuminated blue screen is visible. As the camera moves, a framed picture with a light, abstract image becomes visible on the neutral-colored wall behind her.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
