  "merged_caption": "The video features a wide shot of a dark-colored rally car, either black or dark blue, speeding along a dirt road. Initially, the car is positioned slightly off-center to the right, occupying the middle ground, with a large cloud of dust trailing behind it. The car maintains a low, sleek profile, emphasizing its speed and agility, and is adorned with visible racing decals and a spoiler. The surrounding landscape consists of sparse vegetation and distant hills, forming the background, while the dusty road occupies the foreground. The camera, a drone at an overhead level, captures the car from a high angle, maintaining a deep focus with a large depth of field. It moves forward and downward, tracking the car from above and behind, with smooth rolling motions to enhance the dynamic feel. The camera angle includes a varying Dutch angle due to rolling, and the car becomes larger in the frame as it is tracked. As the car progresses, it appears to be preparing to drift as it approaches a bend, with the dust cloud becoming more prominent. The road curves gently, and the car continues along this path, with the dust cloud growing larger as it moves further into the frame. The shot size and camera height remain constant, emphasizing the car's trajectory and the expansive desert environment. The overall spatial framing highlights the car's central role and the vastness of the surrounding terrain, with only small shifts in position throughout. The scene captures the essence of a high-energy rally race in a desert-like environment, with the arid landscape and distant rolling hills emphasizing the car's motion and the dust trail it leaves.",

    "Subject": "The video features a dark-colored rally car, either black or dark blue, driving at high speed on a dirt road, creating a large cloud of dust and smoke behind it. The car is sleek and aerodynamic, with visible racing decals and a spoiler. It navigates a winding path, suggesting dynamic movement and precision driving. The surrounding landscape is arid, with sparse vegetation and distant hills, emphasizing the car's motion and the dust trail it leaves. The scene captures the essence of a high-energy rally race in a desert-like environment.",
    "Motion": "A rally car is seen driving at high speed on a straight dirt road, producing a significant amount of dust and smoke that trails behind it. The car maintains a low, sleek profile, emphasizing its speed and agility. The background consists of a dry, arid landscape with sparse vegetation and distant hills, indicating a desert-like environment. As the car progresses, it appears to be preparing to drift as it approaches a bend, with the dust cloud becoming more prominent.",
    "Scene": "The video, captured from an overhead perspective, presents a view of a desert landscape with a primarily straight road that becomes winding towards the end. The setting is outdoors, featuring a dry, arid environment with sparse vegetation and distant rolling hills. The time of day appears to be daylight, with clear visibility and no significant weather conditions affecting the scene. A vehicle is prominently visible, moving along the road and leaving a trail of white smoke or dust behind it, creating dynamic motion across the barren terrain. The road is bordered by sandy, textured ground, emphasizing the vastness and openness of the desert setting.",
    "Spatial": "The video features a wide shot of a rally car speeding along a dirt road. Initially, the car is positioned slightly off-center to the right, occupying the middle ground, with a large cloud of dust trailing behind it. There are minor shifts in the positioning of the car throughout. As the car progresses, the camera follows its movement, maintaining a consistent overhead angle. The surrounding landscape, consisting of sparse vegetation and distant hills, forms the background, while the dusty road occupies the foreground. The camera remains above the car throughout, capturing its dynamic motion and the expanding dust trail. The shot size and camera height remain constant, emphasizing the car's trajectory and the expansive desert environment. The road curves gently, and the car continues along this path, with the dust cloud growing larger as it moves further into the frame. The overall spatial framing highlights the car's central role and the vastness of the surrounding terrain, with only small shifts in position throughout."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
