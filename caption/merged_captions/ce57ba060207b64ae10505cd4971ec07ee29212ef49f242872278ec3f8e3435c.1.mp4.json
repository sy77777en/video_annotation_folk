  "merged_caption": "This is a medium shot where the main subject, a young man with short, curly dark hair, is positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, sitting on a mustard-yellow, textured fabric sofa while reading a book. He wears a grey tie-dye t-shirt with a single red horizontal stripe across the chest and black pants. The video is in slow motion with the camera at eye level, looking straight ahead, using a shallow depth of field to focus on the person reading in the midground. The camera moves slowly from right to left with slight shakiness. In the right foreground, the back and side of another man with black dreadlocks partially frame the shot as he also reads a book, wearing a black ribbed high-neck shirt. Both men occasionally use their right hands to turn the pages. In the left background, two women are seated at a small, round table with a black top and thin metal legs. The woman on the left, seen from the back, has long dark hair and wears a white shirt, while the woman to her right, with wavy, reddish-blonde hair, is dressed in a beige shirt and dark pants. She is seen in profile, holding a pen in her right hand and gesturing with it, as if she is speaking, while the other woman remains still. They are seated on pink, upholstered chairs with slender, gold-colored legs. The scene is set within a brightly lit, modern indoor space during the daytime, with white walls, a light gray floor, and large windows in the background that illuminate the area with natural light. A light-colored, patterned rug is partially visible on the floor between the sofa and the table. The composition remains static throughout the clip, with no changes in framing or subject position.",

    "Camera": "The video is in slow motion with the camera at eye level, looking straight ahead. It uses a shallow depth of field, focusing on the person reading in the midground. The camera moves slowly from right to left with slight shakiness.",
    "Subject": "The main subject of the video is a young man with short, curly dark hair, who is sitting on a yellow couch. He wears a grey tie-dye t-shirt with a single red horizontal stripe across the chest and black pants. He is looking down intently, reading a book that he holds open with both hands. In the immediate foreground, the back and side of a dark-skinned man with black dreadlocks are visible; he is wearing a black ribbed high-neck shirt and is also holding an open book. In the background, two women are seated at a small table. The woman on the left, seen from the back, has long dark hair and wears a white shirt. The woman to her right has wavy, reddish-blonde hair and is dressed in a beige shirt and dark pants; she is seen in profile, holding a pen in her right hand and gesturing with it, as if she is speaking.",
    "Motion": "A young man sits still on a yellow couch, his head lowered as he reads a book held open in his hands, occasionally using his right hand to turn the pages. In the foreground, another man with dreadlocks is also stationary while holding a book, similarly using his right hand to turn the pages. In the background, two women are seated at a table; one with reddish-blonde hair gestures subtly with a pen, while the other woman remains still. The scene is largely static, with minimal movement from the subjects.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set within a brightly lit, modern indoor space during the daytime. The room has white walls, a light gray floor, and large windows in the background that illuminate the area with natural light. In the midground, a man is seated on a mustard-yellow, textured fabric sofa, reading a book. In the foreground, another man is also reading a book, though it is unclear what he is sitting on. Further back, two women are at a small, round table with a black top and thin metal legs. They are seated on pink, upholstered chairs that have slender, gold-colored legs. A light-colored, patterned rug is partially visible on the floor between the sofa and the table.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
