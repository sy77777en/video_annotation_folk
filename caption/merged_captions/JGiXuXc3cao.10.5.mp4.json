  "merged_caption": "The video shows a top-down view of a digital map display, featuring a white grid over a dark, textured background. A large, irregular area is outlined by a glowing, dashed red line that occupies the top, left, and right parts of the frame. A small, white, conical icon is positioned in the center-right. A solid, glowing red line is dynamically drawn, tracing a search pattern; it starts as a horizontal line near the icon, extends left, makes a sharp U-turn, and then draws subsequent parallel lines, creating a systematic back-and-forth search pattern within the larger, red-dashed boundary. As the line moves, the latitude and longitude coordinates displayed on the screen update in real-time, with \"LONG\" values around 49.95 and \"LAT\" values initially at 41.38, followed by an update to 41.4. Text boxes at the top-center display longitude and on the right side display latitude, with their numerical values changing throughout the clip. A circular compass icon remains fixed in the bottom-left corner. The very smooth camera steadily cranes upward, progressively unveiling more of the digital navigation interface.",

    "Subject": "A digital map display features a dark, textured background overlaid with a white grid. A large, irregular area is outlined by a glowing, dashed red line. Within this boundary, a solid, glowing red line traces a path, starting horizontally, making a U-turn, and then proceeding in a parallel line to create a back-and-forth search pattern. This path is associated with a small, white, conical icon. White text boxes on the screen display changing latitude and longitude coordinates. In the bottom-left corner, a white circular icon contains a compass-like symbol.",
    "Motion": "A solid red line moves across a digital map, tracing a path while a stationary white conical icon remains in the scene. The line travels horizontally to the left, makes a sharp U-turn, and then proceeds horizontally to the right on a parallel path. It then makes another U-turn and continues moving left, creating a systematic back-and-forth search pattern within a larger, red-dashed boundary. As the line moves, the latitude and longitude coordinates displayed on the screen update in real-time.",
    "Scene": "A digital display shows a map with a dark, textured background overlaid with a white grid. A large, irregular area is outlined by a glowing red dashed line. Inside this area, a white conical icon is positioned. A solid red glowing line traces a path, starting horizontally and then making several right-angle turns, creating a search pattern. Overlays on the screen include text boxes displaying changing coordinates, with \"LONG\" values around 49.95 and \"LAT\" values initially at 41.38, followed by an update to 41.4. In the bottom-left corner, a circular icon contains a compass-like symbol.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
