  "merged_caption": "The video is a wide shot capturing a serene street scene in a small town, with traditional wooden buildings featuring tiled roofs lining both sides of the street, positioned in the middle ground and background, creating a harmonious architectural setting. The camera is at eye level and maintains a level angle, moving forward along the side of the street, oriented toward the front left. On the left, a black car is moving away in the foreground, while a red car is visible further down the road in the middle ground. A group of people walks along the sidewalk on the right, positioned in the foreground and middle ground, adding movement to the scene. The street itself runs from the bottom to the top of the frame, with a white line marking the pedestrian path on the right. In the background, distant mountains provide a scenic backdrop, enhancing the sense of scale. The camera, offering a first-person perspective of the tranquil environment, shifts slightly left while panning right to avoid an electric pole, with handheld movement that is slightly unsteady and includes some shaking. The atmosphere is calm and scenic, with a clear blue sky and scattered clouds suggesting pleasant weather. The focus is on the overall ambiance and charm of the town rather than any specific object, highlighting the peaceful coexistence of nature and urban life. The street is clean and well-maintained, contributing to the picturesque scene.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
