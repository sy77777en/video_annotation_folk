  "merged_caption": "This is a wide, eye-level scenery shot capturing a walk down a narrow street in a Japanese neighborhood. Initially, a traditional Japanese building with a dark, gridded wooden facade occupies the center-left side of the frame in the middle ground. A narrow paved street is positioned on the left, leading into the background. Other houses and fences line the left side of the street in the middle ground, with a red and white communications tower visible in the distant background. A silver car is partially visible under a carport in the right middle ground. The camera moves forward with a slightly unsteady motion, centering on a traditional building with a distinctive wall of dark tiles and wood as the primary subject. The camera then pans to the left after the first second, shifting the composition so that the narrow street becomes the central focus, leading the view deeper into the neighborhood. As a result of the pan, the building on the left shifts to the right, and the houses on the left become more prominent. The camera proceeds forward once more along the path on a bright, sunny day. The scene captures a quiet residential street lined with traditional Japanese houses, featuring distinct architectural elements such as wooden facades and tiled roofs, contributing to the cultural atmosphere. The street is flanked by neatly trimmed greenery, adding a touch of nature to the urban setting. Overhead, a network of power lines crisscrosses the sky, emphasizing the blend of modern infrastructure with traditional aesthetics. A clear blue sky is crisscrossed by numerous utility wires, and a red and white communications tower is visible in the distance, highlighting the harmonious coexistence of architecture and nature rather than any specific object.",

    "Camera": "This is an eye-level, point-of-view shot capturing a walk down a narrow street in a Japanese neighborhood. The camera moves forward with a slightly unsteady motion, briefly panning left after the first second to face down the road. A deep focus keeps the entire scene, from the traditional wooden building on the right to the houses in the distance, sharp and clear.",
    "Subject": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing a quiet residential street lined with traditional Japanese houses. The buildings feature distinct architectural elements, such as wooden facades and tiled roofs, which contribute to the cultural atmosphere. The street is narrow and flanked by neatly trimmed greenery, adding a touch of nature to the urban setting. Overhead, a network of power lines crisscrosses the sky, emphasizing the blend of modern infrastructure with traditional aesthetics. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere, highlighting the harmonious coexistence of architecture and nature rather than any specific object.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a slight forward movement, centering on a traditional building with a distinctive wall of dark tiles and wood as the primary subject. The camera then pans to the left, revealing more of the narrow residential street and surrounding houses, before progressing forward again along a pathway on a sunny day in Japan.",
    "Scene": "The camera initially advances slightly, centering on a traditional two-story building with a white upper section and a distinctive lower wall composed of weathered, dark brown wooden panels arranged in a grid pattern. It then pans slowly to the left along a quiet residential street in Japan on a bright, sunny day. The narrow paved road is bordered by other houses with tiled roofs, manicured trees, and low fences. Overhead, a clear blue sky is crisscrossed by numerous utility wires, and a red and white communications tower is visible in the distance. A silver car is partially parked under a carport to the right. The camera then proceeds forward once more along the path.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
