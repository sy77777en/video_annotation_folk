  "merged_caption": "From a first-person perspective at a slightly elevated height, a gun occupies the bottom center foreground, initially aimed toward the center of the scene before moving to point toward the left. The view shifts slightly to the left, then moves forward and continues to the left over uneven, rocky ground. As the character moves, the weapon is retracted, causing the rifle, originally pointing to the bottom right of the center, to shift to the bottom left, pointing to the left side. A blue minimap is positioned in the bottom left corner, while a blue ammunition counter is in the bottom right, both as overlays. A large tree branch extends from the top right into the foreground. In the middle ground, two white cars are situated slightly right of center near a dirt road that crosses from the right middle ground to the center background. Additional trees and simple structures are scattered throughout the middle ground and background, with orange, diamond-shaped markers overlaid in the center on distant objects. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp, and first trucks slightly to the left and then moves forward. The environment contains several green, leafy trees and bushes scattered across the brown, uneven terrain. In the midground, a white sedan and another white car are parked near some simple, blocky structures. A digital heads-up display is overlaid on the view, featuring a blue minimap in the lower-left corner, a blue ammunition counter in the lower-right, and orange, diamond-shaped objective markers in the center. A black car moves to the background as the perspective shifts. The scene is sunlit and arid, with a dirt road running through the midground, where several vehicles are situated, including two white cars.",

    "Camera": "This first-person perspective video is filmed from a smooth, eye-level, and level angle. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera first trucks slightly to the left and then moves forward.",
    "Subject": "This video presents a first-person perspective from a video game, looking out over a sunny landscape with clouds. In the foreground, a black assault rifle with a scope is initially pointed towards the center of the scene, but later shifts to point towards the left. The environment contains several green, leafy trees and bushes scattered across the brown, uneven terrain. In the midground, a white sedan and another white car are parked near some simple, blocky structures. A digital heads-up display is overlaid on the view, featuring a blue minimap in the lower-left corner, a blue ammunition counter in the lower-right, and orange, diamond-shaped objective markers in the center.",

    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, looks out over a sunlit, arid outdoor area from a slightly elevated position. The metallic form of a weapon is held in the foreground. A dirt road runs through the midground, where several vehicles are situated, including two white cars. The landscape is dotted with sparse green and brown trees and low, simple structures in the distance. The scene includes several on-screen overlays: a blue minimap with green text is in the bottom-left corner, a blue display with an ammunition count is in the bottom-right, and orange, diamond-shaped icons with numbers float over distant objects.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
