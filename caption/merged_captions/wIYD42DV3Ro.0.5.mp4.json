  "merged_caption": "Initially, a wide, high-angle shot frames a pack of horses and jockeys spread from the center-left to the upper-right of the frame in the middle ground as they race along a brown dirt track. The track is initially visible curving from the bottom left to the top right. The camera smoothly pans left and tilts down to track the pack of racing horses as they round the bend, starting at an overhead level and zooming out as the horses approach the corner closest to it, creating the illusion of increased height while maintaining a deep focus that keeps all the horses and the track in sharp detail. The horses run in a tight pack as they race forward along the inside rail. The camera shifts to the right, following the collective movement of the horses as they navigate the turn and become more clustered toward the center of the frame. After the turn, the track occupies the entire left and middle sections of the frame. A white fence extends continuously from the foreground to the background, separating the track from a green grass infield. In the top left background, an outer fence and a building with a large sign are visible. A high-angle shot captures a group of horses and jockeys competing in the 148th Kentucky Derby. The jockeys, wearing colorful silks in red, blue, yellow, green, and purple, are crouched low as they race around a bend on a brown dirt track. An on-screen graphic in the lower-left corner lists several competing horses, such as \"EPICENTER\" and \"MESSIER,\" along with their corresponding numbers and betting odds. A timer in the upper-right corner indicates a time of 1:10.34 for the 3/4 mile mark, next to a network logo.",

    "Scene": "From a television broadcast-style viewpoint, a horse race unfolds on a wide dirt track during the daytime. The brown dirt track curves to the right, bordered on the inside by a white fence and a green grass infield. In the background, another fence and a building with a large sign are visible. A large pack of horses with jockeys in brightly colored silks gallops around the turn. Overlays are present on the screen. In the top right corner, a timer reads \"3/4 MILE 1:10.34\" next to a network logo. In the bottom left, a graphic for the \"148TH KENTUCKY DERBY\" displays a list of horses, their numbers, odds, and jockey silk designs, identifying one as the \"FAVORITE.\"",
    "Spatial": "Initially, a wide, high-angle shot frames a pack of horses and jockeys spread from the center-left to the upper-right of the frame in the middle ground as they race along a brown dirt track. The track is initially visible curving from the bottom left to the top right. The camera pans to the left for three seconds before shifting to the right, following the collective movement of the horses as they navigate the turn and become more clustered toward the center of the frame. After the turn, the track occupies the entire left and middle sections of the frame. A white fence extends continuously from the foreground to the background, separating the track from a green grass infield. In the top left background, an outer fence and a building are visible. An informational graphic and a timer overlay the video, with the graphic stationary in the bottom left and the timer and logo fixed in the top right."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
