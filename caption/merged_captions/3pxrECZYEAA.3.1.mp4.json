  "merged_caption": "The scene opens with a view of a surface that resembles a tabletop, set in a stylized, cartoon-like environment with an orange background. A red-colored hand is visible in the left foreground, holding a short glass filled with a swirling liquid that appears uniform with bright cyan and magenta patterns, influenced by the color of the glass. The hand rests on a white napkin stained with a wet ring. In the center, a green olive on a red toothpick lies in a small, brown puddle near the top of the frame. To the right, a small, solid pink elephant wearing a tiny yellow party hat walks from left to right across the surface. As the elephant moves to the right, the camera tracks it smoothly from the side, performing a quick zoom-in. The camera then transitions to an extreme close-up, focusing on the elephant's single visible eye, which has a blue and purple iris, eventually filling the entire frame.",

    "Scene": "In a stylized, animated scene set on a solid orange surface, a reddish-pink hand holds a glass containing a swirling liquid of cyan and pink. The hand holds the glass above a white napkin stained with a wet ring. Nearby, a spilled brown puddle surrounds a toothpick with a green olive. A small, pink elephant wearing a yellow party hat walks to the right across the surface, as the camera zooms into its single, detailed eye with a blue and purple iris.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
