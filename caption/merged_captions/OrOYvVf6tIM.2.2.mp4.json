  "merged_caption": "This is a static full shot of a light-skinned man, who appears to be in his late 20s or early 30s, framed through a dark doorway in the foreground. The man, with short, dark hair and a short beard, is wearing a blue, long-sleeved shirt with dark sleeves and dark-colored pants. He walks from the right side of the frame to the center and remains in the middle ground of the room, holding an open, medium-sized cardboard box in front of him with both hands. The scene is set in a dimly lit living room with light yellow walls and a darker, paneled upper section. Behind him, also in the middle ground, is a white coffee table holding a decorative bowl, positioned in front of a gray sofa against the back wall. Some red items are on the gray sofa. The background consists of the back wall, which features a lit table lamp with a circular base and a drum shade on the center-left, a stereo system on the center-right, and framed artwork. In the lower right of the middle ground, there is a small gray single-seater sofa. The room has hardwood floors, a patterned area rug, and a tall shelving unit containing numerous media cases. The man stands still, turns his head slightly to his left, and then back to the center as he looks down into the box he holds, maintaining a serious expression. In the foreground, a door transitions from half-open to closed, but due to the dim lighting, only the dark door frame is visible. The camera remains stationary at the man's level throughout the shot, using a deep focus to keep the entire room in sharp detail.",

    "Scene": "The scene is set in a dimly lit living room, viewed from a dark doorway. The room features light yellow walls with a darker, paneled upper section. A gray sofa is positioned against the back wall, fronted by a white coffee table holding a decorative bowl. Some red items are on the gray sofa. Warm light is cast by a table lamp with a circular base and a drum shade. To the right of the sofa, a tall shelving unit contains numerous media cases and a stereo system. The room has hardwood floors, a patterned area rug, and framed artwork on the walls. A man wearing a dark and blue shirt and pants stands in the middle of the room holding an open cardboard box.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
