  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a high-angle wide shot of a valley, where a glowing line is positioned in the bottom center foreground. Buildings and trees occupy the middle ground on the left and right, with a vertical HUD element on the far left. The camera, shot from a first-person perspective, is initially static with some shaking, then tilts up briefly before tilting down to a high-angle view looking over a ledge. A glowing rope is thrown down into the dark, green-tinted valley, enhanced by a night vision effect. The camera tilts down, introducing a rifle into the bottom right foreground and establishing a first-person perspective. The glowing line is now seen as a rope extending from the left foreground downwards. The view shifts to holding a rifle, and the perspective moves downwards along a slope toward a wooden structure below. The camera pans slightly to the left and then centers on the area at the base of the structure. The camera moves forward and down, maintaining the high-angle view, shifting focus from the wide valley to a wooden structure that comes into view in the upper background. The rifle remains stationary in the bottom right foreground, while HUD elements, including an ammunition counter, are visible in the left and bottom right corners. The setting is dark, with a greenish tint, suggesting night vision or a similar effect, and the scene unfolds in a dimly lit urban area with several buildings visible in the distance, their windows faintly illuminated. The video also features video game overlays, including a \"checkpoint\" message that appears at the end, providing additional information without being part of the physical setting. The shot concludes with a slight forward movement.",

    "Camera": "This first-person perspective video is shot from an eye-level, level angle, using a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. The slightly unsteady camera is initially static with some shaking, then tilts up briefly before tilting down to a high-angle view looking over a ledge. The shot concludes with a slight forward movement.",
    "Subject": "The video features a first-person perspective. It begins with a wide shot showing a rope with a glowing appearance, enhanced by the night vision effect, being thrown into a valley, with distant buildings and trees visible. The scene transitions to a high-angle shot of a gun pointed downward, capturing a wide view of the valley and a rooftop below. The setting is dark, with a greenish tint, suggesting night vision or a similar effect.",
    "Motion": "From a first-person perspective, a glowing rope is thrown down into a dark, green-tinted valley. The view then shifts to holding a rifle, and the perspective moves downwards along a slope toward a wooden structure below. The camera pans slightly to the left and then centers on the area at the base of the structure.",
    "Scene": "The video offers a first-person POV shot set in a dark, outdoor environment at night, viewed through a green-tinted night vision effect that enhances the atmosphere. The scene unfolds in a dimly lit urban area with several buildings visible in the distance, their windows faintly illuminated. The setting includes a mix of natural and architectural elements, such as trees and structures, under a dark sky. A notable visual element is a glowing rope that the character, from whose perspective we are viewing the scene, throws down a cliff. This adds a dynamic aspect to the otherwise static environment. The video also features video game overlays, including an ammunition counter in the bottom right corner and a \"checkpoint\" message that appears at the end, providing additional information without being part of the physical setting.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
