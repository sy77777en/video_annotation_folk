  "merged_caption": "The video starts with an extreme wide shot, where a light-skinned man with tattoos visible on his neck and left hand is skateboarding, positioned in the center-right of the frame in the middle ground, with a large, multi-story building with a light-colored facade and a grid of numerous windows with louvered shutters occupying the background. The man is wearing an orange long-sleeved sweatshirt with black text on the front, dark blue jeans, a brown belt, a dark navy beanie, and light-colored sneakers with dark accents. He rides a skateboard with a wooden top and white wheels. The camera, from an eye-level, level-angle perspective, begins with deep focus and then smoothly zooms in and pans left to track the skateboarder as he moves across a modern urban plaza from right to left, adjacent to a street with active traffic. The shot transitions into a medium shot, bringing the subject into the foreground as he approaches a low, dark, polished stone ledge in the center of the plaza. He crouches and then jumps, popping the board into the air. The skateboard flips as he clears the ledge, which is in the immediate foreground, and he lands back on the board on the sidewalk below before continuing to skate away. During the landing, a car moves into the foreground from the left, temporarily obscuring the skateboarder. Once the car exits the frame, the skateboarder returns to the foreground, with a street containing active traffic now visible in the background. The camera continues to pan left, following him as he skates away toward the left side of the frame, concluding with an upward tilt as he stands up. At the end, it transitions to a medium full shot of the skateboarder.",

    "Camera": "From an eye-level, level-angle perspective, the camera begins with deep focus. It then smoothly zooms in and pans left to track a skateboarder, causing the depth of field to become shallower and blurring the background. As the skateboarder becomes larger in the frame, the camera continues to follow him, concluding with an upward tilt as he stands up.",
    "Subject": "A light-skinned man with tattoos visible on his neck and left hand is skateboarding. He is wearing an orange long-sleeved sweatshirt with black text on the front, dark blue jeans, a brown belt, and a dark navy beanie. On his feet are light-colored sneakers with dark accents. He rides a skateboard that has a wooden top and white wheels. The man performs a trick, causing the skateboard to flip in the air before he lands back on it.",
    "Motion": "A man on a skateboard rides across a paved plaza toward a ledge. He crouches and then jumps, popping the board into the air. The skateboard flips as he clears the ledge, and he lands back on the board on the pavement below before continuing to skate away. The camera pans to follow his movement.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set in a modern urban plaza during the day, adjacent to a street with active traffic. A large, multi-story building with a light-colored facade and a grid of numerous windows with louvered shutters dominates the background. The ground floor of this building features several commercial storefronts. In the center of the plaza, a low, dark, polished stone ledge is present. Cars are parked along the curb and move along the road, while pedestrians walk on the sidewalks. A few green trees are interspersed throughout the scene, along with traffic lights and street lamps. A person on a skateboard moves across the plaza and jumps over the ledge onto the lower sidewalk.",
    "Spatial": "The video starts with an extreme wide shot, where a skateboarder is positioned in the center-right of the frame in the middle ground, with a large building occupying the background. The camera pans left and zooms in, tracking the skateboarder as he moves across a plaza from right to left. The shot transitions into a medium shot, bringing the subject into the foreground as he approaches a low, dark stone ledge. He jumps over the ledge, which is in the immediate foreground, and lands on the sidewalk below. During the landing, a car moves into the foreground from the left, temporarily obscuring the skateboarder. Once the car exits the frame, the skateboarder returns to the foreground, with a street containing active traffic now visible in the background. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, continues to pan left, following him as he skates away toward the left side of the frame. At the end, it transitions to a medium full shot of the skateboarder."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
