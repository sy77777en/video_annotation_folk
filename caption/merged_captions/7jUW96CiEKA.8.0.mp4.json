  "merged_caption": "This wide shot features a large white bird, likely an egret, with a long neck and slender legs, positioned slightly right of center in the middle ground, wading in shallow water. Its smooth, bright plumage contrasts with its dark legs and pointed yellow beak. The water occupies the bottom half of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground, where the egret's reflection is visible below it. An eroded riverbank fills the central and upper horizontal position of the frame, with dry, brown, and some green grassy vegetation along its upper edge. The camera, positioned above water, starts with a slow pan to the left, focusing on the egret by the water's edge. The egret slowly walks from right to left along the bank within the water, moving slightly towards the center-left of the frame, maintaining a steady pace with its neck extended forward in a focused manner, possibly scanning the water for potential food. The camera then remains static, maintaining a level angle. The deep focus ensures both the egret and its surroundings are sharp, with smooth, steady movement throughout. The setting includes a body of calm, murky water reflecting the surroundings, and the lighting suggests it is daytime. The background consists of a steep, eroded dirt bank with exposed soil layers, indicating a natural habitat. The egret's feet are partially submerged in the shallow water, and it appears to be foraging or observing its surroundings. The camera's position at the egret's level enhances the view of the natural, possibly wetland environment, with the bird's reflection visible on the water's surface.",

    "Subject": "The video features a large white bird, likely an egret, with a long neck and slender legs. Its plumage is smooth and bright, contrasting with its dark legs and pointed yellow beak. The bird is positioned in the water near the riverbank with its feet partially submerged in shallow water,  partially reflected in the surface. It appears to be foraging or observing its surroundings, with its neck extended forward in a focused manner. The setting includes grassy vegetation and a muddy bank, indicating a natural habitat.",
    "Motion": "A white bird, likely an egret, is seen walking slowly along the edge of a river, with its reflection visible in the water. The bird continues to move forward, maintaining a steady pace and keeping its head slightly lowered, possibly scanning the water for potential food. The background consists of a grassy bank and some scattered vegetation, indicating a natural, possibly wetland environment.",
    "Scene": "The video shows an outdoor scene set during the day. It features a body of calm, murky water reflecting the surroundings. Along the edge of the water is a steep, eroded dirt bank with exposed soil layers. Dry, brown, and some green grassy vegetation grows along the top edge and sparsely down the bank. A large, white bird with a long neck and a yellow beak stands in the shallow water near the bank, its reflection visible on the water's surface. The lighting suggests it is daytime.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
