  "merged_caption": "This video is shot from a first-person POV, beginning with a close-up where two hands are visible: one in the bottom left foreground and another in the bottom right, both touching a music box that is centrally positioned. From a ground-level position, the shot begins with a high angle looking down at the music box, which is made of dark wood with intricate, swirling carvings on its front panel and features an oval inlay with the initials \"DP\" in a script font. The interior is painted with a reddish color, revealing the music box's mechanism: a large, brass-colored, pinned cylinder and a steel comb. A hand adjusts the right crank handle, causing both the handle and the fixed cylinder to rotate, plucking the tines of the steel comb to play a melody. As the hands move out of the frame, the camera performs a very smooth upward tilt, transitioning into a medium shot that reveals about half of the music box. The box occupies the center of the frame, with its base in the foreground and its open lid in the middle ground. Taped to the inside of the open lid is a faded, sepia-toned photograph of a brightly lit carnival at night, dominated by a large, illuminated Ferris wheel, alongside two small, aged ticket stubs tucked into the bottom left corner of the photograph. A child's crayon drawing of a smiling yellow sun and a Ferris wheel is positioned in the left middle ground, while on the right side, there is a green puzzle-like object. The softly lit background contains out-of-focus toys such as colorful balls, building blocks, a train, and figurines scattered around. The camera maintains a shallow depth of field, with the focus locked on the music box in the foreground.",

    "Camera": "From a ground-level position, this shot begins with a high angle looking down at a music box. The camera maintains a shallow depth of field, with the focus locked on the music box in the foreground. The camera then performs a very smooth upward tilt, which shifts the perspective to a level angle, bringing the photograph inside the music box lid into full view.",
    "Subject": "From a first-person perspective, a light-skinned hand briefly touches the side of an open, antique-style music box before moving out of frame. The music box is made of dark wood with intricate, swirling carvings on its front panel, which also features an oval inlay with the initials \"DP\" in a script font. The interior is painted with a reddish color, revealing the music box's mechanism: a large, brass-colored, pinned cylinder and a steel comb. On the inside of the lid, a faded, sepia-toned photograph of a brightly lit carnival at night is taped, with a large Ferris wheel as its centerpiece. Two small, aged ticket stubs are tucked into the bottom left corner of the photograph. To the left of the music box is a piece of paper with a child's crayon drawing of a smiling yellow sun and a Ferris wheel, while on the right side, there is a green, puzzle-like object.",
    "Motion": "A hand adjusts the right crank handle of an open music box before moving out of frame. Both the handle and the fixed cylinder inside the music box rotate, plucking the tines of a steel comb to play a melody. The camera tilts upward to reveal the full view of the opened music box.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, focuses on an open, antique-style wooden music box resting on a textured surface. The dark wood box features intricate carvings on its front panel and has a brownish-red interior. Inside, a brass-colored cylinder with pins is positioned above a metal comb, and a crank handle is visible on the right. Taped to the inside of the open lid is a faded, sepia-toned photograph of a carnival at night, dominated by a large, illuminated Ferris wheel, alongside two small ticket stubs. To the left of the box lies a child's drawing of a smiling yellow sun and a Ferris wheel, while on the right side, there is a green puzzle-like object. The softly lit background contains out-of-focus toys such as colorful balls, building blocks, a train, and figurines scattered around.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
