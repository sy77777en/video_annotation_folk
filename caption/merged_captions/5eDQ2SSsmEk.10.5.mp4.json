  "merged_caption": "This is a wide shot of a dark, industrial scene, framed from a high-angle perspective looking almost straight down. A large structure occupies the right side of the frame in the middle ground, featuring a vertical strip of amber lights. Attached to this structure, a metal platform with scaffolding sits in the center. The foreground is dominated by falling precipitation, which is illuminated by bright white spotlights located in the lower part of the scene, center-left and center-right. Several small red lights are visible in the middle ground, positioned on the edge portion of the platform, center-left of the scene. From a high, aerial perspective, the camera moves slowly and smoothly from right to left, revealing an external platform of a tall building. Bright spotlights and red warning lights illuminate the heavy rain falling between the industrial structures, creating a moody, atmospheric setting. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The video showcases a futuristic cityscape with a focus on a single, towering structure that dominates the frame. The high-angle shot captures the building as the central subject, around which the environment is constructed. Bright spotlights and glowing red and yellow lights pierce through the rain, illuminating the wet, metallic surfaces and complex industrial architecture, including visible pipes and scaffolding. The scene emphasizes the overwhelming scale and moody atmosphere, creating a strong sense of place and feeling. Heavy precipitation, appearing as rain or snow, falls through the hazy air, illuminated by bright white spotlights that cast distinct beams. The platform is adorned with small red circular lights, and a vertical strip of glowing amber lights is visible on the building to the right. Faint details of metallic scaffolding and pipes are observable on the platform, and from this vantage point, one can look down to see a city night view.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
