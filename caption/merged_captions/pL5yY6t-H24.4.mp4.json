  "merged_caption": "A full shot captures a white passenger airplane with Flybe livery in the middle ground, initially positioned in the center of the frame and angled away from the camera. The aircraft's tall, white tail fin is marked with the full \"flybe.\" logo, with the lighter blue \"fly\" portion visible on the fuselage just below the tail and the darker blue \"be.\" prominently displayed on the wing. The airline's name, \"flybe.\", is also written a second time in blue lowercase letters on the side of the plane, above the wing, with a small accent of yellow, orange, and red dots beneath it. The plane has two jet engines mounted under its wings and is supported by its landing gear. In the bottom left foreground, a taxiway sign is visible, consisting of a black square with \"A1\" in yellow text next to a red square with \"27\" in white text. Houses with grey slate roofs and white walls, some with distinctive turret-like architectural features, and green trees are situated in the background. The airplane taxis slowly from the right side of the frame toward the left-front along a paved runway under a clear blue sky. As the camera, positioned at the subject's level, pans left to follow the aircraft, the plane makes a slight left turn to adjust its direction, maintaining a steady pace as it moves across the frame. The camera zooms in slightly, and the plane shifts to the left side of the frame, especially noticeable after the zoom-in. Consequently, the taxiway sign in the foreground shifts from the bottom left toward the bottom center. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp, but remains noticeably shaky throughout the shot.",

    "Camera": "From an eye-level and level angle, the camera uses a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The shot is unsteady, with the camera panning left to track the airplane, zooming in slightly, and then stopping while remaining noticeably shaky.",
    "Subject": "A white passenger airplane with Flybe livery is positioned on a paved runway, viewed from a rear three-quarter angle.

    "Motion": "A white passenger airplane, adorned with Flybe livery, is seen slowly taxiing from the right side of the frame to the left along a paved runway. As the camera zooms in, the airplane makes a slight left turn to adjust its direction, maintaining a steady pace as it moves across the frame.",
    "Scene": "An outdoor scene at an airport shows a white passenger airplane taxiing on an asphalt runway under a clear blue sky. The plane, featuring blue and multi-colored livery with \"flybe\" written on its side, moves across the scene. In the foreground, a grassy area contains a taxiway sign, which includes a black square displaying \"A1\" in yellow text alongside a red square with \"27\" in white text. The background is composed of green trees and a row of houses with grey slate roofs and white walls, some of which have distinctive turret-like architectural features.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
