  "merged_caption": "The static shot begins with overgrown grass at the bottom of the frame in the foreground, while a chain-link fence is situated in the middle ground. In the background, a dark, elevated roadway is visible. The video begins in darkness with the sound of a siren. An emergency vehicle, identified by its flashing red and blue lights, is then revealed moving from left to right along the road in the distance. The vehicle enters the wide shot from the left, moving from left to right along the background roadway before stopping in the middle-left of the frame. The camera is completely static, positioned at eye level with a level angle, and a deep focus is used, keeping the entire scene sharp. The scene looks out from behind a chain-link fence and overgrown grass. In the background, on an elevated roadway, the vehicle with flashing red and blue lights and a loud, wailing siren moves across the frame from left to right before stopping in the middle of the road, slightly to the left. The vehicle, which is a dark silhouette, is identified by its flashing red and blue lights as it moves along a road in the background.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
