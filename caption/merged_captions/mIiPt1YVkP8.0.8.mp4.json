  "merged_caption": "The video starts with a full shot of a dark gray, two-engine commercial airplane, labeled \"UAL 1,\" positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground on a dark airport taxiway at night. Glowing green taxiway lines curve from the foreground toward the airplane. The camera, from a slightly shaky, level angle, uses a shallow depth of field to focus on this first airplane. The taxiway is marked with glowing green lines, and the background features an indistinct, seemingly untextured grayish ground that extends into the distance beneath a completely black sky. The camera then moves backward slightly and pans left, shifting its focus to reveal a second, similar-looking dark gray, two-engine commercial airplane, labeled \"PAL 115,\" as it enters the frame. This second airplane is positioned on the same taxiway, appearing to be parked behind the first airplane. The first airplane, \"UAL 1,\" is moved to the right middle ground, while the second airplane, \"PAL 115,\" is brought into a full shot in the center of the frame and the middle ground. White text overlays with a slight glow are positioned above each aircraft, identifying them as \"UAL 1\" and \"PAL 115.\" The camera remains positioned above the subjects' level throughout the shot, capturing the two passenger airplanes on a curved path marked by glowing green lines. The first airplane is stationary, and the second airplane, identified as \"PAL 115,\" is also stationary, positioned behind the first airplane.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
