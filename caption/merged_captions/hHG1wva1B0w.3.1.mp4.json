  "merged_caption": "The video presents a full shot of a classic car, centrally positioned in the middle ground of the frame, with a smooth, beige exterior and distinct curves. The car occupies the center both horizontally and vertically, with no other objects or elements in the foreground or background. The camera, positioned at eye level and using deep focus for a large depth of field, smoothly arcs counterclockwise around the car, maintaining a consistent level with it to ensure it remains the focal point. The car remains stationary throughout the video, with no visible movement or changes in its position. The dimly lit indoor setting surrounds the car, creating a subdued atmosphere with soft shadows that enhance its contours. The lighting highlights the car's classic design, including its rounded headlights, simple bumper, one-door configuration with rounded windows, and curved roof. The floor is dark and unadorned, complementing the car's presence. An overlay element displaying the text \"[6]\" is consistently located in the lower left corner, adding a minor detail without detracting from the car's prominence. The static spatial framing, combined with the camera's smooth motion, highlights the car's timeless design and form without any dynamic shifts or transitions.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
