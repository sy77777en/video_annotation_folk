  "merged_caption": "This scenery video presents a wide shot from a low, water-level perspective, focusing initially on a dark, arched opening in the background, partially submerged in the murky, greenish water that occupies the lower portion of the frame. The camera, positioned just above the water in a tiled hallway, smoothly tilts up and pans right, transitioning the view from a level to a low angle. This motion swiftly reveals the full extent of the surreal and empty environment, a long, narrow, enclosed space like a corridor or channel. The walls and ceiling are uniformly covered in a grid of small, pale green tiles, creating a sterile and monotonous texture. Rows of bright, square lights are recessed into the ceiling, casting a stark, slightly greenish glow that reflects off the tiled surfaces and the water. As the camera pans to the right and tilts slightly upward, moving the opening off-screen to the left, it reveals the extended length of the corridor. In the final frame, the water remains at the bottom, a tiled wall is on the left, and the ceiling with rows of lights is visible at the top, leading to a distant doorway and steps in the background. The deep focus keeps the entire space sharp throughout the movement, emphasizing the eerie and isolating atmosphere of the environment. The composition and dynamic camera movement are designed to evoke a sense of unease, making the space itself the central point of interest. At the far end of the corridor, a brighter area contains a doorway and steps leading up from the water, adding to the liminal and slightly unsettling atmosphere of the location.",

    "Camera": "From a position just above the water in a tiled hallway, the camera smoothly tilts up and pans right. This motion transitions the view from a level to a low angle, revealing the ceiling lights and the far end of the hall. A deep focus keeps the entire space sharp throughout the movement.",
    "Subject": "This video presents an architectural scenery shot of a sterile and unsettling liminal space, specifically a long, narrow corridor filled with murky, greenish water. The walls are uniformly covered in small, pale green tiles, and the scene is illuminated by rows of bright, square lights recessed into the ceiling, casting a cold glow that reflects on the water's surface. The video begins with a wide shot of the corridor, capturing the full, empty expanse that culminates in a distant doorway and steps. Instead of a slow reveal, the camera quickly pans across the scene, emphasizing the eerie and isolating atmosphere of the environment. The composition and dynamic camera movement are designed to evoke a sense of unease, making the space itself the central point of interest.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenery shot with a brisk, deliberate camera movement. The camera starts at water level and quickly pulls back and tilts upward. This motion swiftly reveals the full extent of the surreal and empty environment.\n\nThe scene is a long, narrow, enclosed space, like a corridor or channel, filled with dark, rippling water. The walls and ceiling are uniformly covered in small, off-white or pale green tiles, creating a sterile and monotonous texture. Rows of bright, square lights are embedded in the ceiling, casting a stark, slightly greenish glow that reflects off the tiled surfaces and the water. At the far end of the corridor, a doorway and what appear to be steps leading out of the water are visible, adding to the liminal and slightly unsettling atmosphere of the location.",
    "Scene": "From a low perspective at water level, the scene unfolds within a long, narrow indoor channel filled with dark, murky green water. The walls and ceiling are uniformly covered in a grid of small, pale green tiles. Rows of bright, square lights are recessed into the ceiling, illuminating the sterile environment and reflecting off the wet surfaces. The camera quickly pans to the right from a dark, arched opening partially submerged in the water, revealing the extended length of the corridor. At the far end, a brighter area contains a doorway and steps leading up from the water.",
    "Spatial": "This scenery video presents a wide shot from a low, water-level perspective. The shot begins focused on a dark, arched opening in the background, which is partially submerged in the water that occupies the lower portion of the frame. The camera then pans to the right and tilts slightly upward, moving the opening off-screen to the left. This action reveals the full length of a narrow, tiled corridor that extends from the foreground into the background. In the final frame, the water remains at the bottom, a tiled wall is on the left, and the ceiling with rows of lights is visible at the top, leading to a distant doorway and steps in the background."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
