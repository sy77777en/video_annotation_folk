  "merged_caption": "In this 2D animated view, a red, C-shaped stomach structure initially curves from the top left, down across the bottom, and up toward the top right, occupying most of the frame. The scene is set against a solid red background. As the camera smoothly zooms out, the stomach becomes centered, revealing a stylized depiction of its interior with smooth, curving walls rendered in a deep red color. At the bottom of the stomach, a pool of yellowish-tan liquid is visible. Emerging from the center of this liquid are two thin green sprouts, each with multiple blades, which sway gently from side to side. This animation vividly illustrates the growth process of a green plant as it emerges from the germ, extends upward, and develops green leaves within the yellow liquid. The small, green plant with several green leaves growing from its branches adds a vibrant touch to the scene.",

    "Subject": "The video shows a stylized, animated depiction of the inside of a stomach. The stomach is a large, C-shaped organ rendered in a deep red color, with smooth, curving interior walls. At the bottom of the stomach rests a pool of yellowish-tan liquid. Sprouting vertically from the center of this liquid is a small, green plant with several green leaves growing from its branches, adding a vibrant touch to the scene.",

    "Scene": "An animated, cross-sectional view shows the interior of a red, C-shaped stomach against a solid red background. A pool of yellowish liquid rests at the bottom of the organ. Emerging from the center of this liquid are two thin green sprouts, each with multiple blades, which sway gently.",
    "Spatial": "In this 2D animated view, a red stomach structure initially curves from the top left, down across the bottom, and up toward the top right, occupying most of the frame. As the camera zooms out, the stomach becomes centered. Within the curve at the bottom, a pool of yellow liquid is visible. Two green sprouts with a few leaves emerge from the center of this liquid, swaying gently from side to side. The scene is set against a solid red background."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
