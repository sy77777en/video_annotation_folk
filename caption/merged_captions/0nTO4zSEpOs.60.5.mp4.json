  "merged_caption": "This wide shot initially frames a nighttime urban scene from an elevated pedestrian walkway. In the foreground and middle ground, the walkway stretches across the frame, populated by pedestrians. A man in a suit, holding a phone and a bag, walks towards the camera near the center foreground before moving towards the right. Another man walks away from the camera in the left middle ground, while a woman in a coat and yellow shoes walks towards the camera in the right middle ground. Illuminated buildings, including ones marked \"GMO\" and \"Tokyu Plaza,\" are positioned in the background, occupying the upper portion of the frame. The camera, positioned at roughly eye level with the pedestrians on the walkway, moves forward, slightly unsteady with some shaking, capturing more of the city's vibrant nightlife. As the camera progresses, it focuses on the busy street below, where numerous buses and cars are seen moving. The lower part of the frame, extending from the middle ground to the background, is filled with buses, cars, and more pedestrians. Elevated train tracks are visible in the background. The video concludes with a broader view of the bustling street, emphasizing the dynamic and lively urban environment. The camera pans to the right in the latter part, revealing more of the street-level activity, including a bus terminal area and buildings in the background. The scene is illuminated by artificial lights from the surrounding skyscrapers, creating a lively atmosphere. Notable architectural features include a mix of contemporary high-rises and commercial structures. The pedestrian walkway features white light tubes on the railings, illuminating the ground. Overlay elements include text at the bottom left corner, reading \"VIRTUAL JAPAN.TV,\" which is not part of the scene itself.",

    "Scene": "The video captures a bustling urban environment at night, set in a vibrant cityscape with towering buildings adorned with bright advertisements and digital billboards. The setting is outdoors, featuring a modern pedestrian walkway elevated above a busy street filled with traffic, including buses and cars. The scene is illuminated by artificial lights from the surrounding skyscrapers, creating a lively atmosphere. Notable architectural features include a mix of contemporary high-rises and commercial structures, with a prominent building labeled \"Tokyo Plaza.\" The pedestrian walkway features white light tubes on the railings, illuminating the ground. It is paved with light-colored tiles and has railings made of metal and glass. Pedestrians, some wearing coats, walk along the walkway, adding a sense of motion and activity. Overlay elements include text at the bottom left corner, reading \"Virtual Japan,\" which is not part of the scene itself.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
