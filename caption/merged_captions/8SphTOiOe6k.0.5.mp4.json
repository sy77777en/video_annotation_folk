  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot capturing a bustling street scene in a Japanese town during the day. In the foreground, a man in a dark suit with a white mask and backpack stands on the right side of the frame, while a woman in a beige coat is positioned slightly to his right. As the camera, positioned at eye level with a level angle, moves forward with a slight unsteady shake, these subjects gradually exit the frame to the right. The camera maintains deep focus throughout, capturing a group of pedestrians walking towards it on the right side of the sidewalk, while others on the left move away. In the background, a group of people walks along the street, initially positioned centrally. The street is lined with traditional wooden buildings, detached houses with small yards, and trees with autumn foliage, extending into the background. A red 'Do Not Enter' sign is visible in the top right, and decorative pink and purple umbrellas are propped against a dark fence on the right, disappearing from the frame as the camera advances. The road is lined with utility poles under a blue sky with white clouds, and in the distance, a green mountain is visible. The camera moves forward with a slight pan to the left at the end, capturing the street scene as it advances down the street, providing a first-person perspective.",

    "Camera": "The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, maintaining deep focus throughout. It moves forward with a slight pan to the left at the end, capturing the street scene. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video captures a bustling street scene with several people and buildings. A man in a dark suit, wearing a white mask and carrying a backpack, stands on the sidewalk, while a woman with long hair in a beige coat is nearby. As the camera moves forward, both the man and the woman gradually exit the frame. In the distance, a group of people walks along the street. The buildings lining the street feature traditional architectural elements, and trees with autumn foliage add to the scene, depicting a typical day with people engaged in their activities.",
    "Motion": "The camera moves forward, capturing a group of pedestrians walking towards it on the right side of the sidewalk, while others on the left move away. In the foreground, a man wearing a face mask and carrying a backpack stands still on the right side of the frame, with a long-haired woman in a trench coat positioned ahead and to his right. As the camera advances, both figures exit the frame.",
    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a view down a paved street in a Japanese town during the day. The road is lined with traditional wooden buildings, detached houses with small yards, and utility poles under a blue sky with white clouds. In the distance, a green mountain is visible. A red circular 'Do Not Enter' sign is posted on a pole. Several pedestrians walk along the sidewalk on the right, and decorative pink and purple umbrellas are propped against a dark fence.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
