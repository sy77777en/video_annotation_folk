  "merged_caption": "A full shot frames a purple pot containing a small plant seedling, positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. The pot is placed inside a light-colored wooden box that extends from the foreground to the background. The entire scene is flanked by solid green vertical bars on the left and right sides of the frame. The camera is completely static, positioned at a high angle looking down at the plant, using a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. The seedling has a single thin stem and two large, heart-shaped green leaves with a distinct silvery-white mottled pattern. Initially, the leaves are somewhat curled, but as the time-lapse progresses, they gradually unfurl and expand horizontally, spreading out towards the left and right sides of the central frame, and then extend downwards. The leaves also shift their orientation, moving up and down as the lighting changes. The central stem's length slightly changes over time. The pot is filled with dark soil, and the lighting transitions between various types, including a spotlight from above that illuminates the plant and the wooden surface below, as well as a brighter, more diffuse light. Throughout the sequence, the plant's leaves can be seen subtly moving and extending outward over time, while the pot and camera remain stationary. The pot is positioned inside a light-colored wooden box. The entire scene is framed by solid green vertical bars on the left and right sides of the video. The actual camera height is unclear as the plant is inside a wooden box. The shot uses a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",

    "Camera": "This is a time-lapse video of a plant growing. The camera is completely static, positioned at a high angle looking down at the plant. The actual camera height is unclear as the plant is inside a wooden box. The shot uses a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "A small plant seedling with two large, heart-shaped green leaves is shown growing. The surfaces of the leaves feature a distinct silvery-white mottled pattern. The seedling, which has a single thin stem, is planted in dark soil inside a bright purple, cylindrical plastic pot with a flared rim. The pot is positioned inside a light-colored wooden box. The leaves of the plant unfurl, expand, and change their orientation over time.",
    "Motion": "This time-lapse video shows a small plant seedling growing. Its two large, heart-shaped leaves, initially partially folded, gradually expand outwards. The leaves also shift their orientation, moving up and down as the lighting changes, while the central stem's length slightly changes.",
    "Scene": "A time-lapse video shows a small seedling in a purple plastic pot, set inside a box made of light-colored wood. The seedling has a single stem and two large, heart-shaped green leaves with a distinct silvery, mottled pattern. The pot is filled with dark soil. Throughout the sequence, the lighting transitions between various types, including a spotlight from above that illuminates the plant and the wooden surface below, as well as a brighter, more diffuse light. The plant's leaves can be seen subtly moving and extending outward over time. The entire scene is framed by solid green vertical bars on the left and right sides of the video.",
    "Spatial": "A full shot frames a purple pot containing a small plant seedling, positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. The pot is placed inside a light-colored wooden box that extends from the foreground to the background. The entire scene is flanked by solid green vertical bars on the left and right sides of the frame. The camera is positioned above the subject, looking down at the plant. Throughout the time-lapse, the plant's two leaves, initially somewhat curled, unfurl and expand horizontally, spreading out towards the left and right sides of the central frame, and then extend downwards, while the pot and camera remain stationary."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
