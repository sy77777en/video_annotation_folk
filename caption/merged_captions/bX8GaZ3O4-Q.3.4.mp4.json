  "merged_caption": "This full shot is framed on an open, dark-colored safe, which is positioned in the center of the frame and set into a wall in the middle ground. The safe's door, which appears distorted as if forced open, is swung open toward the right edge of the frame and features three small, glowing pinkish-purple circular lights arranged vertically along its edge. Inside, two shelves are visible, with a stack of white papers on the bottom shelf, displaying a circular emblem on the topmost sheet, while multiple sheets of paper lie on the upper shelf. In the foreground, almost the entire lamp is visible on the left, sitting on a teal table that occupies the bottom-left corner. The lamp has a teal, bell-shaped shade and an ornate, fluted base that appears to be made of gold or brass. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, using a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp, and the framing has a slight shakiness. This is a slightly unsteady, static shot from a low angle, capturing a dark room bathed in blue and purple light. The safe's silvery frame has a distorted, almost melted appearance. The scene is static, with no movement from any of the subjects.",

    "Subject": "An open, dark-colored safe is built into a wall, its door swung open to the right. The edge of the thick door appears distorted, suggesting it may have been forced open, and features three small, glowing pinkish-purple circular lights arranged vertically. The safe's frame is silvery with a distorted, almost melted appearance. Inside, two shelves are visible. On the bottom shelf rests a stack of white papers, with a circular emblem visible on the topmost sheet, while multiple sheets of paper lie on the upper shelf. To the left of the safe, a table lamp with a teal, bell-shaped shade sits on a teal table. The lamp has an ornate, fluted base that appears to be made of gold or brass.",

    "Scene": "In a dark room bathed in blue and purple light, an open safe is set into a wall. The safe has a dark frame, and its door, which is ajar, features three glowing purple lights along its edge. Inside, two shelves hold stacks of paper, with a circular seal visible on the documents on the lower shelf. To the left, a lamp with a teal shade and a golden base rests on a small table.",
    "Spatial": "This full shot is framed on an open safe, which is positioned in the center of the frame and set into a wall in the middle ground. The safe's door is swung open toward the right edge of the frame. Inside, papers rest on two shelves, also in the middle ground.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
