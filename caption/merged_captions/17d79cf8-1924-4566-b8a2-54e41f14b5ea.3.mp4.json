  "merged_caption": "From a first-person perspective looking down, the initial frame shows the person's feet in blue flip-flops positioned in the middle ground. Their hands are also visible, with the right hand picking up a red brick from a pile at the top of the frame and the left hand holding another brick in the bottom left. Numerous red bricks are scattered across the middle ground, predominantly in the top half and center of the frame. A green bowl containing a gray mixture sits in the bottom left middle ground, resting on the reddish-brown dust that covers the ground. The video begins with a first-person perspective at hip level, looking almost straight down at the ground with an upside-down high angle. As the person stands up and begins to walk to the left, the camera moves upward to eye level, rolling counterclockwise with noticeable shaking. The camera then pans and rotates as the person turns. In the final view, the feet remain in the middle ground. The left hand still holds a brick in the bottom left foreground. The green bowl is now in the center-left middle ground, and a second, gray bowl with mixture is visible in the center-right middle ground. Bricks are now concentrated more towards the right middle ground. A partially constructed brick wall appears in the middle ground, in the top left of the frame, with some greenery visible in the far left background. Another green bowl appears in the lower center middle ground. The environment is dry, and the overall scene conveys a sense of manual labor and construction activity. The camera maintains deep focus with a large depth of field throughout, capturing the scene clearly despite the slight unsteadiness.",

    "Camera": "The video begins with a first-person perspective at hip level, looking almost straight down at the ground with an upside-down high angle. As the person stands and turns, the camera moves upward to eye level, rolling counterclockwise with noticeable shaking. The angle transitions to a bird's-eye view by the end. The camera maintains deep focus with a large depth of field throughout, capturing the scene clearly despite the slight unsteadiness.",
    "Subject": "The video features a person engaged in construction work, captured from a head-mounted camera perspective. The individual, with medium skin tone, is wearing a light-colored shirt with rolled-up sleeves, purple patterned shorts with buttons, and blue flip-flops. They are holding a brick in their left hand while picking up bricks from the ground with their right hand. Red bricks are scattered on the ground, and a green bowl containing a gray mixture, likely cement, is nearby. In another part of the video, a partially constructed brick wall is visible, along with more bricks and construction materials on the ground, suggesting an outdoor construction site.",
    "Motion": "A person, wearing a light-colored shirt and blue flip-flops, is seen picking up a red brick with their right hand from a pile of similar bricks on the ground, while already holding another brick in their left hand. The person then stands up and begins to walk to the left. The background shows a construction site with more bricks, a green basin containing cement, and a partially constructed brick wall.",
    "Scene": "The video, captured from a first-person POV, takes place outdoors during the day at a construction site with a focus on bricklaying. The ground is covered with reddish-brown dirt and scattered bricks, some whole and others broken. A person’s hands are visible, interacting with the bricks, indicating active construction work. Two round containers filled with gray cement are present, suggesting ongoing masonry tasks. In the background, a partially constructed brick wall is visible, while greenery is located on the ground outside the construction area, adding a natural element to the scene. The environment is dry. The overall scene conveys a sense of manual labor and construction activity.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
