  "merged_caption": "The video features a medium shot of a woman performing push-ups in a gym setting. She is wearing a dark sports bra, bright pink shorts, and fingerless gloves, with her long hair tied back. Initially, the camera focuses on her upper body, including her head, arms, and torso, positioned on the left side of the frame. The scene takes place on a smooth, polished wooden floor, with natural light streaming in and casting soft shadows, creating a warm, dynamic atmosphere. As the sequence progresses, the woman starts in a plank position, lowers her body towards the ground, and then pushes back up repeatedly. The camera, positioned at ground level with a shallow depth of field, smoothly trucks right to maintain focus on her position, transitioning to capture her midsection, arms, torso, hips, and upper legs. Her hands, clad in fingerless gloves, are prominently featured, while her entire body is considered as a whole and placed in the foreground. The polished wooden floor extends from the foreground to the background, providing a consistent backdrop across the frame. The camera maintains a steady perspective at the subject's level, ensuring a clear view of her movements throughout the sequence. At the end, the camera slightly pans left, maintaining minimal shaking, and the large mirror in the background reflects the dynamic atmosphere of the gym space. The lighting suggests daytime, emphasizing her athletic posture and form as she engages in the workout.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
