  "merged_caption": "This wide shot begins with a woman in a purple dress standing in the center foreground on a wooden boardwalk, looking into an animal enclosure that occupies the middle ground. An elephant is partially visible in the far left middle ground, near a tan building in the background. As the camera, from a smooth, eye-level perspective, trucks and pans to the right along the boardwalk, the woman in purple shifts to the left of the frame and exits. A couple enters from the right foreground, walking along the boardwalk but remains in the right foreground. The woman in the couple has shoulder-length brown hair and is wearing a cream-colored top, a long teal skirt, and carries a large blue and white tote bag. The man walking with her has short dark hair, wears a white face mask, a blue denim jacket over a white t-shirt, and dark pants. Other visitors are visible walking in the middle ground on the right, observing the animal enclosures. The pan reveals more of the park's trees and an elevated track in the background. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping both the people in the midground and the elephant enclosure in the background sharp and clear. A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, combines trucking and panning to the right along a wooden boardwalk at an outdoor animal park during the day. The boardwalk has a brown wooden top rail and metal and glass safety barriers, overlooking a large enclosure with a dirt ground, a moat-like body of water, and gray rock formations. In the distance, beyond the park's lush green trees, a light blue elevated track and a tall, dark tower are visible against an overcast sky as other visitors walk along the path.",

    "Camera": "From a smooth, eye-level perspective, the camera trucks and pans to the right, following a group of people as they walk along a wooden boardwalk at a zoo.

    "Subject": "A group of people are seen on a wooden boardwalk at what appears to be a zoo. A woman with her back to the camera stands looking at an enclosure; she has brown hair in a ponytail and wears a long, light purple dress and a grey backpack. A couple walks past her from the right. The woman in the couple has shoulder-length brown hair and is wearing a cream-colored top, a long teal skirt, and carries a large blue and white tote bag. The man walking with her has short dark hair, wears a white face mask, a blue denim jacket over a white t-shirt, and dark pants. Other people are visible in the middle ground.",

    "Scene": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, combines trucking and panning to the right along a wooden boardwalk at an outdoor animal park during the day. The boardwalk has a brown wooden top rail and metal and glass safety barriers, overlooking a large enclosure with a dirt ground, a moat-like body of water, and gray rock formations. A one-story, tan-colored building with a flat roof stands at the back of the enclosure, where an elephant is partially visible. In the distance, beyond the park's lush green trees, a light blue elevated track and a tall, dark tower are visible against an overcast sky as other visitors walk along the path.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
