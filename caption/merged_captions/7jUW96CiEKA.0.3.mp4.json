  "merged_caption": "The video presents an extreme wide shot of a sunlit valley, capturing a vast landscape with a shallow river meandering through a grassy plain in the foreground. The river is positioned slightly left of center, extending towards the right. Several deer-like animals are scattered around the river, primarily in the bottom center of the frame, occupying the foreground. The middle ground features rolling hills covered with green trees, stretching across the frame from left to right. In the background, a range of hills rises against a clear blue sky, forming the upper portion of the frame. The camera is positioned at a height that allows a comprehensive view of the landscape, emphasizing the expansive and serene quality of the scene. The video is shot at eye level with a level angle, capturing a landscape scene. The camera is static, maintaining a deep focus with a large depth of field, ensuring clarity across the entire scene. In this vast grassland with a backdrop of lush green trees and rolling hills, a group of animals is seen near a small water body. The animals appear to be gathered around the water, possibly drinking or resting. The landscape remains consistent throughout the frames, with no significant changes in the environment or the animals' positions. The focus is on the expansive environment, highlighting the natural beauty and tranquility of the scene. The absence of a main subject emphasizes the scale and atmosphere, allowing viewers to appreciate the serene and untouched quality of the landscape. The video shows a wide, sunlit valley during the day, with a shallow river meandering through a grassy plain in the foreground. In the background, rolling hills covered with green trees and some patches of drier vegetation rise against a clear blue sky.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
