  "merged_caption": "This wide shot is captured from a high-angle perspective, looking down into a deep, brown, rocky canyon that serves as the background. A small, pixelated character with a dark blue, round head featuring large eyes and a yellow bird's beak, a red torso, and a cape or scarf that occasionally waves behind him, begins near the center of the frame in the middle ground. The character's legs and arms are dark blue, matching his head. Scattered throughout the canyon are sandy ledges, with a red and white striped beach umbrella visible on a larger ledge in the upper center-right. The character moves diagonally upwards and to the right across a steep, brown canyon wall, leaving a white trail of dust. It glides past the umbrella perched on a ledge with grass and two pine trees nearby, continuing its ascent steadily toward the top of the screen. The camera, from a high, aerial angle, smoothly tracks the avatar as it climbs, first moving upward, then slightly forward, before arcing counter-clockwise around the character. Several UI elements are overlaid: a coin counter is fixed in the top left corner displaying the number \"104\" next to a coin icon, a feather counter is in the bottom left showing five golden feathers that gradually change to blue as the character expends stamina, and a compass is in the top right with a red and white needle over a dark circular shadow, indicating \"N\" for north.",

    "Subject": "A small, pixelated character is depicted with a dark blue, round head featuring large eyes and a yellow bird's beak. He has a red torso and is wearing a cape or possibly a scarf that occasionally waves behind him. His legs and arms are dark blue, matching his head. When he runs, he leaves a white trail of dust. In the upper right portion of the scene, a red and white striped beach umbrella is situated on a ledge. The user interface in the bottom left corner displays five golden feathers that gradually turn blue as the character expends stamina. In the top left corner, a counter shows the number 104 next to an icon of a coin. A small compass with a white \"N\" is visible in the top right.",

    "Scene": "In a third-person 3D game video where the entire character is visible on screen, the setting is a deep, narrow canyon with steep, brown, textured rock walls. The scene, rendered in a pixelated style, features small, sandy-colored ledges at various heights, some dotted with green vegetation. On a prominent upper ledge, a red and white striped beach umbrella stands open. A small, pixelated character climbs up the canyon walls. Overlays are present on the screen: the top-left corner displays a coin icon next to the number \"104\" in a white pixelated font, the bottom-left corner shows a row of five golden feathers that gradually change to blue as the character climbs, and the top-right corner features a red and white needle over a dark circular shadow, with the red needle indicating \"N\" for north.",
    "Spatial": "This wide shot is captured from a high-angle perspective, looking down into a deep, brown, rocky canyon that serves as the background. A small, bird-like character begins near the center of the frame in the middle ground. Scattered throughout the canyon are sandy ledges, with a red and white umbrella visible on a larger ledge in the upper center-right. Several UI elements are overlaid: a coin counter is fixed in the top left corner, a feather counter is in the bottom left, and a compass is in the top right."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
