  "merged_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot, framing two individuals, one wearing red and the other in black, in the center-right and middle ground as they lie on their stomachs on a table covered with a light-colored cloth. To the left, two tall-backed chairs with purple and gold patterned upholstery occupy the foreground and middle ground, set against dark green curtains in the background. A part of a chandelier is visible above. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level, capturing the scene in slow motion from a fixed but slightly unsteady, low, hip-level angle, utilizing deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. Suddenly, a large volume of water erupts from the right side of the frame, moving left and forcefully crashing into the individuals. This powerful wave of rushing water completely engulfs their heads and upper bodies, obscuring them from view. The water now fills the center and right of the frame, causing the subjects to disappear from view. A watermark for \"MOVIECLIPS.COM\" is present in the bottom left corner.",

    "Subject": "Two individuals, one wearing red and the other in black, are lying on their stomachs on a table covered with a light-colored cloth. A massive wave of rushing water erupts from the right side of the scene, forcefully hitting and completely engulfing both individuals' heads and upper bodies. To the left, two tall-backed chairs with purple and gold patterned upholstery are visible. The individuals are almost entirely obscured by the water by the end of the clip.",
    "Motion": "Two people are lying on a table when a large volume of water erupts from the right side of the frame, forcefully crashing into them. The individuals are immediately engulfed by the massive splash, which completely obscures them from view.",
    "Scene": "In a formally decorated room with dark green curtains in the background, two individuals, one wearing red and the other in black, are positioned on their stomachs on a table. Suddenly, they are engulfed by a powerful wave of rushing water. The room features high-backed chairs upholstered in a purple and gold patterned fabric, with two chairs visible on the left side of the frame. A table is covered with a light-colored cloth, and part of a chandelier is visible above. A watermark for \"MOVIECLIPS.COM\" is present in the bottom left corner.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
