  "merged_caption": "The shot begins with a medium close-up of a man in clown makeup, with white face paint, black-ringed eyes, and a smeared red smile, positioned in the left foreground. He has greasy, shoulder-length dark hair with green tints and wears a dark purple suit jacket over a dark shirt and tie. The camera, positioned at eye level, performs a very smooth, counterclockwise arc around the man, who moves counterclockwise while maintaining eye contact with a woman. As the camera follows his movement, it brings the woman into the right side of the frame. She has brown hair styled in an updo and is wearing a dark green dress with short sleeves and embellished straps. The shot settles into a close-up that frames both subjects, with the man on the left and the woman on the right, both in the foreground, engaged in a face-to-face interaction. Throughout the scene, blurred figures of other guests in formal attire occupy the middle ground, indicating a formal gathering in a dimly lit room within a high-rise building. Large windows in the background provide a view of a dark city skyline punctuated by distant lights. The camera maintains a shallow depth of field, focusing on the two characters in the foreground, ensuring their faces remain in clear view as they maintain their respective positions on the left and right sides of the frame.",

    "Camera": "This eye-level, level-angle shot maintains a shallow depth of field, focusing on the two characters in the foreground. The camera performs a very smooth, counterclockwise arc around the man and woman.",
    "Subject": "A man with white clown makeup, black-ringed eyes, and a smeared red smile moves on the left, facing a woman on the right. The man has greasy, shoulder-length dark hair with green tints and wears a dark purple suit jacket over a dark shirt and tie. The woman has brown hair styled in an updo and is wearing a dark green dress with short sleeves and embellished straps. They are positioned close to one another, engaged in a face-to-face interaction, maintaining their respective positions on the left and right sides of the frame.",
    "Motion": "A man moves counterclockwise around a woman while maintaining eye contact with her, and she looks back at him. The camera consistently keeps both of their faces in clear view.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set at night within a dimly lit room in a high-rise building, where a formal gathering is taking place. Large windows in the background provide a view of a dark city skyline punctuated by distant lights. The interior is filled with numerous guests in formal attire, who appear as blurred figures in the background. In the foreground, a man wearing a purple jacket and a woman in a dark green dress stand close together, central to the surrounding social event.",
    "Spatial": "The shot begins with a medium close-up of a man in clown makeup positioned in the left foreground. The camera then arcs counterclockwise to the right, following the man's movement, which brings a woman into the right side of the frame. The shot settles into a close-up that frames both subjects, with the man on the left and the woman on the right, both in the foreground. Throughout the scene, blurred figures of other guests occupy the middle ground, and the lights of a city skyline are visible through windows in the deep background. The camera is positioned at the subjects' eye level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
