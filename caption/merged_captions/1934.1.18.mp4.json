  "merged_caption": "The video shows a medium shot of four individuals in white protective suits with hoods, gathered around a central screen. The camera captures them from the chest up, with three individuals facing away from the camera. Two are on the left side of the frame, and one is on the right, closely grouped together in the foreground. The fourth individual, wearing a red top hat, stands slightly apart and elevated toward the top right of the frame, positioned in the middle ground with his full upper body visible. The screen they are observing is centrally placed in the background, displaying a small white silhouette against a black backdrop. The shot size and spatial positioning remain consistent throughout the sequence, emphasizing the group's focus on the screen, while the individual in the red top hat maintains a distinct position within the scene. The video is shot at eye level with a level camera angle, featuring a shallow depth of field that focuses on the middle ground, and the camera remains completely static throughout. The screen shows a white silhouette of a person that raises its arms, waves them, and then lowers them. The individuals remain almost stationary, intently watching the screen with their backs to the camera. The video is set indoors in a white room with a minimalist design, dominated by a large, central monitor. The atmosphere is clinical and focused, with the group intently observing the screen. The lighting is bright and even, enhancing the clean and orderly appearance of the room. The scene conveys a sense of uniformity and attention among the group, with the person in the red top hat adding a splash of color to the otherwise monochromatic setting.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
