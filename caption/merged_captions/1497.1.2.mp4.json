  "merged_caption": "In a close-up shot, a light-skinned man's hand, wearing a black suit jacket and a white dress shirt with the cuff visible at his wrist, holds a small, folded piece of light green or grey paper between his thumb and index finger. The hand is positioned in the middle ground, with the man's arm extending from the center towards the left. The index finger gently presses down on the paper. Below the hand, dark, patterned upholstery occupies the bottom middle ground, while to the right, a light tan or beige tablecloth is visible in both the foreground and middle ground. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, starts from a high, hip-level angle and focuses on the hand in the midground, employing a shallow depth of field. It performs a smooth, minor zoom-in on the hand, enhancing the focus on the paper. The setting is moderately lit, and a \"MOVIECLIPS.COM\" watermark is present as an overlay in the bottom left corner.",

    "Scene": "In a moderately lit indoor setting, a person's hand holds a small, folded, light-green piece of paper. The individual, wearing a black suit jacket and a white cuffed shirt, is seated on furniture with dark, patterned upholstery. A light-colored beige tablecloth is visible to the right.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
