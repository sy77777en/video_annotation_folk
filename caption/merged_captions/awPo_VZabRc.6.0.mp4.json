  "merged_caption": "In a medium shot, a young woman with light skin and black hair styled in an updo, wearing a pink short-sleeved t-shirt and dark pants, is positioned in the middle ground, slightly left of center, as she walks steadily from left to right through a diner characterized by a muted color scheme of browns and grays. The camera smoothly tracks to the right, following her movement. In the foreground, the back of a man with reddish-brown hair in a red baseball cap and brown jacket occupies the bottom, and an older man with a prominent nose in a dark blue cap and grey jacket briefly appears to his right before exiting the frame. The main subject, carrying a light blue backpack over her right shoulder, passes in front of the man in the foreground, moving toward the right side of the frame. A tall blonde woman with long hair, wearing a light purple t-shirt and a white apron, walks in front of the woman with black hair, heading in the same direction. The scene is set in a diner with a service counter lined with stools in the background and booths with reddish-brown upholstered backs in the foreground and middle ground. Above the counter, a reddish-brown valance is marked with a repeating pattern of small black crosses, with one larger cross at the center. The space is illuminated by simple, spherical white light fixtures hanging from the ceiling, with unlit hanging light bulbs above the counter. On the table, there are three items: a salt shaker, a bottle of sauce, and a napkin holder. Upon reaching her assigned table, the blonde woman tosses the menu onto the table as she continues walking. The animated woman then lowers her backpack and places it on the seat next to her, and the camera pauses when she stops.",

Booths with reddish-brown upholstered backs are positioned in the foreground and middle ground.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
