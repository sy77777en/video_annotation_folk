  "merged_caption": "This wide shot captures a naval battle scene under a dark, overcast sky. A destroyer is positioned in the right middle ground, angled steeply with its bow lifted out of the water and pointing towards the upper center of the frame. Fires are visible on its superstructure, releasing plumes of black smoke as it lists at an extreme angle in the water. In the background, an aircraft carrier is visible in the center-right, and a smoking landmass with palm trees occupies the left side of the frame. The scene is framed with a dark, overcast sky occupying approximately the top quarter of the frame, while the sea covers the bottom three-quarters. The camera is positioned at a high angle, looking down at the overall scene. From a smooth, aerial high-angle perspective, the camera subtly dollies backward and pans left, expanding the view of the naval battle. The shot utilizes a deep focus, ensuring both the damaged ship in the middle ground and the aircraft carrier in the distance remain clear. In the distance, a coastline with palm trees and structures shows signs of smoke, while a gray aircraft carrier sits further out on the murky, greenish-blue water. The entire scene is reflected in the turbulent, gray-green water, suggesting a recent, large-scale battle. The video lacks a single main subject, as the composition emphasizes the vast, destructive scale and tense atmosphere of the entire battle scene rather than focusing on any individual vessel. The focus is on conveying the environmental chaos of the conflict.",

    "Subject": "This is a naval battle scenery shot depicting a chaotic engagement at sea under a dark, overcast sky. In the middle ground, a modern gray destroyer is seen at a dramatic angle, with flames and thick black smoke billowing from its superstructure. Further in the distance, the large silhouette of an aircraft carrier is visible through the haze, while on the left, a landmass with palm trees is also engulfed in smoke from fires.

    "Motion": "This is a wide shot of a dramatic and destructive naval scene. In the middle ground on the right side of the frame, a modern destroyer is heavily damaged, with fire and thick black smoke pouring from its superstructure as it lists at an extreme angle in the water. In the distance, an aircraft carrier and a smoking, palm-tree-lined landmass are visible under a dark, ominous, and cloudy sky, suggesting a recent, large-scale battle. The entire scene is reflected in the turbulent, gray-green water.",
    "Scene": "An outdoor scene unfolds across a large body of water under a dark, overcast sky thick with smoke. In the distance, a coastline with palm trees and structures shows signs of smoke, while a gray aircraft carrier sits further out on the murky, greenish-blue water. A gray naval destroyer prominently occupies the right side of the middle ground, angled steeply with its bow lifted out of the water. Fires are visible on its superstructure, releasing plumes of black smoke, and its exposed hull reveals propellers and a forward gun turret.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
