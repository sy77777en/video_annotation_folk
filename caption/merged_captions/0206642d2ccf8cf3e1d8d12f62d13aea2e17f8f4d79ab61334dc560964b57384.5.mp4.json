  "merged_caption": "The video features a close-up shot of a kitchen scene with a wooden cutting board prominently occupying approximately 70% of the frame, centrally positioned on a light-colored countertop. Sliced cucumbers are spread across the cutting board, with a knife featuring a white handle lying horizontally near the top edge. In the foreground, fresh vegetables such as green onions with white bulbs, leafy green lettuce, and two red tomatoes are arranged along the bottom edge of the frame. The background includes a small section of white cabinetry at the top of the frame. The camera remains stationary, positioned at eye level with a high angle, capturing the scene from above and employing deep focus to ensure all elements, including the cucumbers, knife, and surrounding vegetables, remain sharp and clear. A person moves from the left side of the frame to the right, partially visible in the background, and continues to move out of the frame, leaving the chopped cucumbers and the vegetables on the cutting board. The environment is well-lit, highlighting the natural colors and textures of the produce, creating a clean and organized culinary workspace. The arrangement suggests a food preparation scene with a focus on fresh produce.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
