  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium close-up shot of an East Asian man with a thin mustache and black hair styled away from his face, wearing a dark blue, round-collared tunic, positioned in the foreground at the center of the frame. He stands with a tense expression, looking forward and slightly to his right. Behind him, in the middle ground, are two East Asian men each holding the same straight, metallic sword horizontally across the scene, with the blade positioned behind the central man. The man immediately to the main subject's left holds the blade, while an older man to his right grips the hilt, indicating they are engaged in a fight. These men, along with two others visible in the background, are dressed in official-looking grey and black robes with distinctive black, boxy hats. The scene is set indoors within a dimly lit room with dark-colored walls, featuring a light-colored, repeating geometric meander pattern as a decorative border along the top of the wall. The camera, at eye-level and with a shallow depth of field, keeps the man in the foreground in focus as it smoothly dollies backward and pedestals upward, transitioning to a medium shot that reveals more of the subjects' torsos while they maintain their relative positions. As the camera moves, the man in the blue tunic takes a step forward, facing the same direction, and ascends a step. The other men in the scene remain stationary, with two standing in the background on the left and right sides of the frame. Throughout the shot, the camera remains at the subjects' level, capturing the dynamics and spatial relationships as the scene unfolds.",

    "Camera": "This is an eye-level, level-angle shot with a shallow depth of field that keeps the man in the foreground in focus. The camera smoothly dollies backward and pedestals upward, leading the man as he walks forward and ascends a step.",
    "Subject": "The main subject is an East Asian man with a thin mustache and black hair styled away from his face, wearing a dark blue, round-collared tunic. He stands in the center with a tense expression, looking forward and slightly to his right. He is surrounded by other East Asian men dressed in official-looking grey and black robes with distinctive black, boxy hats. The man immediately to the main subject's left is holding the other end of the sword, while an older man to his right holds the sword with the blade resting on his shoulder. Two men in similar attire are visible in the background.",
    "Motion": "The man in the blue tunic takes a step forward, facing the same direction as the camera moves backward and pans to the left. Behind him and to the left of the frame, a man holds the blade of a sword, while another man on the right side of the frame grips the hilt, indicating they are engaged in a fight. The other men in the scene remain stationary.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set indoors within a dimly lit room with dark-colored walls. A light-colored, repeating geometric meander pattern is visible as a decorative border along the top of the wall in the background. A man in a simple, dark blue tunic stands in the center, surrounded by several other men dressed in grey and black period uniforms accented with yellow fabric. These uniformed men wear tall, black, rectangular hats. A straight, metallic sword is held horizontally in the scene, its blade positioned behind the central man.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium close-up shot of a man positioned in the foreground at the center of the frame. Behind him, in the middle ground, are two men each holding the same sword horizontally across the scene, with the blade positioned behind the central man. One man is on the left and the other on the right. Two other men stand in the background on the left and right sides of the frame. The camera then pulls back, transitioning to a medium shot that reveals more of the subjects' torsos while they maintain their relative positions. Throughout the shot, the camera remains at the subjects' level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
