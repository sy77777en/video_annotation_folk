  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a medium close-up of a man with short, messy brown hair energetically playing a drum set in the center foreground, wearing a light blue blazer over a white hoodie with \"HELLBOY\" printed in red letters within a red outlined box on the chest. A golden-bronze cymbal marked \"PAISTE\" is to his left. The scene unfolds on an urban rooftop beneath a grey, overcast sky, with a sprawling cityscape and a distinct tower in the background. A dark brick wall is visible in the middle ground. The camera, positioned at eye level, rotates counterclockwise around the man, maintaining him as the focal point with a shallow focus that keeps him sharp while the background is blurred. The camera movement is unsteady, with noticeable shaking. The man plays the drums with remarkable energy, dynamically moving his head and upper body in rhythm, occasionally raising both hands high for powerful strikes and leaning forward while turning his head from side to side. The shot transitions to a medium shot, revealing more of the drum set with cymbals on both sides, as the camera pans slightly, following the man's movements as he shifts within the center foreground. The cityscape remains in the background, and the brick wall is in the middle ground. Finally, the shot returns to a medium close-up, with the man in the center foreground, sometimes slightly to the right, and the \"PAISTE\" cymbal prominent in the left foreground, while the cityscape, including a distant tower, occupies the background. The man is shown shouting with an intense expression as he plays with drumsticks, and parts of the drum set, including golden-bronze colored cymbals, are visible.",

    "Camera": "The camera is at eye level and maintains a level angle, arcing counterclockwise around the man playing the drums. The focus is shallow, keeping the man in the foreground sharp while the background is blurred. The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.",
    "Subject": "A man with short, messy brown hair is energetically playing a drum set. He is wearing a light blue blazer over a white hoodie; the hoodie has the word \"HELLBOY\" printed in red letters within a red outlined box on the chest. He is shown shouting with an intense expression as he plays with drumsticks. Parts of the drum set are visible, including golden-bronze colored cymbals; one larger cymbal has \"PAISTE\" written on it in black lettering.",
    "Motion": "A man plays the drums with remarkable energy, dynamically moving his head and upper body in rhythm. He occasionally raises both hands high for powerful strikes, while at other times, he brings one hand down with force. His vigorous movements include leaning forward and turning his head from side to side as he continues to play with intensity.",
    "Scene": "The video unfolds on an urban rooftop beneath a grey, overcast sky. A sprawling cityscape, characterized by buildings of various heights and a distinct tower in the distance, forms the backdrop. A low, dark brick wall lines part of the rooftop, and metallic drum cymbals, one notably larger with \"PAISTE\" markings, are prominent elements within this setting.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a medium close-up of a man in the center foreground, with a golden-bronze cymbal marked \"PAISTE\" to his left. A dark brick wall is visible in the middle ground, and a cityscape forms the background. The camera rotates counterclockwise, maintaining the man as the focal point, but there is noticeable instability, causing the frame to shift. The shot transitions to a medium shot, revealing more of the drum set with cymbals on both sides. The cityscape remains in the background, and the brick wall is in the middle ground. The camera pans slightly, following the man's movements as he shifts within the center foreground. Finally, the shot returns to a medium close-up, with the man in the center foreground, sometimes slightly to the right, and the \"PAISTE\" cymbal prominent in the left foreground, while the cityscape, including a distant tower, occupies the background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
