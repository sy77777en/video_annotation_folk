  "merged_caption": "This wide scenery shot captures a bustling European square using a time-lapse effect, which blurs the numerous people moving through the foreground and middle ground into streaks of motion. Initially, the scene is framed by a large, white building on the left and another in the background, with a prominent bronze monument situated in the center middle ground. The camera maintains a deep focus, ensuring that both the people in the foreground and the historic buildings in the background remain sharp. The camera then performs a slow pan from left to right while simultaneously moving to the left, gradually revealing more of an ornate, white building on the right. This movement causes the building on the left to move out of the frame while revealing more of the architecture on the right side of the frame. Throughout the pan, the central monument remains in the center of the frame. The scene is set in the In der Burg courtyard of the Hofburg Palace in Vienna, Austria, on a sunny day under a clear blue sky. The expansive, paved square is framed by grand, historic buildings with off-white facades, dark roofs, and green copper accents. A large, dark bronze monument with a standing figure on an ornate pedestal stands in the center, dedicated to Emperor Francis I. The time-lapse effect shows crowds of people as blurred motion, bustling through the sunny square, along with a horse-drawn carriage, creating streaks of activity across the courtyard. The camera is positioned at eye level, capturing the grand palace buildings and the central monument, emphasizing the magnificent scale of the surrounding historical architecture and the overall bustling atmosphere.",

    "Subject": "This video presents a time-lapse cityscape scenery shot of a grand, sun-drenched European square. The scene is framed by large, ornate white buildings with brown and green-accented roofs, all under a clear blue sky. At the heart of the cobblestone square stands a prominent, dark bronze monument featuring a central figure on a high pedestal. There is no single main subject, as the time-lapse technique blurs the numerous people walking through the square into streams of motion. This effect intentionally shifts the focus from individuals to the overall bustling atmosphere and the magnificent scale of the surrounding historical architecture.",

A large, dark bronze monument with a standing figure on an ornate pedestal stands in the center. The movement of numerous pedestrians and a horse-drawn carriage appears as motion blurs, creating streaks of activity across the courtyard as the camera pans slowly from left to right.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
