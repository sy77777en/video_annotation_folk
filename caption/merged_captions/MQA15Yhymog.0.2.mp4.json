  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a woman's lower body, positioned in the center of the frame as she stands on a red surfboard in the foreground. Her tanned legs and lower torso are visible, with a yellow bikini bottom and a dark top. Her bare feet are planted on the board's textured surface, with a black logo centered beneath them. The surfboard occupies the bottom of the frame, with a breaking wave visible in the middle ground on the right, set against a sunny sky and mountains along the shoreline in the background. The camera, mounted on the surfboard, provides a low-angle perspective and exhibits mild barrel distortion, using deep focus to keep the scene sharp. As the woman stands with her knees bent, balancing as the board glides through the water, she takes several steps backward, starting with her right foot, to adjust her stance. This movement causes the framing to transition into a full shot that captures her entire body. In this new composition, she remains in the center but is now positioned further back in the middle ground, with the surfboard's logo now visible in the foreground in front of her. The camera moves backward with the board, causing the surfer to appear smaller in the frame. The orientation is unstable, with a varying Dutch angle created by it rolling slightly clockwise, then counterclockwise, and finally clockwise again. As the board continues to ride a wave, water splashes over her feet, and white sea spray and foam splash over the board's surface. To the right, a green-blue wave with a white crest is breaking, enhancing the dynamic ocean environment captured in this unsteady, shaky shot.",

    "Camera": "This unsteady, shaky shot is filmed from a camera mounted on a surfboard, capturing the surfer from a low angle. The video exhibits mild barrel distortion and uses a deep focus to keep the scene sharp. Positioned above the water, the camera moves backward as the surfer rides, causing the surfer to appear smaller in the frame. The camera's orientation is unstable, with a varying Dutch angle created by it rolling slightly clockwise, then counterclockwise, and finally clockwise again.",
    "Subject": "From a low-angle perspective on a surfboard, the tanned legs and lower torso of a woman are initially visible as she stands on the board. She is wearing a yellow bikini bottom and a dark top. Her bare feet are planted on the red surface of the surfboard, with a black logo beneath them. As she moves backward on the board, her entire body comes into view, and the logo shifts to appear in front of her.",
    "Motion": "From a low-angle view on a surfboard, a woman stands with her knees bent, balancing as the board glides through the water. She then takes several steps backward, starting with her right foot, to adjust her stance on the board as it continues to ride a wave, with water splashing over her feet.",
    "Scene": "A locked-on POV shot from a camera mounted on a red surfboard captures the experience of riding on the ocean under a bright, sunny sky. Initially, only a person's wet legs and feet are visible standing on the board. As she steps backward, her entire body comes into view. The board, which has a black logo near its center, moves through the water as white sea spray and foam splash over its textured surface. To the right, a green-blue wave with a white crest is breaking.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a woman's lower body, positioned in the center of the frame as she stands on a red surfboard in the foreground. The surfboard occupies the bottom of the frame, with a black logo centered beneath her feet. A breaking wave is visible in the middle ground on the right, set against a sunny sky and mountains along the shoreline in the background.

In this new composition, she remains in the center but is now positioned further back in the middle ground, with the surfboard's logo now visible in the foreground in front of her. The camera is positioned at the subject's level on the surfboard, providing a low-angle perspective as it moves with the board."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
