  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a level-angle full shot, where a large, three-headed, wolf-like creature composed of geometric shapes in light blue, blue-violet, and white dominates the foreground, nearly filling the entire screen. The camera tilts up to a low angle and moves forward to track the creature as it leaps into the air, then tilts back down to a level angle as it lands. Initially, two tall, glowing pillars are positioned in the middle ground, but they shift to the foreground and eventually exit the frame as the camera advances. The scene transitions into a wide tracking shot, revealing a humanoid character wearing a blue jacket and dark pants on a futuristic light green-cyan motorcycle in the foreground, moving forward along a path. The three-headed creature is now in the center of the frame in the middle ground, moving away from the rider. The creature launches five blue missiles with red flames trailing from their tails toward the rider. Simultaneously, three circular, spiky obstacles roll toward the rider consecutively from the front. The rider continues to drive forward, navigating between the rolling obstacles. The scene is set in a stylized, dark forest at night, rendered in a low-poly aesthetic with a color palette that shifts between deep blues and teals to a vibrant, saturated magenta. Tall, angular trees with glowing, stylized leaves line the dark path, where small, glowing lanterns hang from strings between the trees. The air is filled with floating, glowing, stylized leaf-like shapes. A score display remains fixed in the top left corner of the frame, transitioning from purple with a flickering effect to a dynamically changing mix of purple, yellow, green, and other colors. The camera follows the rider from behind at the subject's level, maintaining a deep focus on the entire stylized environment.",

    "Camera": "This video game footage is captured from a slightly unsteady tail-tracking shot, positioned at an overhead, second-floor height. The camera follows a biker character pursuing a massive three-headed dog. Initially, the camera starts at a level angle, tilts to a low angle to track the dog's large leap, and then returns to a level angle before transitioning to a steady forward motion. A deep focus keeps the entire stylized environment sharp.",
    "Subject": "In a stylized, low-poly world, a humanoid character wearing a blue jacket and dark pants rides a futuristic motorcycle of a light green-cyan color. This character is positioned behind and faces a large, quadrupedal, three-headed, wolf-like creature composed of geometric shapes in light blue, blue-violet, and white, with the entire head glowing. At one point, a red, circular indicator appears when the creature launches a small missile. Light blue, circular, spiky obstacles also appear on the path in front of the rider. The scene's color palette shifts between dark blue and vibrant magenta, but these changes do not alter the appearance of the subjects.",
    "Motion": "A large, three-headed creature leaps into the air before descending. The scene then cuts to a character on a motorcycle riding forward on a path, following the creature, which also moves forward. The creature launches five blue missiles with red flames trailing from their tails toward the rider. Simultaneously, three circular, spiky obstacles roll toward the rider consecutively from the front. The rider continues to drive forward, navigating between the rolling obstacles.",
    "Scene": "A third-person 3D game video takes place in a stylized, dark forest at night. The scene is rendered in a low-poly aesthetic, with a color palette that shifts between deep blues and teals to a vibrant, saturated magenta. Tall, angular trees with glowing, stylized leaves line a dark path, where small, glowing lanterns hang from strings between the trees. A large, light blue, multi-headed, wolf-like creature with glowing heads moves along the path. The air is filled with floating, glowing, stylized leaf-like shapes. An overlay in the top left corner displays a changing score in a digital font, transitioning from purple with a flickering effect to a dynamically changing mix of purple, yellow, green, and other colors.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a level-angle full shot, where a large, three-headed creature dominates the foreground, nearly filling the entire screen.

Initially, two tall, glowing pillars are positioned in the middle ground, but they shift to the foreground and eventually exit the frame as the camera advances. The scene transitions into a wide tracking shot, revealing a character on a motorcycle in the foreground, moving forward along a path.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
