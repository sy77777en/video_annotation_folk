  "merged_caption": "In a full shot, two women are positioned on a hazy field at night, illuminated from an unseen source. The ground is a flat, uniform surface. A woman in a dark blue jersey with the number 7, dark shorts, and blue socks occupies the left middle ground, seen from behind. A second woman in a light-colored, possibly white, jersey and shorts with the number 10 and red socks is in the right middle ground, facing the first. Her hair is tied back in a ponytail. The background is dark and indistinct. Both figures are blurred by motion, captured mid-action. The camera captures the scene from an eye-level angle with deep focus, but its unsteady motion and noticeable shaking make it challenging to maintain a clear view, especially when tracking the girl dribbling a ball. A soccer player in a light-colored jersey moves rapidly from right to left across the hazy field, maneuvering past a second player in a dark jersey who stands in a defensive position. The player in the light jersey's body is angled as if controlling a ball at her feet.",

    "Scene": "An outdoor field at night is illuminated from an unseen source. The ground is a flat, uniform surface. Two figures are visible in motion, their forms blurred. One figure, positioned on the left, wears dark clothing, while the other, on the right, is in a lighter-colored outfit. The background is obscured by the darkness.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
