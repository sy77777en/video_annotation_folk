  "merged_caption": "This extreme wide shot, captured from a high angle, initially frames a small character resembling a blue penguin wearing a red scarf in the middle ground, positioned slightly to the right of the frame's center on a winding, snowy mountain path. The large, purple mountain, covered in patches of white snow and dotted with small, green, pixelated pine trees, dominates the scene, positioned centrally. White, pixelated snowflakes fall continuously across the landscape. Overlay elements, including a row of four yellow feathers next to five light-blue feathers in the bottom-left corner and a small compass with a red needle pointing north in the top-right, are visible throughout the shot. As the character walks steadily up the path toward the upper-right, the camera smoothly arcs counterclockwise around the mountain, dynamically adjusting its distance to maintain focus on the character's movement. Midway through, the camera quickly zooms in as the character nears another figure and then zooms back out as they move past. The character's position remains consistently in the center-right of the frame, while the overlays stay fixed in their respective corners. As the video progresses, the yellow feathers in the user interface gradually change to blue from left to right, indicating a change in status. The scene is set in a third-person 3D game video with a pixelated art style during the day, enhancing the visual appeal of the snowy mountain environment.",

    "Camera": "From a high, aerial angle, the camera smoothly tracks a character climbing a snowy mountain. It executes a continuous counterclockwise arc around the mountain. Midway through, the camera quickly zooms in as the character nears another figure and then zooms back out as they move past.",
    "Subject": "In a pixel art style, a small character resembling a blue penguin wearing a red scarf stands on a snowy path winding up a large, purple, rocky mountain. The mountain is covered in patches of white snow, with a few small, green, pixelated pine trees dotted along its ledges. In the bottom-left corner, a user interface initially displays a row of four yellow feathers next to five light-blue feathers. As the video progresses, the yellow feathers gradually change to blue from left to right. A small compass with a red needle pointing north is located in the top-right corner.",
    "Motion": "A small, pixelated character walks steadily up a winding, snowy path on the side of a large, purple mountain. The camera moves in a counterclockwise arc around the mountain, tracking the character's ascent along the trail.",
    "Scene": "In a third-person 3D game video with a pixelated art style, the scene is set on a steep, snowy mountain during the day. The mountain face is a distinct purple color, with white snow covering various ledges and winding paths where a few small, green pine trees grow. White, pixelated snowflakes fall continuously across the landscape as a small character navigates a path up the side of the cliff. An overlay in the bottom-left corner displays a heads-up display with a row of four golden and five blue feather icons. In the top-right corner, another overlay shows a small compass with a red needle.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
