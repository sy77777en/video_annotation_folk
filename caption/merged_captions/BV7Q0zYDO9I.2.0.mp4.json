  "merged_caption": "This wide shot captures a slow, dynamic scene set in a dimly lit, undefined space. In the left foreground stands a blue toy soldier, mirrored by another in the right foreground. Both are dressed in helmets and tactical vests, holding brown rifles aimed at the center. The middle ground, centrally illuminated by a spotlight, features two white toy figures kneeling side-by-side, one slightly left of center and the other slightly right of center, with their hands raised above their heads. Several small, white, cylindrical objects are scattered on the ground in the center of the middle ground, in front of and between the kneeling figures. The surrounding background is completely black. The camera starts at hip level and moves to eye level, initially at the subjects' level, then moves forward and upward, eventually positioning itself above the subjects. Its angle shifts from level to a high angle as it moves forward and tilts down. A shallow depth of field is employed, with focus on the midground figures, maintained by focus tracking. The camera movement is very smooth. The two blue toy soldier figures are slowly moving forward on either side of the kneeling figures, maintaining their aim at the center. An overlay text \"[23]\" is located in the lower left corner.",

    "Subject": "The video displays a dimly lit scene with a spotlight focused on the center. In the foreground, on the left, a blue toy soldier figure stands slightly turned towards the midground, wearing a helmet and tactical vest, and aiming a brown rifle towards the center. On the right, another blue toy soldier figure is similarly positioned, slightly turned towards the midground, also in a helmet and tactical vest, aiming a brown rifle towards the center. In the middle ground, two white toy figures of men are kneeling side-by-side, facing forward with their hands raised above their heads. Both kneeling figures are dressed in white suits. Several small, white, cylindrical objects are scattered on the ground in front of and between the kneeling figures.",
    "Motion": "The scene is set in a dark environment with a spotlight illuminating the central area. Two blue toy soldier figures, dressed in helmets and tactical vests, are slowly moving forward on either side of the kneeling figures, each holding a brown rifle aimed at the center. The kneeling figures, dressed in white suits, have their hands raised above their heads. Scattered on the ground in front of and between the kneeling figures are several small, white, cylindrical objects. The camera gradually moves closer to the scene, maintaining focus on the central area where the kneeling figures and the advancing blue toy soldiers are located.",
    "Scene": "The video depicts a static scene set in a dimly lit, undefined space, where a large spotlight illuminates a flat, gray, textured ground. In the illuminated center, two small, white, matte-finished figurines of men in suits are kneeling with their hands raised, with several smaller, white, cylindrical and rectangular objects scattered near them. Flanking these central figures are two larger, blue, matte-finished figurines resembling soldiers in tactical gear and helmets, each holding a brown rifle aimed towards the kneeling white figures. The surrounding area and background are completely black. An overlay text \"[23]\" is located in the lower left corner.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
