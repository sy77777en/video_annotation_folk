  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a wide, low-angle view capturing a bustling scene of pedestrians and tourists along the road in the foreground and middle ground, their motion resembling the accelerated rhythm of a time-lapse. Historic buildings fill the frame, with an exquisite white marble facade prominently positioned in the center. On the left, a dark brown building contrasts with an off-white building on the right, which is shrouded in shadow and extends from the foreground to the middle ground. Large, ribbed domes, situated in the middle ground, rise against a backdrop of a clear, deep blue sky at the top of the frame. The architecture is intricate, featuring Gothic spires, arches, and numerous statues. One of the domes is conspicuously encased in scaffolding, indicating ongoing restoration work. The camera executes a very smooth, complex movement, simultaneously zooming in, tilting up, moving left, and panning right, maintaining a wide perspective throughout. This movement focuses on the elaborate details of the roofline and domes, highlighting the ornate pinnacles and statues atop the central facade. The bright sunlight casts distinct shadows, emphasizing the detailed carvings and textures of the buildings. The shot uses a deep focus, keeping the entire building in sharp detail, as the view slowly zooms in to highlight the detailed stonework and statuary crowning the central section. The scene captures the architectural grandeur of a historic European building, likely a cathedral or palace, set against a brilliant blue sky, with the focus on the impressive scale and intricate details of the environment itself.",

    "Camera": "This is a time-lapse video of an ornate building, filmed from a low-angle, eye-level perspective. The camera executes a very smooth, complex movement, simultaneously zooming in, tilting up, moving left, and panning right. The shot uses a deep focus, keeping the entire building in sharp detail.",
    "Subject": "This cityscape scenery shot captures the architectural grandeur of a historic European building, with numerous pedestrians and tourists visible on the road at the bottom of the frame. The focus is on the impressive scale and intricate details of the environment itself. The building, set against a cloudless, deep blue sky, features multiple weathered grey domes and elaborate white marble facades adorned with gothic arches, pinnacles, and numerous statues. One of the domes is conspicuously encased in scaffolding, indicating ongoing restoration work, while the view slowly zooms in to highlight the detailed stonework and statuary crowning the central section.",
    "Motion": "This video begins with a bustling crowd of pedestrians and tourists in the lower part of the frame, captured in a time-lapse style that creates a dynamic and rhythmic visual effect. Above them, the camera reveals the upper portion of a grand, historic building, likely a cathedral or palace, set against a brilliant blue sky. The architecture is intricate, featuring large, weathered domes, white marble spires adorned with statues, and detailed carvings. One of the domes is noticeably covered in scaffolding, indicating restoration is underway. The camera performs a slow zoom and slight upward tilt, focusing on the elaborate details of the roofline and domes.",
    "Scene": "An outdoor, daytime view captures the intricate architecture of historic buildings in Venice against a clear, deep blue sky. The scene focuses on the upper portions of the structures, revealing a white marble facade adorned with Gothic spires, arches, and numerous statues. Several large, ribbed domes topped with crosses rise behind the facade, with one dome completely encased in metal scaffolding, contrasting with the adjacent ornate stonework and a section of warm-toned brick wall with a round window. Below, groups of pedestrians and tourists move continuously across the square, their motion resembling the accelerated rhythm of a time-lapse. The bright sunlight casts distinct shadows, highlighting the detailed carvings and textures of the buildings.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
