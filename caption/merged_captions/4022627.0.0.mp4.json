  "merged_caption": "In this close-up, top-down shot, a collection of dried banana chips is scattered and stacked randomly on a light wooden surface. The chips are thin, ranging from circular to oval in shape, with colors varying from light yellow to pale beige. Each piece features a darker, brownish, textured center, indicative of where the seeds were, and some chips also have darker yellow centers around their seeds. The chips are piled together, creating a textured surface, with some pieces slightly curled or broken. The chips are not evenly spaced, creating a natural, unstructured arrangement. The light wooden surface beneath the chips is visible in a few areas. The camera is positioned directly above the scene and smoothly rolls clockwise, maintaining a deep focus to ensure all the chips are clearly visible. This movement creates the illusion that the entire pile of chips is rotating counterclockwise.",

    "Camera": "From a bird's-eye view, the camera smoothly rolls clockwise over a pile of dried banana chips. The shot maintains a deep focus, ensuring all the chips are clearly visible.",
    "Subject": "A multitude of dried banana chips are shown in a close-up, top-down view. The chips are thin, circular to oval slices, with a light yellow to pale beige color. The chips feature slightly darker, brownish, and somewhat textured centers, indicative of where the seeds were, and some chips also feature darker yellow centers around their seeds. The chips are piled together, creating a textured surface, with some pieces slightly curled or broken. The light wooden surface beneath the chips is visible in a few areas. The camera rotates slowly in a clockwise direction, creating the illusion that the chips are moving counterclockwise in circles.",
    "Motion": "The camera captures a bird's-eye view of a pile of dried banana chips spread out motionless on a light wooden surface, then slowly rotates clockwise, creating the illusion that the banana chips are rotating counterclockwise.",
    "Scene": "A top-down, close-up shot shows a pile of dried banana chips on a light-colored wooden surface. The chips are thin, ranging from round to oval in shape, with colors varying from light yellow to light beige, and each piece has a darker, brownish, textured center.",
    "Spatial": "In this close-up, top-down shot, a collection of dried banana chips is scattered and stacked randomly on a light wooden surface. The chips are not evenly spaced, creating a natural, unstructured arrangement. The camera is positioned directly above the scene and rotates slowly in a clockwise direction, giving the visual impression of the entire pile of chips rotating counter-clockwise."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
