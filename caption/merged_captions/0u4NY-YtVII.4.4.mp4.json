  "merged_caption": "The video begins with an abstract shot of a world map, featuring continents in dark gray against a lighter gray background. Various locations in North America and South America are initially marked with blue squares in the top left and bottom left areas of the screen, drawing immediate attention. The blue squares then disappear, and a yellow curved line starts to form, originating from the middle right section of the map in Europe and extending across the Atlantic Ocean towards South America, creating a visual connection between the two continents. The camera, initially stationary, smoothly zooms in with a slight downward tilt, centering on Uruguay, located in the bottom left area of the frame. Uruguay is highlighted in light blue and labeled with white text, now occupying the central area. The surrounding countries remain in dark gray. The video concludes with a clear view of Uruguay, emphasizing the connection between Europe and Uruguay through the yellow line. Throughout the video, the camera maintains a top-down perspective, providing a clear overview of the geographical connections and transitions. In the lower-left corner, the text reads: \"[17]; © OpenStreetMap contributors © CARTO.\" The map's design uses dark tones for continents, drawing attention to the specified regions and routes. The minimalistic style uses clean lines and contrasting colors to convey information effectively. The video maintains an objective perspective, focusing on geographical representation and connections without indicating time of day or weather conditions.",

    "Camera": "The video begins with a stationary camera focusing on a world map. It then smoothly zooms in with a slight downward tilt, centering on Uruguay. The camera movement is very smooth, with no shaking.",
    "Subject": "The video presents a world map with various regions highlighted. Initially, several locations across North America and South America are marked with blue squares. A yellow curved line then appears, directly connecting a point in Europe to Uruguay, crossing the Atlantic Ocean. The focus shifts to Uruguay, where the country is distinctly highlighted in light blue and labeled with white text. This sequence suggests a journey or connection between Europe and Uruguay. The map's design uses dark tones for continents, drawing attention to the specified regions and routes.",
    "Motion": "The video begins with a world map where several locations in North America and South America are highlighted with blue squares. The blue squares then disappear, and a yellow curved line starts to form, connecting a point in Europe to Uruguay. The yellow line continues to extend, eventually reaching Uruguay, which is highlighted in light blue and labeled with white text. The video concludes with a clear view of Uruguay, emphasizing the connection between Europe and Uruguay through the yellow line.",
    "Scene": "The video begins with a light gray world map, featuring dark gray continents and light gray country borders. In the lower-left corner, the text reads: \"[17]; © OpenStreetMap contributors © CARTO.\" Initially, the map highlights the Americas, Europe, and Africa with moving blue squares that disappear. An orange line originates from Europe, connecting to Uruguay, which is highlighted in light blue with its name displayed. The video maintains an objective perspective, focusing on geographical representation and connections without indicating time of day or weather conditions. The minimalistic style uses clean lines and contrasting colors to convey information effectively.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with an abstract shot of a world map, featuring continents in dark gray against a lighter gray background. Various locations in North America and South America are initially marked with blue squares in the top left and bottom left areas of the screen, drawing immediate attention. As the video progresses, a yellow curved line emerges from the middle right section of the map, originating from Europe and extending across the Atlantic Ocean towards South America, creating a visual connection between the two continents. The camera then transitions smoothly, focusing on Uruguay, located in the bottom left area of the frame. Uruguay is highlighted in light blue and labeled with white text, now occupying the central area. The surrounding countries remain in dark gray.

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
