  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a person with dark, possibly braided or dreadlocked hair, dressed in dark clothing, upright on a vertical pole. The lower half of their body is obscured by their upper body, making it not visible. A prominent yellow-orange flame effect is positioned in the center of the frame, dynamically flowing around their arm and torso. The person remains stationary, bending at the waist in a forward-leaning posture, with their hands suspended in the air, not holding onto the pole. The camera cranes up in an arc, starting from a high angle and transitioning to a bird’s-eye view. It then rotates to an upside-down level angle, followed by an upside-down low angle, a worm’s-eye angle, and finally ends at a low angle. Throughout this sequence, the fiery light effect interacts with the central pole and the person's body. The scene is set indoors with dim, warm lighting, and the background is indistinct, showing a wall in soft focus. The entire scene is presented with a low-resolution, analog video quality, characterized by visible scan lines and a hazy, warm color palette, and is framed by black bars on the left and right. The camera captures the scene with deep focus and a large depth of field, providing a comprehensive view of the dynamic interaction between the light effect and the performer.",

    "Camera": "The unsteady camera cranes up in an arc around a performer. The shot begins at an overhead level with a high angle, transitions to a bird’s eye view, and then cranes upward through a complex sequence of angles—including an upside-down level angle, an upside-down low angle, and a worm’s eye angle—before settling at a low angle in the end. The entire scene is captured with a deep focus and a large depth of field.",
    "Subject": "A person with dark, possibly braided or dreadlocked hair is shown upright on a vertical pole, dressed in dark clothing. They remain stationary as a bright, fiery, yellow-orange light effect dynamically flows around their arm and torso.",
    "Motion": "A person on a vertical pole bends at the waist, maintaining a forward-leaning posture while remaining stationary, as the camera's perspective shifts to capture their poised position.",
    "Scene": "In an indoor setting with dim, warm lighting, a silhouetted figure is suspended motionless on a central vertical pole. A bright, yellow-orange, flame-like light effect flickers and moves along the pole. The background is indistinct, showing a wall in soft focus. The entire scene is presented with a low-resolution, analog video quality, characterized by visible scan lines and a hazy, warm color palette, and is framed by black bars on the left and right.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a full shot, although the lower half of the person's body is obscured by their upper body, making it not visible. A prominent yellow-orange flame effect is positioned in the center of the frame. The person remains upright, with their hands suspended in the air, not holding onto the vertical pole. The camera moves upward in an arc, starting from a high angle and transitioning to a bird’s-eye view as it moves on the crane. It then rotates to an upside-down level angle, followed by an upside-down low angle, a worm’s-eye angle, and finally ends at a low angle. Throughout this sequence, the fiery light effect dynamically interacts with the central pole and the person's body, while the background is captured with deep focus."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
