  "merged_caption": "In a dynamic extreme wide shot, the camera smoothly moves from left to right while simultaneously panning left, maintaining a stable composition focused on three men positioned as a group slightly left of center in the middle ground. The man on the left wears a blue short-sleeved shirt and yellow shorts, the man in the center is dressed in a dark green long-sleeved shirt and red shorts, and the man on the right wears a dark long-sleeved top, dark pants, and a light-colored head covering. They stand on the crest of a large, red sand dune that dominates the foreground and middle ground, sloping down from the upper left towards the bottom of the frame. The three people walk forward on the crest of the large, red sand dune, facing slightly to their right. In the background, a vast range of rugged, layered mountains extends across the scene, with a hazy sky visible at the top. The video, filmed by a drone, captures a wide, static view of the Wadi Rum desert in Jordan during the day. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping both the three people on the sand dune and the distant rock formations sharp. Their long shadows are cast across the smooth surface of the sand. In the background, a vast expanse of rugged, layered sandstone mountains and cliffs rises under a pale blue, hazy sky, creating a dramatic and expansive landscape. The camera slowly trucks from left to right while panning left, maintaining a steady composition on the people.",

    "Scene": "A video filmed by a drone captures a wide, static view of the Wadi Rum desert in Jordan during the day. In the foreground, a large dune of fine, reddish-orange sand slopes downward, its crest marked by the footprints of three people standing near the top. Their long shadows are cast across the smooth surface of the sand. In the background, a vast expanse of rugged, layered sandstone mountains and cliffs rises under a pale blue, hazy sky, creating a dramatic and expansive landscape.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
