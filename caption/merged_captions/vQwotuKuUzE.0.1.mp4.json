  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a Black man in the left foreground, positioned in profile and facing toward the right side of the frame. He has short, dark hair, a dark goatee, and a serious expression with his mouth slightly open. He is wearing a dark shirt and has a clear, coiled earpiece in his right ear, with the wire running down his neck. A strap is visible around his neck. The background consists of brightly lit, out-of-focus architectural shapes, suggesting a cityscape or a view from under a large bridge, which is briefly visible through its columns and overhang. The lighting is dramatic, casting most of his face in shadow while highlighting the contours of his profile. The camera performs a smooth, counterclockwise arc around him, maintaining an eye-level, level-angle shot with a shallow depth of field that keeps the man in the foreground in sharp focus. As the shot progresses, the camera movement causes his face to turn slightly toward the camera into a three-quarter view. During this camera movement, a second Black man, also wearing dark clothing and what appears to be an earpiece, becomes briefly visible in the middleground, initially appearing from the left and shifting towards the center of the frame, directly behind the first man. Approximately two seconds into the video, the first man lowers a cell phone from his left ear, and toward the end of the video, he turns his head to the left, appearing to prepare to speak to the second man, who remains mostly stationary. The camera remains at the first man's eye level throughout the shot, capturing the dynamic lighting that keeps half of his face in shadow and the other half illuminated.",

    "Motion": "A man, shown in a close-up profile, holds a cell phone to his left ear and speaks into it. Approximately two seconds into the video, he lowers the phone. Toward the end of the video, he turns his head to the left, appearing to prepare to speak to a second man briefly visible behind him, who remains mostly stationary.",
    "Scene": "An outdoor scene is depicted with strong backlighting, creating a high-contrast visual. The background is a bright, out-of-focus expanse of white and pale blue, punctuated by large, indistinct architectural forms, suggesting a cityscape or a view from under a large bridge, which is briefly visible through its columns and overhang. The foreground prominently features the main subject, with dynamic lighting that keeps half of his face in shadow and the other half illuminated. A clear, coiled wire of an earpiece is discernible near the person's ear and neck. The camera's position shifts slightly, arcing counterclockwise around the man, allowing different parts of his face to become visible in the lighting.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a man in the left foreground, positioned in profile and facing toward the right side of the frame. The background consists of brightly lit, out-of-focus architectural shapes. As the shot progresses, the camera slowly arcs counter-clockwise around the first man, causing his face to turn slightly toward the camera into a three-quarter view. During this camera movement, a second man becomes briefly visible in the middleground, initially appearing from the left and shifting towards the center of the frame, directly behind the first man. The camera remains at the first man's eye level throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
