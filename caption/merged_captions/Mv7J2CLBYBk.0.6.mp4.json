  "merged_caption": "This is a wide shot filmed at the subjects' level, capturing a spacious, modern indoor hall with white paneled walls and a highly reflective, glossy gray floor. A golf cart with a driver is moving rightwards in the left-middle ground of the frame. The cart is white and black with black seats and a gray and red logo on its side featuring the letter \"M\" and a star-like symbol. In the driver's seat is a woman with long brown hair tied back, wearing a white long-sleeved shirt and dark pants, holding the steering wheel. In front of the golf cart, a man dressed in a black jacket, black pants, and a gray baseball cap is initially seen mid-air in the center of the frame, also in the middle ground. The man executes an acrobatic side flip in mid-air, moving in an arc upwards and to the right, landing on the reflective floor and stumbling as he rolls over. Initially facing the camera, he turns to the right of the frame and then faces left, moving backward a few steps to avoid being hit by the golf cart. Although the golf cart appears stationary on the left throughout the clip, it is actually moving rightwards, with the camera tracking its motion. The highly reflective floor in the foreground mirrors the moving cart and the man's entire acrobatic motion. From a level angle, ground-level perspective, the shot maintains a deep focus. The unsteady camera tracks rightward, following the man as he performs an acrobatic flip over the moving golf cart. The area is illuminated by natural sunlight streaming in from the side, and in the background, a white door and a set of double doors with glass panels are visible.",

    "Subject": "A man dressed in a black jacket, black pants, and a gray baseball cap performs an acrobatic flip in the air, landing on the shiny, reflective light-gray floor. In the driver's seat of a white and black golf cart is a woman with long brown hair tied back, wearing a white long-sleeved shirt and dark pants, holding the steering wheel. The golf cart has black seats and a gray and red logo on its side featuring the letter \"M\" and a star-like symbol. Both the man and the cart are clearly reflected on the polished floor.",
    "Motion": "A man executes an acrobatic side flip in mid-air, landing on the reflective floor and stumbling as he rolls over. Initially facing the camera, he turns to the right of the frame and then faces left, moving backward a few steps to avoid being hit by a golf cart. On the left side of the frame, a woman sits motionless in the driver's seat, driving the golf cart towards the right of the frame.",
    "Scene": "The scene takes place in a spacious, modern indoor hall with white paneled walls and a highly reflective, glossy gray floor that mirrors the surroundings. The area is illuminated by natural sunlight streaming in from the side. A white and black golf cart-style vehicle, featuring a blue and white logo on its side, is positioned in the space. A person dressed in black performs an acrobatic flip in mid-air next to the cart, subsequently landing and rolling on the polished floor. In the background, a white door and a set of double doors with glass panels are visible.",
    "Spatial": "This is a wide shot filmed at the subjects' level. A golf cart with a driver is moving rightwards in the left-middle ground of the frame. In front of the golf cart, a man is initially seen mid-air in the center of the frame, also in the middle ground. The man then moves in an arc upwards and to the right, landing on the floor and finishing his movement on the right side of the frame. Although the golf cart appears stationary on the left throughout the clip, it is actually moving rightwards, with the camera tracking its motion. The highly reflective floor in the foreground mirrors the moving cart and the man's entire acrobatic motion."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
