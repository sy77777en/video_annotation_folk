  "merged_caption": "The video begins with a shot capturing the entire brown burlap satchel in the center foreground, as a pair of hands places a book inside it. A small stack of colorful cards is visible in the bottom left foreground. The camera starts with a high-angle view of the character's bag and smoothly tilts upward to their face, transitioning to a level angle. The scene is set indoors within a dimly lit room with warm, ambient lighting. The camera then tilts up, reframing the scene into a medium close-up that centers on a stop-motion puppet of a young girl with tan-colored skin and dark brown hair styled in two braids, wearing a white collared shirt under a dark jumper. Her appearance is atypical, characterized by a proportionally large head and dark-colored eyes. The camera remains stationary with an extremely shallow depth of field, keeping the character in the midground in sharp focus. The girl puppet lifts her head from a bowed position, turning her head to her right as she looks upward. A second puppet's hand enters the frame from the top right to pat her head, followed by the figure's head, which enters from the top of the frame to kiss her forehead before both the hand and head exit. The shot concludes with the girl remaining in the center of the frame, looking upward and smiling. The background is dark and out of focus, suggesting a cluttered space. The camera is positioned at the subject's eye level, aligning with the subject's eye level as the subject is positioned on the ground.",

    "Camera": "This stop-motion animation is filmed from hip level, aligning with the subject's eye level as the subject is positioned on the ground. The camera starts with a high-angle view of the character's bag and smoothly tilts upward to their face, transitioning to a level angle. After the tilt, the camera remains stationary. The shot uses an extremely shallow depth of field, keeping the character in the midground in sharp focus.",
    "Subject": "A stop-motion puppet of a young girl with tan-colored skin and dark brown hair styled in two braids is shown wearing a white collared shirt under a dark jumper. Her appearance is atypical, characterized by a proportionally large head and dark-colored eyes. She interacts with a worn, brown burlap satchel featuring two silver-colored metal clasps. The hands and head of a second puppet with short, dark hair are briefly seen as they pat and then kiss the top of the girl's head.",
    "Motion": "A puppet's hands place a book into a brown burlap satchel. The scene then focuses on a girl puppet who lifts her head from a bowed position, turning her head to her right as she looks upward. A second puppet's hand enters the frame from above and pats her head, after which the second puppet's head leans down to kiss the top of the girl's head. The girl puppet then looks up and smiles.",
    "Scene": "The scene is set indoors within a dimly lit room with warm, ambient lighting. A worn, brown satchel made of a coarse, burlap-like fabric with two silver-colored metal clasps rests on a rough, textured mat on the floor. A small stack of colorful cards is placed beside the bag. The background is dark and out of focus, suggesting a cluttered space. A stop-motion figure of a girl with dark braided hair places an item into the open satchel.",
    "Spatial": "The video begins with a shot capturing the entire brown burlap satchel in the center foreground, as a pair of hands places an item inside it. A small stack of cards is visible in the bottom left foreground. The camera then tilts up, reframing the scene into a medium close-up that centers on a girl's head and shoulders. A second figure's hand enters the frame from the top right to pat her head, followed by the figure's head, which enters from the top of the frame to kiss her forehead before both the hand and head exit. The shot concludes with the girl remaining in the center of the frame, looking upward. The camera is positioned at the subject's eye level."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
