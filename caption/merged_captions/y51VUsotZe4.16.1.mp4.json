  "merged_caption": "This scenery video is presented as a wide shot from a level, forward-facing perspective, as if from inside a vehicle. The wet street occupies the bottom and center of the frame, stretching from the foreground into the background, with colorful reflections of lights visible throughout. Buildings adorned with neon signs line the left and right sides of the frame in the middle ground. A prominent green sign for \"CHEERS\" is visible on the left, while another green sign for \"CLUB SUPERSTAR\" is on the right. Parked cars are positioned along both sides of the road in the middle ground. As the camera moves slowly forward at a steady pace, capturing the vibrant, nocturnal urban environment, the buildings and signs on the periphery drift towards and past the edges of the frame, while the view down the center of the street remains the primary focus. The camera is held at a fixed Dutch angle, tilting the view of the neon-lit street. A deep focus is employed, keeping the entire scene sharp from the foreground to the background. The scene is dominated by vibrant, glowing neon signs in various colors, including green, red, pink, and yellow, which cast long, shimmering reflections on the wet, dark asphalt. The street is lined with buildings adorned with numerous bright neon signs advertising various establishments in both English and Japanese script. Signs for \"CLUB SUPERSTAR\" and \"CHEERS\" are visible among the glowing advertisements. Other vehicles are parked along the road and moving in the distance, navigating the illuminated urban environment. There is no main subject in this video; the focus is on creating a specific mood and capturing the immersive, rain-slicked, neon-drenched atmosphere of the city.",

    "Camera": "This is a slightly unsteady, forward-moving shot from an eye-level perspective, likely from inside a vehicle. The camera is held at a fixed Dutch angle, tilting the view of the neon-lit street. A deep focus is employed, keeping the entire scene sharp from the foreground to the background.",
    "Subject": "This is a cityscape scenery shot capturing a drive through a bustling urban street at night. The scene is dominated by vibrant, glowing neon signs in various colors, including green, red, and yellow, which cast long, shimmering reflections on the wet, dark asphalt. Buildings line the street, their facades adorned with these luminous advertisements, while cars are parked along the road and visible in the distance. There is no main subject in this video; the focus is on creating a specific mood and capturing the immersive, rain-slicked, neon-drenched atmosphere of the city. The wide, slightly distorted perspective from what appears to be inside a vehicle enhances this focus on the environment rather than any single element within it.",
    "Motion": "This is a scenery shot from the perspective of a vehicle driving down a wet city street at night. The street is illuminated by numerous colorful neon signs, whose lights reflect off the slick pavement. The camera moves forward at a steady pace, capturing the vibrant, nocturnal urban environment.",
    "Scene": "A forward-facing dashcam view from a vehicle-mounted camera captures a slow drive through a city street at night. The pavement is wet from rain, creating slick, colorful reflections of the surrounding lights. The street is lined with buildings adorned with numerous bright neon signs in green, red, pink, and yellow, advertising various establishments in both English and Japanese script. Signs for \"CLUB SUPERSTAR\" and \"CHEERS\" are visible among the glowing advertisements. Other vehicles are parked along the road and moving in the distance, navigating the illuminated urban environment.",

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
