  "merged_caption": "This is a static, high-angle medium shot of a damaged robot positioned centrally in the frame, lying on a dark, gridded floor in a dimly lit, industrial setting. The robot's upper section is in the foreground and centrally positioned, while its lower mechanical limbs extend into the bottom right. Its complex, skeletal structure is a tangle of dark metal components, wires, and tubes, with some sections covered in off-white plating. Two small, red lights glow below a white light, resembling eyes, on one part of its body, while a cluster of glowing cyan orbs is situated on its upper body in the upper right portion of the frame, embedded within a dark, lumpy, organic-looking substance. The scene is illuminated by a faint overhead light, creating deep shadows and revealing dark stains spattered on the floor around the inert structure. The camera remains completely still throughout the shot, utilizing a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. Subtle movements are visible in the robot's head and arm, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise static composition.",

    "Camera": "A static, high-angle shot looks down on a broken mechanical creature, utilizing a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp.",
    "Subject": "In a dimly lit space, a damaged robot lies on a dark, gridded floor. Viewed from a high angle, its complex, skeletal structure is a tangle of dark metal components, wires, and tubes, with some sections covered in off-white plating. Two small, red lights glow below a white light, resembling eyes, on one part of its body. Meanwhile, some cyan lights are visible on different parts of the robot, embedded within a dark, lumpy, organic-looking substance.",
    "Motion": "The video shows a damaged robot lying on the floor, with subtle movements in its head and arm.",
    "Scene": "In a dark, industrial setting, a complex mechanical figure lies broken on a floor of gridded metal panels. The scene is illuminated by a faint overhead light, creating deep shadows. The figure is a jumble of metallic struts, a central chassis, and numerous black wires and tubes snaking across the floor. Two small red lights glow on parts of the machine, while a cluster of pale, luminous blue-green orbs with a lumpy texture rests on another section. Dark stains are spattered on the floor around the inert structure.",
    "Spatial": "This is a static, high-angle medium shot of a damaged robot positioned centrally in the frame. The robot's upper section is in the foreground and centrally positioned, while its lower mechanical limbs extend into the bottom right. Two red lights are visible on its head, and a cluster of glowing cyan orbs is situated on its upper body in the upper right portion of the frame. The dark, gridded floor occupies the entire background, and the camera remains completely still throughout the shot."

  "prompt": "Please merge the following five captions into a single, comprehensive caption that describes the video completely without any redundancy.\n\nCaption Types:\n1. Subject: Describes the subjects/people in the video\n2. Scene: Describes the scene composition and environment\n3. Motion: Describes the movement and dynamics of subjects\n4. Spatial: Describes the spatial relationships and framing\n5. Camera: Describes camera movements and framing choices\n\nInput Captions:\n{captions}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the SPATIAL caption as your BASE structure - it provides the core visual description and framing\n2. Merge MOTION and CAMERA captions into the spatial description to create a temporally coherent narrative that describes how things change over time\n3. Add information from SUBJECT and SCENE captions ONLY if they contain unique details not already covered in the Spatial caption\n4. Eliminate ALL redundant information - if the same detail appears in multiple captions, mention it only ONCE\n5. Preserve the EXACT wording from the original captions - do NOT paraphrase\n6. When describing temporal changes, integrate motion and camera movements in chronological order to show how the scene evolves\n7. CRITICAL: Every unique detail from all five captions must appear in the final merged caption - nothing should be omitted\n8. Do NOT add any information not present in the original captions\n9. Return only the merged caption without any additional text or formatting\n\nGoal: A single, temporally coherent caption based on the Spatial description, with Motion and Camera information merged chronologically, and Subject/Scene details added only when they provide new information. Keep as many details as possible but limit to at most 320 words.",
